<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">November 2002 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 11Z02 Vol. 45, No. 11</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Known the Truth About Jesus</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Anointed Christians, assisted by their other sheep companions, “have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.” (Rev. 12:17) This is an important assignment, since salvation is possible only through him.—John 17:3; Acts 4:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> ‘The Way, the Truth, and the Life’: </span><span class="font15">“I am the way and the truth and the life,” Jesus said. “No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6) Only through Jesus, “the way,” can we approach God in prayer and have an approved relationship with Him. (John 15:16) Jesus is “the truth” in that the prophecies and shadows contained in the Hebrew Scriptures became a reality in him. (John 1:17; Col. 2:16, 17) Indeed, the primary intent of true prophecy is to illuminate his central role in the outworking of God’s purpose. (Rev. 19:10) Further, Jesus is “the life.” To gain the blessing of everlasting life, all must exercise faith in his ransom sacrifice.—John 3:16, 36; Heb. 2:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Head and Reigning King: </span><span class="font15">People must also recognize the vast executive authority Jehovah has entrusted to his Son. Jesus has been installed as King of God’s Kingdom—‘to him the obedience of the peoples belongs.’ (Gen. 49:10) In addition, Jehovah has designated him as the Head of the congregation. (Eph. 1:22, 23) We need to help our Bible students to appreciate how Jesus directs the congregation and uses “the faithful and discreet slave” to supply spiritual “food at the proper time.” —Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Merciful High Priest: </span><span class="font15">Having experienced trials and suffering as a human, Jesus “is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test.” (Heb. 2: 17, 18) How heartwarming it is for imperfect humans to learn that Jesus sympathizes with their weaknesses and graciously pleads for them! (Rom. 8:34) On the basis of Jesus’ sacrifice and through his services as High Priest, we can approach Jehovah “with freeness of speech” in order to obtain “help at the right time.”—Heb. 4:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> May our efforts to acquaint others with the truth about Jesus move them to obey and serve him alongside us.—John 14:15, 21.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Assist Your Congregation Book Study Overseer</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Each of us derives many benefits from the Congregation Book Study. Last month we discussed how the Congregation Book Study overseer fulfills his role. But what can we do to assist him and thus benefit ourselves and others?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Attend Every Week: </span><span class="font15">Because book study groups are kept small, your presence makes a difference. Make it your aim to attend every week. You can also help by being punctual, as this allows the overseer to begin the meeting in an orderly manner. —1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Upbuilding Comments: </span><span class="font15">Another way you can assist is by being well prepared and by making upbuilding comments. Comments that focus on just one point are usually best, and this also encourages others to comment. Avoid trying to cover everything in a paragraph. If a point in the material touches your heart, enrich the discussion by sharing your thought in a comment.—1 Pet. 4:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> If you have the privilege of reading the paragraphs for the benefit of the group, be diligent in fulfilling that assignment. Good reading contributes to the success of the study.—1 Tim. 4:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Group Witnessing: </span><span class="font15">Meetings for field service are held at many book study locations, and your support of these arrangements helps the overseer as he takes the lead in the evangelizing work. View these arrangements as opportunities to draw closer to your brothers and to encourage them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Field Service Reports: </span><span class="font15">Submitting your field service report promptly at the end of each month is another way to assist the overseer. You may hand your report directly to him or place it in the box designated for service reports at the Kingdom Hall. The secretary can use the box to gather the field service reports collected by book study overseers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Your cooperation with your Congregation Book Study overseer will not go unnoticed. Above all, you can be assured that Jehovah will “be with the spirit you show.”—Phil. 4:23.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>A School That Equips Us for What Matters Most</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> People go to school to get instruction that will help them reach their goals in life. What goal, however, could be more important than praising the very Giver of life and aiding others in learning his purposes and his ways? None. The objective of the Theocratic Ministry School is to prepare us to teach our faith to others. Thus, as we attend the school each week, we are acquiring skills that equip us for life’s most important activities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> The “Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 2003” was provided in last month’s issue of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font15"> The schedule includes details as to how the school will be conducted. You may find it practical to keep the schedule in your copy of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education,</span><span class="font15"> which you should bring with you to the Theocratic Ministry School each week. Consider some of the features of the Theocratic Ministry School for 2003.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Speech Quality: </span><span class="font15">Starting in January, each meeting will begin with a five-minute talk about a speech quality or an aspect of reading, studying, or teaching. The school overseer will present these opening discussions, or he may assign another qualified elder to give this talk. The speaker may discuss the definition and importance of the speech quality. He should then enlarge on the material by discussing Scriptural examples and demonstrating how to employ the quality, focusing particular attention on how doing so can enhance our field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Assignment No. 1: </span><span class="font15">Brothers assigned to give the instruction talk are again advised to “focus attention on the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">practical value</span><span class="font15"> of the information being discussed.” This means showing the congregation how to make use of the information. If you receive this assignment, consult pages 48-9 of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font15"> textbook for suggestions on how to prepare, and study the references shown in the book’s index under “Practical application.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Bible Reading Schedule: </span><span class="font15">If, in times past, you have not been able to keep up with the weekly Bible reading, why not resolve to stick to the schedule this year? Those who do so will complete the Christian Greek Scriptures by the end of the year. The benefits of starting a Bible-reading program with the Christian Greek Scriptures are considered on page 10, paragraph 4, of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font15"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Highlights From Bible Reading: </span><span class="font15">This part has been lengthened to ten minutes so that the audience can offer comments on the week’s reading. Those assigned should stick to the allotted time. It will be presented every week, including the week of the oral review. As you read the assigned chapters, look for points that will benefit you in your family study, in your ministry, or in your way of life. What qualities of Jehovah were manifested in his dealings with people and nations? What did you learn that strengthened your faith and built your appreciation for Jehovah? Feel free to comment on any point in the assigned chapters, even from verses to be read during Assignment No. 2, since the brother handling the reading will not comment on the verses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Assignment No. 2: </span><span class="font15">The first student assignment each week will be an exercise in public reading. All but the last reading for each month will be drawn from the week’s Bible reading. The final reading of the month will be taken from </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font15"> The student should read the assigned material without giving an introduction or a conclusion. In this way, he can focus his primary attention on his reading skills.—1 Tim. 4:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Assignments No. 3 and No. 4: </span><span class="font15">Some of these assignments have more source material from the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font15"> book than others; some have just a theme. Those given assignments with limited source material or with just a theme will have the opportunity to develop their presentations by doing research in our Christian publications. This may make it easier for sisters to tailor their comments to their assistants.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Settings: </span><span class="font15">As indicated on page 45 of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font15"> book, the school overseer may assign a setting. If he does not, then sisters may select a setting from the list on page 82. If a sister gives one talk every two months, the 30 settings will provide enough variety to last for five years. Sisters choosing No. 30, namely, “Another setting appropriate to your area,” should write the setting at the bottom or on the back of their assignment slip (S-89). The school overseer will write the date of the student’s talk on page 82 of her book next to the setting that she used. He can do this at the same time that he marks the student’s counsel form.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Oral Review: </span><span class="font15">The Theocratic Ministry School review will be conducted orally. It will be held once every two months and will last for 30 minutes. Questions to be considered during the review will continue to appear in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font15"> If the week scheduled for the oral review coincides with the week of a circuit assembly or the circuit overseer’s visit, then the next week’s talks should be given one week early and the oral review should be rescheduled for the following week.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Auxiliary Classes: </span><span class="font15">In congregations with a school enrollment larger than 50, the elders may consider the use of auxiliary classes. “This arrangement might be used for all student presentations or just for the last two.” </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Ministry School,</span><span class="font15"> p. 285) The latter suggestion is made to accommodate congregations in which there are many sisters but only a few brothers to care for reading assignments. The elders should select qualified brothers to conduct these classes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Auxiliary Counselor: </span><span class="font15">As indicated in the Theocratic Ministry School schedule, an auxiliary counselor should be designated by the body of elders to offer private counsel to elders and ministerial servants who present Bible highlights and give instruction talks. The brother assigned to do this should be experienced, one whose counsel will be respected by the other elders. His counsel should be constructive, commending good speaking and teaching techniques and recommending one or two points for improvement. There is no need to offer counsel after every talk given by a brother who speaks frequently. However, the brother assigned to do this counseling should be discerning and appreciate that even brothers who now give public talks can be helped to make further progress.—1 Tim. 4:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> What to Listen For: </span><span class="font15">What can assist a counselor in analyzing a presentation? The third box in most of the 53 numbered chapters of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font15"> book contains a brief summary of what to listen for. The school overseer should also take note of other reminders or suggestions in the book that will help him to assess quickly the coherent development and effectiveness of a presentation. For example, note the series of questions at the top of page 55 and the ideas in the last paragraph on page 163.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> Fill in the Blanks: </span><span class="font15">In addition to its wide margins, the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font15"> book has a number of blank spaces designed for you to add notes during your personal study and when you attend the Theocratic Ministry School. (See pages 77, 92, 165, 243, 246, and 250.) Be sure to bring your book with you each week. Follow along during the opening talk. Keep your book open for the remainder of the school. Note the suggestions made by the school overseer. Pay attention to teaching methods, questions, examples, figures of speech, illustrations, visual aids, and contrasts used by the speakers. By taking good notes, you will be able to recall and use the many rich points gleaned from the school.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>16</sup> Jesus Christ appreciated that preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom is the greatest privilege that can be extended to anyone. It was his main commission. (Mark 1:38) He said: “I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this I was sent forth.” (Luke 4:43) As those who have accepted the invitation to follow him, we too are intensely occupied with preaching the good news, and we are always striving to improve the quality of our “sacrifice of praise.” (Heb. 13:15) To that end, may we be determined to participate regularly in the Theocratic Ministry School, a school that will help to prepare us for what matters most in life.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Family Heads—Maintain a Good Spiritual Routine</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Despite living for decades amid the idolatry and corruption of Babylon, Daniel was known for serving Jehovah “with constancy.” (Dan. 6:16, 20) How did he maintain his spirituality? The Bible record indicates that he had an orderly routine for carrying out activities related to true worship. For example, he customarily prayed three times a day from his roof chamber. (Dan. 6:10) Undoubtedly, he also had a set pattern for other spiritual activities, such as reading the Law. Thus, when confronted by a life-threatening trial, Daniel was unwavering in his devotion to Jehovah, and he was miraculously delivered.—Dan. 6: 4-22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Similarly today, we must exert ourselves to “keep awake with all constancy.” (Eph. 6:18) The world we live in is “lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1 John 5:19) Opposition or trials can arise suddenly and put our faith to the test. During the great tribulation, God’s servants will be the object of an all-out attack by Gog of Magog, from which there will appear to be no escape. This will call for complete trust in Jehovah.—Ezek. 38:14-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> “One vital key is making effective family Bible reading, study, and discussion a way of life.” So stated the introduction to the 1998 district convention drama entitled “Families—Make Daily Bible Reading Your Way of Life!” It continued: “When families follow such a program regularly and in a manner that makes the Bible come alive, this Bible-oriented routine can have a tremendous impact on the family. It builds our knowledge. It strengthens our faith. And it provides us with role models—profoundly faithful men and women of ancient times—who can inspire us, moving us to stand up for the truth.” As we consider various aspects of a good spiritual routine, family heads should look for one or two ways to improve their family’s spiritual program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Consider God’s Word Daily: </span><span class="font15">“When God’s Kingdom rules unopposed and his will is done on earth as it is in heaven, no vicious humans —no, not even animals—will ‘do any harm or cause any ruin.’ (Isa. 11:9; Matt. 6:9,10)” Those words appeared in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Examining the Scriptures Daily—2001</span><span class="font15"> in the comments on the scripture text for September 11. How comforting this reminder proved to be! As a family head, do you have the daily custom of considering the Bible text and comments with your family? This is most beneficial. If it is not practical to get together in the morning, perhaps you could do so later in the day. One father said: “The evening meal has been a good time for us to discuss the daily Bible text.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> If you already have a good routine for discussing the daily text as a family, you are to be commended. Perhaps you could build on this by reading a portion of the Bible at the same time. Some have the practice of reading the entire chapter from which the day’s text is taken. Others do consecutive reading, working progressively through a selected book of the Bible. Daily Bible reading will help your family to cultivate a wholesome fear of displeasing Jehovah and will deepen their desire to do his will.—Deut. 17:18-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> Your family’s Bible-reading program and daily text consideration will be even more beneficial if you can take a few minutes to discuss the practical value of the information. The </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font15"> textbook, page 60, offers this suggestion: “You might. . . select a few verses out of the Bible reading scheduled for the week, discuss their meaning, and then ask such questions as these: ‘How does this provide guidance for us? How might we use these verses in the ministry? What do they reveal about Jehovah and his way of doing things, and how does that build up our appreciation for him?’” Such spiritual conversations will help all in your household to “go on perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.”—Eph. 5:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Family Study: </span><span class="font15">Conducting the family study consistently each week is a fine way for family heads to show their children that spiritual things come first. One young man recalls: “Sometimes Dad would be so tired from work he could hardly keep awake, but the study was held regardless, and this helped us to appreciate the seriousness of it.” Children too can contribute to the success of the arrangement. One family with nine children regularly got up at five o’clock to have their family study because no other time was possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>8</sup> For the family study to be effective, the family head must ‘pay constant attention to his teaching.’ (1 Tim. 4:16) The </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font15"> textbook, page 32, states: “It could well be said that an effective family study begins with a study of your family itself. How are your family members progressing spiritually? . . . When you are in the field ministry with your children, do they feel comfortable identifying themselves before their peers as Jehovah’s Witnesses? Do they enjoy your program of family Bible reading and study? Are they really making Jehovah’s way their way of life? Careful observation will reveal what you, as a family head, need to do in order to establish and build up spiritual qualities in each family member.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Congregation Meetings: </span><span class="font15">Preparing for and attending congregation meetings should be an important part of your weekly routine. (Heb. 10:24, 25) At times, you may be able to prepare for some of the meetings as a family. Rather than waiting until the last minute, can you arrange to prepare well in advance? An orderly routine in this regard will improve both the quality of your preparation and the benefits you gain from the meetings. —Prov. 21:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>10</sup> Quality and consistency are hallmarks of an effective spiritual routine. What if circumstances make it difficult for you to prepare for all the meetings? The </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font15"> textbook, page 31, makes this suggestion: “Avoid the pitfalls of rushing through the material just to get it done or, worse, of not studying any of it because you cannot do it all. Instead, determine how much you can study, and do that well. Do it each week. In time, endeavor to broaden out to include the other meetings.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>11</sup> When families arrive at meetings early, this helps to put them in the proper frame of mind to praise Jehovah and benefit from the instruction he provides. Does your family have this custom? It requires good planning and the cooperation of everyone in the household. If you often find that your family rushes about and is under stress on meeting nights, can adjustments be made in your routine? Are there things that could be cared for in advance? If one member of the family is loaded down with much to do, could others help? Would it reduce stress if everyone was ready to leave for the meeting a few minutes earlier? Good order contributes to a spirit of peace both in the family and in the congregation. —1 Cor. 14:33, 40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Field Service: </span><span class="font15">Establishing set times for sharing in the ministry is another part of a good spiritual routine. A young man named Jayson recalls: “In my family, Saturday mornings were always devoted to field service. This was good for me because the more I went out in the ministry, the more I saw the good it accomplishes and the more I enjoyed it.” Many raised in Witness households have similarly observed that having a definite time for the ministry every week helped them to progress as Christian ministers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>13</sup> An orderly routine can also help to make the time your family spends in field service more enjoyable and more productive. How can this be accomplished? The July 1, 1999, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font15"> page 21, made the following suggestion: “Do you occasionally use time at your family study to assist the members of your household to prepare for the week’s field service? Doing so can be very beneficial. (2 Timothy 2:15) It can help to make their service meaningful and productive. Occasionally, you might set aside an entire study session for such preparation. More often, you might deal with aspects of the field ministry in shorter discussions at the end of the family study or at some other time during the week.” Has your family tried this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> Go On Making Progress: </span><span class="font15">From this consideration, have you noted areas in which your family is doing well? Commend them, and endeavor to build on these. If you see several areas that need improvement, select one or two to work on first. When they have become part of your spiritual routine, work on one or two more. Be positive and reasonable. (Phil. 4:4, 5) Establishing a good spiritual routine for your household takes real effort, but it is well worth it, for Jehovah assures us: “As for the one keeping a set way, I will cause him to see salvation by God.”—Ps. 50:23.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font15">■ What are the advantages of attending the congregation that holds the territory where we live?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Through the congregation arrangement, we receive encouragement ‘inciting us to love and fine works.’ (Heb. 10: 24, 25) Through the congregation we learn the truth and are equipped to fulfill our assignment to make disciples. (Matt. 28:19,20) We are also strengthened to endure trials faithfully and are provided with loving overseers to help us cope with mounting pressures and anxieties. Clearly, the congregation is vital to our spiritual survival. However, are there advantages in attending the congregation that holds the territory where we live?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Individual circumstances vary, and such factors as secular employment, an unbelieving mate, and transportation may affect one’s final decision in this regard. Yet, there are definite advantages, both spiritual and otherwise, when a person associates with the congregation holding the territory where he lives. The elders may be able to get in touch with all the publishers more quickly in cases of emergency. Past Question Boxes have highlighted a number of other advantages.—May 1991, March 1976, and January 1967.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Generally, it is more convenient to attend meetings nearby, allowing us to arrive early enough to speak with others, care for necessary matters, and share in the opening song and prayer. When newly interested ones live in our neighborhood, we are usually in a better position to reach them, conduct Bible studies with them, and direct them to the meetings most convenient for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">We are confident that family heads will prayerfully consider this matter, weighing all the factors involved in determining what is best for the spiritual and physical welfare of their family.—1 Tim. 5:8.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Show Loving Interest in “Fatherless Boys”</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is “a father of fatherless boys.” (Ps. 68:5) His concern for their welfare is reflected in this command that he gave the ancient nation of Israel: “You people must not afflict any widow or fatherless boy. If you should afflict him at all, then if he cries out to me at all, I shall unfailingly hear his outcry.” (Ex. 22:22, 23) God’s Law also included provision to assist such ones with their material needs. (Deut. 24:19-21) Under the Christian arrangement, true worshipers are admonished “to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation.” (Jas. 1:27) How can we imitate Jehovah’s loving interest in those growing up in single-parent or religiously divided families?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Spiritual Training: </span><span class="font15">If you are a single parent or have an unbelieving mate, conducting a regular home Bible study with your children may present a challenge. But a regular and meaningful Bible study is essential if they are to grow up to be balanced, mature adults. (Prov. 22:6) Having daily conversations with them about spiritual matters is also vital. (Deut. 6:6-9) At times, you may feel discouraged, but do not give up. Turn to Jehovah for strength and guidance as you “go on bringing [your children] up in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.” —Eph. 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> If you need some assistance in shouldering your Scriptural responsibilities, let your needs be known to the elders. They may be able to offer practical suggestions or assist you in establishing a good spiritual routine for your household.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> How Others Can Help: </span><span class="font15">In the first century, Timothy became a zealous servant of Jehovah despite growing up in a religiously divided household. The diligent efforts of his mother and grandmother to teach him the holy writings in his youth doubtless had much to do with this. (Acts 16:1, 2; 2 Tim. 1:5; 3:15) However, he also benefited from association with other Christians, including the apostle Paul, who referred to Timothy as his “beloved and faithful child in the Lord.”—1 Cor. 4:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Likewise today, how beneficial it is when spiritually mature brothers and sisters take a loving interest in the fatherless boys and girls in the congregation! Do you know each one by name? Do you talk with them at Christian meetings and on other occasions? Invite them to join you in the field ministry. Perhaps you could occasionally include them, along with their single or believing parent, in your family study or in arrangements for wholesome recreation. When these younger ones view you as their friend, they are more likely to take to heart your example and encouragement—Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah is deeply interested in fatherless boys and girls, and he is blessing our loving efforts to help them make the truth their own. Many who grew up in single-parent or divided households received such encouragement and are now serving faithfully as pioneers, ministerial servants, elders, traveling overseers, missionaries, or Bethel family members. May all of us look for ways to “widen out” in our affection for fatherless ones, in imitation of our heavenly Father.—2 Cor. 6:11-13.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Sowing Bountifully Brings Rich Blessings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> All of us look forward to the fulfillment of the grand promises contained in God’s Word. Even now, Jehovah makes available many blessings that add delight to our lives. The extent to which we personally benefit, however, depends in large measure on the effort we put forth. As the apostle Paul put it, “he that sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.” (2 Cor. 9:6) Consider two areas in which this principle applies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Our Personal Ministry: </span><span class="font12">Sharing the good news with people when it is within our power to give a witness brings many rewards. (Prov. 3:27, 28) Commendably, many are sowing bountifully by expanding their share in the ministry, including auxiliary or regular pioneering. All of us can sow bountifully by conscientiously returning to cultivate all interest that is found and by offering a Bible study whenever the opportunity presents itself. (Rom. 12:11) Exerting ourselves in these ways results in upbuilding experiences and increased joy in our ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Supporting Kingdom Interests: </span><span class="font12">Paul made his comment about ‘sowing bountifully’ in connection with material giving. (2 Cor. 9:6, 7, 11, 13) Today, there is much we can do in a physical and material way to support Kingdom interests. We can assist in the construction of Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls. We can also make ourselves available to share in cleaning and maintaining these centers for true worship. In addition, we can contribute financially for local congregation expenses as well as for the worldwide Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work. As all of us do our part, how we rejoice to see Jehovah’s abundant blessing upon this God-ordained work!—Mal. 3:10; Luke 6:38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> God’s Word exhorts us “to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be liberal, ready to share.” As we heed that admonition, we enjoy rich blessings now. At the same time, we are “safely treasuring up for [ourselves] a fine foundation for the future [and] the real life” to come.—1 Tim. 6:18, 19.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Want</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> to” Help Others?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jesus truly cared about people. When a leper entreated him for help, Jesus stretched out his hand, touched the man, and said: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“I want to.</span><span class="font12"> Be made clean.” (Mark 1:40-42) In what ways can we imitate Jesus’ attitude toward helping others?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Interested People: </span><span class="font12">Each member of the congregation plays a part in helping interested ones to become worshipers of Jehovah. When new ones come to meetings, greet them and get acquainted. Look for ways to encourage them. Commend them for the comments they make. Express appreciation for their efforts to apply Bible principles in their lives. Help them to see the prospects they have for making true friends within the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Fellow Believers: </span><span class="font12">“Those related to us in the faith” especially deserve our help in a variety of ways. (Gal. 6:10) Many contend with health problems. By making an encouraging visit, you can provide vital association and perhaps also assist in practical ways. Some may be facing other difficulties in their lives. Show your concern by taking the time to listen to them and build them up. (1 Thess. 5:14) The elders too need our cooperation as they carry out their responsibilities. (Heb. 13: 17) By displaying a willing and helpful spirit, we can “become a strengthening aid” to our fellow believers.—Col. 4:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Family Members: </span><span class="font12">We should also strive to imitate Jesus’ concern for people within our own family circle. Deep concern moves parents to ‘go on bringing up their children in the discipline and mentalregulating of Jehovah.’ (Eph. 6:4) Children can do their part by promptly getting ready when it is time for family study, congregation meetings, or field service. Grown children can reflect Jesus’ compassion by tenderly helping their parents cope with the difficulties brought on by advancing age. In these and other ways, all of us can “practice godly devotion in [our] own household.”—1 Tim. 5:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> As we imitate Jesus in helping others, we may be able to alleviate problems and to draw our family and the congregation closer together. Most important of all, we bring honor to Jehovah, “the Father of tender mercies.”—2 Cor. 1:3.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">■ What standard of dress and grooming should we observe when visiting Bethel homes and branch facilities?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When we visit Bethel, whether to tour the facility or to visit with members of the Bethel family, “our dress, grooming and conduct should be similar to what is expected of us when attending meetings for worship at the Kingdom Hall.” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(om</span><span class="font12"> 131) However, it has been noted that when visiting the branch offices, some brothers and sisters tend to be extremely casual in their dress. That is not appropriate when visiting these facilities. Our appearance should be exemplary, well-arranged, and modest, reflecting the decency and dignity that befit servants of Jehovah God.—1 Tim. 2:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This is especially important when visiting Bethel homes and branch facilities because they attract the attention of many non-Witness observers. Such onlookers may form opinions about God’s people and his organization based on what they observe. It would be good to speak with Bible students and others who may be visiting to remind them of the importance of giving attention to proper dress and grooming. The Bethel family will appreciate your doing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As Christian ministers, we must be careful that our appearance does not give any cause for stumbling. (2 Cor. 6: 3, 4) Rather, by our proper decorum, may we always “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things.”—Titus 2:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The Scriptures admonish us to provide materially for our household, but this should not become our main focus in life. Spiritual things must come first. (Matt. 6:33; 1 Tim. 5:8) Finding the proper balance is a challenge in these “critical times hard to deal with.” (2 Tim. 3:1) What will help us to do so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Adopt the Bible’s Viewpoint: </span><span class="font12">God’s Word warns us that the pursuit of riches can cause spiritual ruin. (Eccl. 5:10; Matt. 13:22; 1 Tim. 6:9, 10) At this crucial hour, it would be disastrous for any of us to become so preoccupied with secular employment or financial concerns that we relegate spiritual activities—meetings, study, and service—to a secondary place in our lives. (Luke 21:34-36) In contrast, the Bible counsels: “Having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.”—1 Tim. 6:7, 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> This does not mean that Christians are required to live in self-imposed poverty. But it helps us to identify what our material needs really are—food, clothing, and shelter adequate for where we live. If we have the necessities of life, we should not endlessly pursue a higher standard of living. When contemplating making a purchase or taking on additional work, we do well to ask ourselves, ‘Is this really necessary?’ Doing so will help us to heed the inspired counsel: “Let your manner of life be free of the love of money, while you are content with the present things.”—Heb. 13:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> If we trust in Jehovah, he will bless us. (Prov. 3:5, 6) Though we have to work hard to obtain the daily necessities, we do not center our lives on those things. Whether we have little or much, we rely on Jehovah to satisfy our needs. (Phil. 4:11-13) As a result, we enjoy godly contentment along with many other blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Imitate the Faith of Others: </span><span class="font12">A single parent who was raising her daughter in the way of the truth simplified her life progressively. Although she enjoyed the comforts of her home, she moved to a smaller house and later to an apartment. This enabled her to reduce her work hours so that she could devote more time to the ministry. After her daughter was grown and married, the mother took an early retirement, even though this meant a further reduction in her income. Our sister is now in her seventh year as a regular pioneer and has no regrets concerning the material sacrifices she has made to put Kingdom interests first in her life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> An elder and his wife pioneered for many years while bringing up three children. As a family, they learned to be content with satisfying their </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">needs</span><span class="font12"> rather than indulging their </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">wants.</span><span class="font12"> The brother comments: “We had to live more simply. Though we’ve had some difficult times, Jehovah has always provided what we needed. .. . When I see my family putting spiritual interests first like this, I feel that everything is as it should be, and I have a sense of accomplishment.” His wife adds: “When I see [my husband] busy with spiritual matters, I feel a deep inner contentment.” The children too are glad that their parents decided to serve Jehovah full-time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> For all those who choose such a course of godly devotion over the pursuit of material things, the Bible promises rich blessings both now and in the life to come.—1 Tim. 4:8.</span></p></li></ul>

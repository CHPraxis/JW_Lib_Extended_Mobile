<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Work That Refreshes</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> The Bible’s message refreshes all who accept and apply it in their lives. (Ps. 19: 7, 8) It helps them break free from false teachings and harmful practices and offers a reliable hope for the future. However, those who receive the good news are not the only ones to benefit. Those who share refreshing Bible truths with others are themselves also refreshed.—Prov. 11:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Invigorated by the Ministry: </span><span class="font16">Jesus said that those who accept the yoke of Christian discipleship, which includes the work of preaching and making disciples, would “find refreshment for [their] souls.” (Matt. 11:29) He himself found witnessing to others invigorating. It was like food for him. (John 4:34) When he sent forth the 70 disciples to preach, they rejoiced as they saw Jehovah backing their efforts.—Luke 10:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Many Christians today are likewise invigorated by their participation in the preaching work. One sister said: “The ministry is refreshing because it gives my life direction and purpose. Personal problems and everyday stresses fade into the background when I share in the service.” Another zealous minister said: “The ministry... makes Jehovah real to me on a daily basis and gives me peace and a measure of inward happiness that cannot be attained by any other means.” What a privilege we have to be “God’s fellow workers”!—1 Cor. 3:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Christ’s Yoke is Kindly: </span><span class="font16">While Christians are exhorted to ‘exert themselves vigorously,’ Jesus does not demand more than we are able to give. (Luke 13:24) Indeed, he lovingly invites us to ‘get under his yoke with him.’ (Matt. 11:29, ftn.) Those who must contend with difficult circumstances can be confident that their whole-souled service, even if limited, is well-pleasing to God.—Mark 14:6-8; Col. 3:23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> How refreshing it is to serve a God who appreciates whatever we do for the sake of his name! (Heb. 6:10) May we always strive to give him our best.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Imitate Jehovah’s Goodness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> After enjoying a glorious sunset or a tasty meal, are we not moved to thank Jehovah, the Source of all goodness? His goodness impels us to want to imitate him. (Ps. 119:66, 68; Eph. 5:1) How can we manifest the quality of goodness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Toward Unbelievers: </span><span class="font16">One way we can imitate Jehovah’s goodness is by showing sincere concern for those not related to us in the faith. (Gal. 6:10) Showing goodness in practical ways can have a positive effect on how they view Jehovah’s Witnesses and the message we bear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> For example, while waiting at a medical clinic, a young pioneer brother sat next to an elderly woman who seemed sicker than most of the others present. When his turn came to see the doctor, he allowed the woman to take his place. He later met her again, this time in the market, and she was very happy to see him. Although she had previously been unreceptive to the good news, she said that she now knew that Jehovah’s Witnesses truly love their neighbors. A regular Bible study was started with her.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Toward Our Brothers: </span><span class="font16">We also imitate Jehovah’s goodness when we extend ourselves to help fellow believers. In times of disaster, we are among the first to come to the aid of our brothers. We show this same spirit when we assist those needing transportation to meetings, visit infirm ones, and widen out in affection for those we do not know well in the congregation.—2 Cor. 6:1113; Heb. 13:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> Another way that Jehovah shows goodness is in his being “ready to forgive.” (Ps. 86:5) In imitation of him, we can demonstrate our love of goodness by extending forgiveness to others. (Eph. 4:32) This helps to make our association with fellow believers ‘good and pleasant.’—Ps. 133:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> May Jehovah’s abundant goodness cause us to bubble over with praise for him and to become radiant with joy. And may it move us to strive to imitate his goodness in all that we do.—Ps. 145:7; Jer. 31:12.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Let Us Keep Our Place of Worship in Good Repair</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Worldwide there are more than 94,000 congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Most congregations assemble for Bible study and Christian association at a Kingdom Hall, which serves as a local center of pure worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Regularly Scheduled Cleaning: </span><span class="font0">The work performed in maintaining the Kingdom Hall is a vital part of our sacred service. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font0"> book states on pages 61-2: “The brothers should consider it a privilege not only to support the Kingdom Hall financially but also to volunteer their services in keeping it clean, presentable and in good repair. Both inside and out, the Kingdom Hall should be a proper representation of Jehovah’s organization.” With the Kingdom Hall in use several times each week, there is a need for regular cleaning and maintenance. Usually volunteers from the congregation(s) meeting in the Kingdom Hall care for these matters. As in Bible times, Jehovah’s servants today should be diligent in “mending and repairing” our place of worship. —2 Chron. 34:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> A schedule for the weekly cleaning of the Kingdom Hall should be posted on the information board. All book study groups should take turns in cleaning the hall each week, following a list of things to be done. All who are able need to share in the weekly privilege of keeping the Kingdom Hall clean and presentable. With parental</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">1. What purpose does the Kingdom Hall serve? 2. Why is it important to keep the Kingdom Hall clean and presentable?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16">3. How is the cleaning of the Kingdom Hall organized, and who may have a share in this privilege?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">supervision, children can be included, thereby teaching them to show appreciation for this privilege. Especially when more than one congregation uses a Kingdom Hall, good cooperation is essential so that caring for this important aspect of our worship does not fall on just a few.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> A list of things to be done may be posted, possibly where the supplies are kept. This list should explain duties to be performed weekly, including vacuuming, cleaning windows, dusting countertops, emptying wastebaskets, mopping floors, and cleaning mirrors. Some jobs may need to be done less regularly, such as polishing any wood furniture and thoroughly cleaning chairs, draperies, and light fixtures. All chemicals used in cleaning should be kept out of the reach of children and should be clearly labeled. A brief explanation of how each chemical is to be used should be given.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Safety at the Kingdom Hall is of paramount importance. (Deut. 22:8) In this regard, the box on page 4 lists some items that need to be checked periodically so that accidents can be prevented.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Maintaining the Kingdom Hall: </span><span class="font0">The body of elders has the responsibility to supervise the maintenance of the Kingdom Hall. Generally, an elder</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font16">6. How is the work of maintaining the Kingdom Hall coordinated?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">or a ministerial servant is appointed to coordinate the work. He organizes the day-to-day operation of the Kingdom Hall, making sure that it is kept clean and in good repair and that there are sufficient supplies on hand. It is important that no hazardous conditions exist in the hall or on the grounds. When two or more congregations use the same hall, the bodies of elders appoint an operating committee to organize the arrangements for the care of the building and property. This committee works under the direction of the bodies of elders.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> A detailed inspection of the Kingdom Hall is made annually. The elders follow through by setting up arrangements to care thoroughly for any matters needing attention. The publishers may be invited to assist with needed repairs and maintenance. All should be alert to care for details and should be quick to expedite matters needing attention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> If the elders feel a need for advice or assistance in caring for maintenance of the Kingdom Hall, they may contact the Regional Building Committee. This might include such matters as carpet care, the servicing of heating and air-conditioning units, and the remedying of moisture problems in the building.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Using Congregation Funds Wisely: </span><span class="font0">Most of the work on the Kingdom Hall and the grounds is performed by volunteers. Their self-sacrificing efforts are a fine expression of love and</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font16">9. What procedure should be followed if there is a need to hire a contractor?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">aid greatly in reducing costs. If it becomes necessary to hire a contractor to care for some work, such as pest control or snow removal, the elders seek competitive bids for such work. They do this by first preparing a detailed written description of the work to be performed and any materials to</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Safety Checklist</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">□ Fire extinguishers should be easily accessible and serviced annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">□ Any sprinkler systems should be inspected in compliance with local law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">□ Exits and stairs should be clearly marked, well-lit, and freely accessible, and the handrails should be secure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">□ Storage rooms, restrooms, and coatrooms should be clean, orderly, and free of highly combustible materials, personal items, and trash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">□ Roof and gutters should be inspected and cleaned regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">□ Sidewalks and parking area must be lighted and kept free of conditions that might cause slipping or falling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">□ Electrical, heating, and ventilation systems should be checked and properly serviced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">□ Any leaks should be fixed quickly to prevent serious moisture problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">□ The building should be locked when there is no one on the premises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">be supplied. A copy of this list is given to a number of competing suppliers so that all bid with the same understanding of the requirements. After receiving written bids from several prospective providers, the elders can then select the best offer. This procedure should be followed even if a brother has offered to do the work or supply the needed materials at a specified price.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> The elders also take appropriate steps to obtain property- and sales-tax exemption, where this is available. When more than one congregation uses the Kingdom Hall, the operating committee maintains a separate checking account and shares monthly written financial reports with each body of elders, thus keeping the elders advised of how the funds are being spent. The elders are responsible for proper disbursement of congregation funds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Extensive Maintenance and Renovation: </span><span class="font0">When the operating committee feels that something major is needed in connection with the Kingdom Hall’s operation or maintenance, the committee refers the matter to the bodies of elders for direction. If it is determined that extensive maintenance or renovation will be necessary or that help will be needed from outside the congregation(s) meeting at that Kingdom Hall, the elders contact the Regional Building Committee. These qualified, experienced brothers provide helpful suggestions and oversight in directing the work. If a major expense is involved, it will be necessary to obtain accurate cost estimates and prepare a resolution for congregation approval.—See the</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">New Special Assembly Day Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">Much information is available these days about keeping our literal heart in good condition so as to have a more enjoyable and longer life. Of even greater importance is the condition of our figurative heart. How appropriate, then, is the theme of the special assembly day program beginning in September 2003: “Serving Jehovah With a Complete Heart.” (1 Chron. 28:9) What can we look forward to learning?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The circuit overseer will discuss “Helping Others to Serve Jehovah With a Delightful Soul.” Interviews will highlight the joy that results from cultivating interest and conducting Bible studies with people who want to serve Jehovah. All in attendance will no doubt derive comfort and encouragement from the visiting speaker’s first talk, “Guarding Our Hearts in a Troubled World.” The morning session will conclude with the baptism talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the afternoon, the part “Extending a Helping Hand” will consider how we can assist others. What can parents do to shield their children’s hearts from wrong influences and help them draw close to Jehovah? The part “Help Your Children Take Delight in Jehovah” will provide practical suggestions and will demonstrate how this can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Are we taking advantage of every provision Jehovah makes to keep our figurative heart healthy and strong? The visiting speaker’s final talk, “Maintain a Complete Heart in Serving Jehovah,” will focus on four essential aspects of our spiritual maintenance program. How much time and effort do we devote to earnest prayer, to studying God’s Word, to zealously preaching, and to associating with other Christians? Can we improve in any of these areas?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Jehovah extends the invitation: “Do bring your heart to discipline and your ear to the sayings of knowledge.” (Prov. 23:12) Plan now to attend this rewarding day of Scriptural instruction. Doing so will strengthen you to keep on serving Jehovah with a complete heart and a delightful soul.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> “I know that no other work could have brought me the satisfaction that has come from sharing the truth with others,” said one pioneer. Another stated: “At the end of each day, my sleep is sweet, and my heart is full of joy.” These pioneers speak for brothers and sisters everywhere who have tasted the blessings of the pioneer ministry.—Prov. 10:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Helping others to acquire the lifesaving knowledge of God’s Word brings genuine satisfaction. (Acts 20:35; 1 Thess. 2: 19, 20) “It is exciting and faithstrengthening to see how powerful God’s Word is in motivating people to make changes in their lives,” wrote a longtime pioneer. Yes, by making themselves available to help people and conduct Bible studies, pioneers put themselves in line for blessings like these.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Relying on Jehovah: </span><span class="font16">Daily relying on God’s spirit as they carry out their ministry helps pioneers to cultivate “the fruitage of the spirit” and serves as a protection for them. (Gal. 5:16, 22, 23) In addition, since they use God’s Word constantly, pioneers are often adept at using the Scriptures to defend the truth and to strengthen others. (2 Tim. 2:15) A brother who has pioneered for decades commented: “Pioneering has helped me to acquire a deep knowledge of the Bible, a knowledge I have used to help many people to get</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16">1,2. What blessings are closely associated with the pioneer ministry, and why?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">3, 4. How does pioneering teach one to rely on Jehovah, and how does this help one to grow spiritually?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">to know Jehovah and his purposes.” How rewarding!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> Regular pioneers must also rely on Jehovah in many other ways. Their faith is strengthened as they see how he blesses their efforts to provide for their material needs. A 72-year-old regular pioneer of 55 years stated: “Jehovah has never let me down.” Furthermore, by keeping their lives simple, pioneers safeguard themselves from many anxieties of life. Does this appeal to you?—Matt. 6:22; Heb. 13:5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Drawing Close to God: </span><span class="font16">Our relationship with Jehovah is a most precious possession. (Ps. 63:3) When we share fully in the ministry out of love for Jehovah, that relationship grows closer. (Jas. 4:8) A pioneer of over 18 years said: “The pioneer service allows us to ‘taste and see that Jehovah is good,’ day after day knitting an ever stronger relationship with our Creator.”—Ps. 34:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> In addition to having the necessary circumstances, pioneers must have strong faith, genuine love of God and neighbor, and a willingness to make sacrifices. (Matt. 16:24; 17:20; 22:37-39) However, as the beaming faces of pioneers everywhere testify, the blessings of the pioneer ministry are surpassing. (Mal. 3:10) These blessings are not limited to just the pioneers, but their families and the congregation also greatly benefit from the fine spirit the pioneers show.—Phil. 4:23.</span></p></li></ul>

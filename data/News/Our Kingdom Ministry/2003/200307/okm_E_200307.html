<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">July 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 7/03 Vol. 46, No. 7</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gratitude for God’s Mercy</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">'Before becoming a Christian, the apostle Paul was violently opposed to the spread of Christianity. However, because he acted in ignorance, he was shown mercy. Jehovah demonstrated undeserved kindness, and Paul was given an assignment to preach. He treasured that assignment. (Acts 26:9-18; 1 Tim. 1:12-14) Gratitude for Jehovah’s mercy moved Paul to expend himself in fulfilling his ministry.—2 Cor. 12:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> According to God’s mercy, we too have been given a ministry. (2 Cor. 4:1) Like Paul, we can demonstrate our appreciation for the mercy shown us by exerting ourselves in helping others to progress spiritually. One way we can do this is by starting and conducting Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Starting Bible Studies: </span><span class="font9">A way to start Bible studies is by establishing a magazine route. As we regularly visit those on our route, we become better acquainted with their concerns. In time, an article in one of the magazines may serve as a springboard for introducing a Bible study in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font9"> brochure. On subsequent visits, it may be possible to continue discussions in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font9"> brochure when placing magazines with the householder.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup>Prayerful Effort Needed: </span><span class="font9">Prayer coupled with diligent effort will enhance our preaching activity. A pioneer sister who had one Bible study prayed that Jehovah would bless her with more. She also acted in harmony with her prayers. She made an examination of her ministry and noted that she had not been offering Bible studies when making return visits. She began doing so and soon had two more studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> How privileged we are to share in making known “the good news of the undeserved kindness of God”! (Acts 20:24) May gratitude for God’s mercy move us to be diligent in helping others to benefit from Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Group Witnessing Brings Joy</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> When sending forth 70 disciples to preach, Jesus instructed them on what to say, organized them into teams of two, and outlined the territory they were to cover. This contributed to the joy they experienced. (Luke 10:1-17) Similarly today, group witnessing helps to equip, organize, and encourage God’s people for the preaching work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Elders Take the Lead: </span><span class="font9">Elders play a vital role in helping all to have a regular share in the preaching work. The service overseer takes the lead in making arrangements for midweek service. Each book study overseer is responsible for organizing the activity for his group, especially on the weekend. On occasions when the entire congregation meets for field service, such as following the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> Study, each book study overseer should care for the needs of his own group.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> “Decently and by Arrangement”: </span><span class="font9">The one designated to conduct the meeting for field service should begin on time and limit the meeting to 10 or 15 minutes. It is best that he arrange the witnessing groups and assign territory (unless the book study overseers will be caring for this, as noted earlier) before concluding with prayer. This reduces the need for publishers to congregate in the territory, which can detract from the dignity of our work. It is also in harmony with Paul’s counsel: “Let all things take place decently and by arrangement.” (1 Cor. 14:40) All who attend these meetings should contribute to the success of the arrangement by arriving on time, cooperating fully with the one taking the lead, and departing promptly for the territory once the group is dismissed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Drawn Together in Unity: </span><span class="font9">Group witnessing arrangements provide an excellent opportunity for us to get to know others in the congregation. While there is no objection to arranging in advance to work with someone, it can also be rewarding for us to attend meetings for field service without having prior arrangements. We may be assigned to work with someone we do not know well, thus enabling us to “widen out” in our love.—2 Cor. 6: 11-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Group witnessing encourages us and draws us together as “fellow workers in the truth.” (3 John 8) May we share fully in it!</span></p>

(2 Pet. 1: 5-8) (3) It helps us to use our time and resources in the most worthwhile way. (1 Tim. 6:17-19) (4) It provides a sure hope for the future. (2 Pet. 3:13) (5) It enables us to develop an intimate relationship with Jehovah. (Jas. 4:8) Contrast how these things are lacking among those who do not know or serve Jehovah.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Our Master foretold that his disciples would have tribulation. (Matt. 24:9) How are we to view trials? What will enable us to endure tribulation? The circuit assembly program for the 2004 service year will answer these questions. The theme is “Rejoice in the Hope. Endure Under Tribulation.” —Rom. 12:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Two Symposiums: </span><span class="font10">The first symposium, entitled “Bear Fruit With Endurance,” will consider ways in which we bear fruit. Several publishers will be interviewed on how they preach and teach with a sense of urgency. Parents especially will want to pay attention to the part “When Disciplined by Jehovah,” which will discuss how parents can reason with their children. The final speaker of the symposium will highlight what we must do to prevent the world from making inroads and causing us to become unfruitful.—Mark 4:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> “Run the Race With Endurance” is the theme of the second symposium. It will make clear how our life course is like a race. Why do we need to run according to the rules? How can we successfully put off every weight and not tire out in the race for life? The timely Scriptural counsel that will be provided will help all of us to continue running with endurance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Endurance Brings God’s Approval: </span><span class="font10">Talks delivered by the traveling overseers will prove faithstrengthening to those who listen and apply the counsel. One of the district overseer’s talks is entitled “Endurance Leads to an Approved Condition.” The public talk will answer the questions: In whose name should the nations hope, and what is involved in that? The concluding talk, “By Endurance You Will Acquire Your Souls,” will consider how Jesus was able to endure injustice without becoming embittered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Remember to bring your </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font10"> book and your </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> for the week. Take notes to help you concentrate and for future reference. A review of the program will be held later in the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah himself has prepared this banquet of spiritual food. Come! Eat! We will cry out joyfully if we are present to benefit from the entire program.—Isa. 65:14.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In many places, the field has come to include people from other lands. Many of these learn much more quickly and with deeper understanding when they are taught in their mother tongue. What arrangements are there to provide interested ones with Bible-based publications in the language they best understand?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> When to Offer Literature: </span><span class="font9">When two or more congregations speaking different languages work the same territory, the bodies of elders involved will work through the service overseers in setting up a mutually acceptable system so that each language group is given a thorough witness. When preaching from house to house, publishers would not normally offer literature in the language of the other congregation(s). However, when publishers witness informally or in public areas, they may offer literature in the languages of the community.—See the October 1990 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> Question Box.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> When to Stock Literature: </span><span class="font9">What can be done if there is a sizable foreign-language population in an area but no congregation speaking that particular language? Under those circumstances, congregations may stock a small quantity of the basic literature items that are available in that language, such as tracts, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Friend</span><span class="font9"> brochures, and</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">2. What cooperation is needed when two or more congregations speaking different languages work the same territory?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">3. When would a congregation stock foreign-language literature?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book. Publishers may offer this literature whenever they meet people who can read that language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> How to Order Literature: </span><span class="font9">If the congregation does not stock literature in the language that an interested person reads, how can literature in that language be obtained? The publisher should check with the literature servant to determine which publications are available in that language so that the needed items can be ordered with the congregation’s next literature request.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> If faster service is necessary, the publisher may ask a member of the Congregation Service Committee if the request may be submitted </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font9"> the congregation’s next scheduled literature request. If this is approved, the literature coordinator or someone designated by him can place a rush request through the mail or by telephone to the branch office. The literature will be shipped to the congregation’s regular delivery address or to a temporary delivery address, if desired. If overnight or two-day delivery is requested, the congregation will be billed for the delivery costs.</span></p></li>

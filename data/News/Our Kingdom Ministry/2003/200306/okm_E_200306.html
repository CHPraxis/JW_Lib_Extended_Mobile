<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Preaching in an Ever-Changing World</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">'How quickly things can change! Overnight, a natural disaster, an economic crisis, a political upheaval, or a highly publicized tragedy can become the topic of conversation. Just as quickly, however, people may turn their attention elsewhere. (Acts 17:21; 1 Cor. 7:31) In this ever-changing world, how can we capture people’s attention so as to share the Kingdom message with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Discern Others’ Concerns: </span><span class="font16">One way of capturing people’s attention is by referring to current events. In urging his listeners to think seriously about their standing with God, on one occasion Jesus mentioned recent tragedies that were on their minds. (Luke 13:1-5) In like manner, when presenting the good news, we do well to tie in a current news item or local issue that touches the lives of those in our territory. However, when discussing such matters, we must use caution not to take sides on political or social issues.—John 17:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> How can we tell what people are </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">currently</span><span class="font16"> thinking about? Perhaps the best way is simply to ask a question and then listen. (Matt. 12:34) Interest in people will move us to note the viewpoint of others and tactfully inquire further. An offhand remark by a householder may reveal a concern held by many in the area and could open the way to give a witness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Preparing a Presentation: </span><span class="font16">In preparing for held service in an ever-changing world, we can make use of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font16"> book. Helpful suggestions on how to incorporate current events into our presentation are set out on pages 1011, under “Crime/Safety” and “Current Events.” Similar information can be found in the September 2000 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font16"> page 4. When preparing your presentation, be sure to include an appropriate scripture.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> As we take note of the everchanging concerns of those in our territory, we need to adapt our presentation of the good news accordingly. In that way, we talk to people about what is close to their hearts. Thereby, we help many more come to know the One who is unchanging in his qualities and standards.—Jas. 1:17.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Christian Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">—Our Main Work</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> All of us have various kinds of work we must do. Providing for one’s household is a divine requirement. (1 Tim. 5:8) However, the work involved in that divine requirement should not overshadow the work of Kingdom preaching and disciple making.—Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Jesus provided a model for us to follow in “seeking first the kingdom.” (Matt. 6: 33; 1 Pet. 2:21) Though having little materially, he was fully absorbed in doing his Father’s will. (Luke 4:43; 9:58; John 4: 34) He exerted himself in giving a witness at every opportunity. (Luke 23:43; 1 Tim. 6: 13) He urged his disciples to have that same intense interest in the harvest work.—Matt. 9: 37, 38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Imitating Jesus Today: </span><span class="font16">We can imitate Jesus’ example by striving to live a simple life that centers on the Christian ministry. If we have the necessities of life, let us heed the Bible’s counsel not to go on acquiring more and more of this world’s goods. (Matt. 6:19, 20; 1 Tim. 6:8) How much better to seek to expand our share in the preaching work! If we face challenging circumstances, may we exert ourselves as Jesus did, not allowing the cares of life to overshadow our main work of declaring the good news of the Kingdom. —Luke 8:14; 9:59-62.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> Even those with many responsibilities give priority to the preaching work. A brother who has a large family, holds a responsible job, and serves as an elder in the Christian congregation says: “I view the ministry as my career.” A pioneer sister says: “Pioneering is worth far more than a successful secular career.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> Regardless of our circumstances, may we follow Jesus’ example. How? By making the Christian ministry our main work.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> Like Jesus and many other faithful servants of old, the apostle Paul was a zealous preacher of the good news, “bearing thorough witness” regardless of the setting. Even while under house arrest, he “would kindly receive all those who came in to him, preaching the kingdom of God to them and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with the greatest freeness of speech.”—Acts 28:16-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> We too can be diligent in “bearing thorough witness” at all times. That includes witnessing to people we meet in our travels to and from the “Give God Glory” District Convention and while in the host city.—Acts 28:23; Ps. 145:10-13.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Incidental or Informal Witnessing? </span><span class="font16">Is there a difference? Yes. Something that is </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">incidental</span><span class="font16"> occurs merely by chance or without intention, as if it was not planned or is of little importance. That certainly does not describe our ministry. As was true of Paul, giving God glory by our witnessing is important to us, and it should be our intention to give a witness wherever appropriate in the course of our travels this summer. However, the manner in which we approach others can rightly be described as </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">informal—</span><span class="font16">that is, relaxed, friendly, and unofficial. This approach can produce good results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Prepare to Give a Witness: </span><span class="font16">Paul had to make opportunities to witness while under house arrest in Rome. From his place of lodging, he took the initiative to invite the local Jewish leaders to his house. (Acts 28:17) Even 1, 2. What impresses you about Paul’s view of preaching the good news, and how can we imitate his example of “bearing thorough witness”?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16">3. How can we avoid having our informal witnessing turn into only an incidental effort?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">4. What enabled Paul to witness at his place of lodging?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">though there was a Christian congregation in Rome, Paul learned that the Jewish community in that city had little firsthand information about the Christian faith. (Acts 28:22; Rom. 1:7) He did not hold back from “bearing thorough witness” about Jesus Christ and the Kingdom of God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> Think of all the people you may contact in your travels who have only a passing knowledge of Jehovah’s Witnesses. They may not even know that we offer free home Bible studies. Be alert to opportunities to witness to those you meet while traveling, making rest stops, refueling, shopping, staying in hotels, eating in restaurants, using public transportation, and so on. Determine in advance what you might say to initiate a conversation and to give a brief witness. Perhaps in the days ahead you can practice by witnessing informally to your neighbors, relatives, workmates, and other acquaintances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> You will need a supply of publications to use when</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">witnessing informally. Which ones? You might use the tract </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</span><span class="font16"> Point to the first five paragraphs, where various reasons are given for reading the Bible. Show the coupon on the back for requesting a free home Bible study. When you find a responsive person, offer the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font16"> brochure. In anticipation of meeting people who speak another language, take along the booklet </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Good News for All Nations. </span><span class="font16">Page 2 explains how to use it to give a witness. If traveling by car, you may be able to take along a few other basic publications for those who show real interest in the Kingdom message.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Consider Your Appearance and Conduct: </span><span class="font16">We must make sure that our conduct as well as our dress and grooming will not give others a wrong impression or cause them to ‘speak against’ Jehovah’s organization. (Acts 28:22) This applies not only while attending the convention but also while traveling and during leisure time. The August 1, 2002, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font16"> page 18, paragraph 14, cautioned: “Our appearance should not be showy, bizarre, provocative, revealing, or faddish. In addition, we should dress in a manner that reflects ‘reverence for God.’ That gives food for thought, does it not? It is not simply a matter of dressing appropriately when attending congregation meetings [or convention sessions] and then throwing all caution to the wind at other times. Our personal appearance should always reflect a reverent, honorable attitude because we are Christians and ministers 24 hours a day.” —1 Tim. 2:9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>8</sup> We should dress modestly and with dignity. If our appearance and conduct always reflect our belief in God, we will never feel obligated to hold back from witnessing informally because our personal appearance leaves something to be desired.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Informal Witnessing Is Fruitful: </span><span class="font16">During the two years that Paul was under house arrest in Rome, he saw good results from his witnessing efforts.

<p><span class="font2">Forget whom? All the interested ones who attended the Memorial of Christ’s death or the special talk. Have we invited them to attend this year’s district convention? Likely many of them, if given kindly encouragement, would attend. As they enjoy the upbuilding association at the convention and the encouraging spiritual program, they will be drawn closer to Jehovah and to his organization. Why not extend an invitation and see what happens? Give them all the details they need, including the dates of the convention, directions to the convention site, the times for the sessions to begin and end, and the preview of the program that is outlined on the back cover of the June 8, 2003, issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>10</sup> Last summer, after spending the day at the district convention, a couple had a fruitful experience witnessing informally to a waitress who asked them about their convention badge cards. They told her about the convention and also about the hope the Bible holds out for the future of mankind. They gave her the tract </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</span><span class="font16"> and explained the free home Bible study arrangement. The woman said that she wanted someone to visit her, filled in her name and address on the back of the tract, and asked the couple to make the arrangements. What success might you enjoy this year by being diligent in “bearing thorough witness”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Thoroughly Advance the Good News: </span><span class="font16">Imagine how happy Paul was when he heard that fellow Christians were imitating his zealous example!

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Retirement—A Door to Increased Activity?</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> Many hardworking people long for the time when retirement will free them from the toil and pressures of secular work. All too often, though, retirement results in apathy, boredom, and premature aging. The lack of purposeful activity can leave the mind preoccupied with worry over self. A Brazilian newspaper reported that retired public employees complained of problems ranging from ‘dissatisfaction, irritability, insecurity, and loss of identity to depression and the feeling that their world was falling apart.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> In contrast, many Christians view this new chapter in their life as a door to increased spiritual activity. One brother who began pioneering two weeks after reaching the age of 65 said: “I have never experienced a period in my life so richly filled with blessings as the past ten years of pioneering.” A couple wrote: “Our real golden years began when we started pioneering.” Yes, for many, retirement offers a golden opportunity to expand their ministry and reap rich blessings from Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Keeping Busy and Productive: </span><span class="font16">Many who are now retired grew up without the conveniences that are common today and learned to work hard from an early age. Although they may no longer have the vigor of youth, they are still very productive workers. In one branch territory, 22 percent of the pioneers—some 20,000 brothers and sisters—are at least 60 years of age. These older ones make a major contribution to the preaching work. Their experience and godly qualities enrich the congregations with which they serve.—Jas. 3:17, 18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> Keeping busy in the Christian ministry contributes to better health and an improved quality of life. An 84-year-old sister who started pioneering when she retired said: “Having many Bible studies with interested people has helped me to stay mentally active. I don’t have a car, so I walk a lot. That keeps me healthy.” An elderly pioneer couple commented: “The service keeps us fit mentally and physically. We are always together. We laugh a lot and enjoy life.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Serving Where There Is a Need: </span><span class="font16">Some retired Christians who have favorable financial circumstances have moved to serve where the need for Kingdom preachers is greater. Others have expanded their ministry to serve in a foreign-language field. Like the apostle Paul, these zealous publishers “do all things for the sake of the good news, that [they] may become a sharer of it with others.”—1 Cor. 9:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> One couple started pioneering after raising their two sons. After several years of pioneering, they undertook the task of learning the Chinese language. Now well into their 70’s, they recently had the joy of seeing the Chinese group that they have been working with become a congregation. What a blessing couples like these have proved to be!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> No Retirement From the Ministry: </span><span class="font16">While most people eventually retire from their secular employment, there is no retirement for any Christian from God’s service. All must continue faithful “to the end.” (Matt. 24:13, 14) Of course, with advancing years, some are not able to do as much as they formerly did in Jehovah’s service. But how encouraging it is to see them doing what they can in a wholehearted way! God’s Word assures them that Jehovah will not forget their work and the love that they show for his name. —Luke 21:1-4; Heb. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>8</sup> If you are approaching retirement age, why not prayerfully consider how you can make full use of your changing circumstances? With divine help, you may find that retirement opens for you a door to increased activity that brings praise to Jehovah and many blessings.—Ps. 148:12,13.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Disabled—Yet Fruitful</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> If you are among the many Witnesses of Jehovah who have a disability, you can still have a fruitful ministry. In fact, your circumstances may provide special opportunities for you to give a witness and encourage others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Giving a Witness: </span><span class="font16">Many who must contend with a disability are having a full share in the ministry. For example, one sister whose mobility and speech were seriously affected by an operation found that she could share in magazine work if her husband parked their car near a busy sidewalk. On one occasion, she placed 80 magazines in just two hours! Your special circumstances may also bring you into contact with people who are otherwise hard to reach. If so, view them as your special territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Your preaching can be very effective! As others observe your determination and the good effect that Bible truth has had on your life, they may be attracted to the Kingdom message. Moreover, when you meet people who are suffering adversity, your experience in life may equip you to provide them with comfort from God’s Word.—2 Cor. 1:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Strengthen Others: </span><span class="font16">Were you not encouraged by the life story of Laurel Nisbet, who was confined to an iron lung for 37 years yet helped 17 individuals to come to an accurate knowledge of Bible truth? In like manner, your example can inspire fellow believers to exert themselves in Jehovah’s service.—p93 1/22 pp. 18-21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> Even if your circumstances prevent you from getting out in the ministry as much as you would like, you can still strengthen others. One brother said: “I have learned that even a severely disabled person can be of great service to others. My wife and I have been a sort of anchor for various ones in the congregation. Because of our circumstances we are always here, always available.” However, because of your disability, it is understood that you may not always be able to perform in accord with your zeal. Still, with some help you may be able to have an active share in the ministry. Therefore, if you require some assistance, do not hesitate to bring this to the attention of the elders or others in the congregation who can assist you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah sees everything you do in order to serve him, and he takes delight in your whole-souled service. (Ps. 139:1-4) As you rely on him, he can empower you to have a fruitful and meaningful ministry.—2 Cor. 12:7-10.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Making Known the Divine Name</span></h4>
<div>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> How did you respond when you first learned God’s name? The reaction of many is similar to that of a woman who said: “When I first saw God’s name in the Bible, I wept. I was so moved by the knowledge that I could actually know and use the personal name of God.” For her, learning the divine name was an important step in getting to know Jehovah as a person and being able to build a relationship with him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Why Make It Known? </span><span class="font16">God’s name is linked with his qualities, purposes, and acts. It is also linked with salvation. “Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved,” wrote the apostle Paul. But “how will they call on him,” Paul reasoned, unless people first learn about Jehovah and exercise faith in him? Hence, it is urgent for Christians to make known to others God’s name and all that it represents. (Rom. 10:13, 14) However, there is an even greater reason why the divine name must be made known.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> In the 1920’s, God’s people discerned from the Scriptures the universal issue involving the vindication of God’s sovereignty and the sanctification of his name. Before Jehovah destroys the wicked to remove the reproach that has been heaped upon his name, the truth about him must be “made known in all the earth.” (Isa. 12:4, 5; Ezek. 38: 23) Therefore, our foremost reason for preaching is to praise Jehovah publicly and to sancti-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font16">1. What effect can learning God’s personal name have on people?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">2. Why is it urgent for us to teach others about Jehovah?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">3. What is our foremost reason for preaching? fy his name before all mankind. (Heb. 13:15) Love for God and neighbor will move us to share fully in this God-ordained work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> “A People for His Name”: </span><span class="font16">In 1931 we adopted the name Jehovah’s Witnesses. (Isa. 43:10) Since then, God’s people have made known the divine name to such an extent that the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Pro-claimers</span><span class="font16"> book, page 124, notes: “Internationally, anyone who freely uses the name Jehovah is quickly identified as being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Are you thus identified? Gratitude for Jehovah’s goodness should move us to ‘bless his name,’ speaking about him on every appropriate occasion.—Ps. 20:7; 145:1, 2, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> As “a people for his name,” we must uphold his standards. (Acts 15:14; 2 Tim. 2:19) Often what people first notice about Jehovah’s Witnesses is their fine conduct. (1 Pet. 2:12) Never would we want to profane his name by flouting godly principles or by relegating his worship to a secondary place in our lives. (Lev. 22:31, 32; Mal. 1:6-8, 12-14) Rather, may our way of life show that we cherish the privilege of bearing the divine name.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> Today, we see being fulfilled Jehovah’s declaration: “From the sun’s rising even to its setting my name will be great among the nations.” (Mal. 1:11) Let us continue to make known the truth about Jehovah and “bless his holy name to time indefinite, even forever.”—Ps. 145:21.</span></p></li></ul>

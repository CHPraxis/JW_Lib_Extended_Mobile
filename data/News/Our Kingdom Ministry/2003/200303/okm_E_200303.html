<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Jehovah Is Very Much to Be Praised The Lord’s Evening Meal to Be Observed on April 16</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Anticipation mounts as we approach April 16, 2003. On that night we will commemorate Jesus’ death, joining millions of fellow worshipers worldwide in glorifying Jehovah’s name. Jehovah deserves all our praise for the wonderful provision of the ransom. By means of it, he will bestow marvelous blessings on all obedient mankind. Wholeheartedly we join with the psalmist in crying out: “Jehovah is great and very much to be praised.”—Ps. 145:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> This is a time for meditating on God’s goodness and the debt of gratitude we owe Jehovah for sending “his only-begotten Son into the world that we might gain life through him.” (1 John 4: 9, 10) Obediently observing the Lord’s Evening Meal impresses upon our hearts that “Jehovah is gracious and merciful . . . and great in loving-kindness.” (Ps. 145:8) Indeed, the ransom is Jehovah’s greatest expression of love toward all mankind. (John 3:16) When we reflect on God’s love and contemplate Jesus’ faithful course of integrity, we are moved to praise Jehovah. Throughout eternity, we will praise him for his unbounded love expressed in making everlasting life possible for us.—Ps. 145:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Help Others to Praise Jehovah: </span><span class="font10">Appreciation for God’s superlative gift of the ransom moves us to invite others to join us in praising Jehovah. The psalmist was inspired to write: “With the mention of the abundance of your goodness they will bubble over, and because of your righteousness they will cry out joyfully.” (Ps. 145:7) Last year alone, Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide devoted more than a billion hours to the preaching work. What resulted from their efforts? Each week, an average of more than 5,100 individuals were baptized in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah. With a total of 15,597,746 in attendance at the Memorial, including over 9 million who have not yet begun to praise Jehovah as publishers of the good news, there is great potential for further increase! As Kingdom proclaimed, we cherish our privilege of declaring the good news and turning the hearts of others toward Jehovah, his Son, and the Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> A fine way to encourage others to honor Jehovah is by inviting them to join us in observing the Lord’s Evening Meal. Have you made a list of all those you want to invite as well as others who may need to be reminded of the day and hour? Have you offered an invitation to all those on your list? If not, diligently follow through in the time remaining. Help them appreciate the purpose of the celebration. At the observance, be alert to greet visitors. Make them feel welcome, introduce them to others, and commend them for being present.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Attending the Memorial can stimulate new ones to make spiritual progress. A Bible student who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, which makes it very difficult for him to go out in public, came to the Memorial. When asked what he thought of the meeting, he said: “It was a most holy night, and I was there.” Since then, he has started attending meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> After the Memorial: </span><span class="font10">What can be done to help these interested ones to become praisers of Jehovah? The elders will take note of the new ones who attend the Memorial and make arrangements for qualified publishers to visit them soon afterward to review the refreshing things they learned and observed. Some may wish to have a home Bible study. They should also be invited to attend all the weekly congregation meetings, since regular attendance can increase their Bible knowledge.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Arrangements are being made to encourage all irregular and inactive ones to attend meetings regularly. If you are asked by the elders to assist someone who has become inactive to resume sharing in field service, be ready to respond. Showing such loving concern for our brothers is in harmony with the apostle Paul’s exhortation: “As long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.”—Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> May all of us make a special effort to be at the Memorial on April 16. We would not want to miss this most sacred occasion to praise Jehovah. Yes, now and forever, let us praise Jehovah for his great works!—Ps. 145:21.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Be Zealous for What Is Good!</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As we enter the 2003 Memorial season, we have abundant reasons to be “zealous for what is good.” (1 Pet. 3:13) Foremost among these is the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ. (Matt. 20:28; John 3:16) Concerning this, the apostle Peter wrote: “It was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that you were delivered from your fruitless form of conduct. . . . But it was with precious blood, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, even Christ’s.” (1 Pet. 1:18,19) Gratitude for this extraordinary expression of love compels us to busy ourselves in the doing of good, recognizing that Jesus “gave himself for us that he might deliver us from every sort of lawlessness and cleanse for himself a people peculiarly his own, zealous for fine works.”—Titus 2: 14; 2 Cor. 5:14, 15.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font11">1999 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14,088,751</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">2000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14,872,086</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> When we do what is pleasing in God’s eyes, we enjoy a good relationship with him and come under his loving watchcare. Peter further stated: “He that would love life and see good days,... let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good; let him seek peace and pursue it. For the eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous ones, and his ears are toward their supplication.” (1 Pet. 3:10-12) In these perilous times, what a blessing it is to know that Jehovah is keeping watch over us and is ready to act in our behalf, “to safeguard [us] as the pupil of his eye.”—Deut. 32:10; 2 Chron. 16:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Despite facing trials, the early Christians to whom Peter wrote were fired with zeal that could not be quenched, and they gave the good news the widest possible proclamation. (1 Pet. 1:6; 4:12) The same is true of God’s people today. Although we live in “critical times hard to deal with,” appreciation for Jehovah’s goodness moves us to do God’s will zealously. (2 Tim. 3:1; Ps. 145:7) Let us consider some of the good works with which we will busy ourselves during this Memorial season.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Invite Others to the Memorial: </span><span class="font12">One way we can show our appreciation for the extraordinary gift of the ransom is to be present for the annual commemoration of Jesus’ death, which will be observed this year on Wednesday, April 16, after sundown. (Luke 22:19, 20) Last year, with 94,600 congregations reporting worldwide, we had a grand total attendance of 15,597,746! That was over 220,000 more than attended the year before.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> How many will attend this year? Much will depend on our diligent efforts to encourage others to assemble with us. Start by making a list of all those you would like to invite. At the top of the list should be your immediate family. If you have an unbelieving mate, express your heartfelt desire that</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">he or she attend with you. One unbelieving husband said that he attended the Memorial last year because he could see how much his presence meant to his wife. Next on your list could be relatives, neighbors, workmates, or schoolmates. Be certain to invite your Bible students.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> After making your list, schedule time to extend a personal invitation to each one. Use the printed Memorial invitations. To help people remember when and where the observance will be held, type or neatly print the time and location of the Memorial at the bottom of the invitation. As April 16 draws near, give those on your list a reminder, either in person or by telephone. Let us help as many as possible to be present for this most sacred occasion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Assist Those Who Attend the Memorial: </span><span class="font12">The night of the Memorial is always an exciting occasion. We have the opportunity to welcome individuals who do not normally attend our meetings. Make arrangements to arrive early and stay late, as local circumstances allow. Take the initiative to get acquainted with the new ones in attendance. Be warm and hospitable. —Rom. 12:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Could some who attend the Memorial be helped to make greater spiritual progress through a home Bible study? Endeavor to obtain names and addresses of any visitors who are not currently being called on so that you can follow through. With loving assistance, some of these may progress to the point of qualifying as unbaptized publishers before next year’s Memorial. When making follow-up visits on Memorial attend-ers, extend an invitation to the special talk to be given on April 27.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Who Will You Invite to the Memorial?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">□ Immediate family and relatives</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">□ Neighbors and acquaintances</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">□ Workmates and schoolmates</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">□ Return visits and Bible students</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Can You Auxiliary Pioneer This Spring? </span><span class="font12">Each year our zeal for Jehovah moves us to exert ourselves fully in the ministry during the months of special theocratic activity. The unified efforts of an entire congregation to preach the good news zealously during the Memorial season can produce fine results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> One congregation of 107 publishers and 9 regular pioneers reported that they had a “phenomenal month” last April, with 53 serving as auxiliary pioneers, including all the elders and ministerial servants. How did the elders build enthusiasm for auxiliary pioneering that month? They started early, encouraging as many as possible to enroll. Meetings for field service were held at various times during the day to accommodate all in the congregation. Special emphasis was given to telephone witnessing, especially for the infirm.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> One 86-year-old sister, who is unable to walk because of health problems, signed up to auxiliary pioneer. Starting in the morning, she would do a couple of hours of telephone witnessing while sitting at the kitchen table, rest for a few hours, and then come back and do some more. One person she contacted had lost her husband and two teenage sons in death during the past two years and could not understand why God permits such evil things to happen. A good witness was given, and a Bible study was started. Telephone witnessing in the evenings and at other times is an effective way to contact people who live in buildings or areas that are inaccessible. It also enables publishers to contact people who are not at home during the day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> The elders concluded their report by saying: “We had such a wonderful time and appreciate the privileges and blessings Jehovah has made possible for each of us.” With proper planning, your congregation too can enjoy such blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Strive for 1OO-Percent Participation in the Ministry: </span><span class="font12">Our love for God and neighbor moves us to buy out time each month to share the good news with others. (Matt. 22:37-39) Congregation Book Study overseers and their assistants should endeavor to assist those in their group to share in the ministry each month. A fine way to do this is by making arrangements in advance to work in the ministry with specific individuals in the group. Rather than waiting until the end of the month to do this, start early. This will give you more opportunities to provide loving assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>14</sup> Are there infirm publishers in your book study group who have great difficulty sharing in the ministry? If some are in residential care facilities or are confined to their homes, it is understandable that their opportunities to witness will be limited. But by taking advantage of their limited opportunities to let their light shine, they may move those who see their fine works to take a real interest in the truth. (Matt. 5:16) Book study overseers should be sure that such ones know that they can report field service activity in increments of 15 minutes. Being able to report the time they spend witnessing encourages these faithful publishers, and it brings them joyful satisfaction. It also helps to ensure that the worldwide report of the activities of God’s people is accurate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> Youths Who Are Busy Doing What Is Good! </span><span class="font12">How refreshing it is to see Christian youths use their strength and energy in the service of Jehovah! (Prov. 20:29) If you are young, how can you demonstrate your zeal for Jehovah during these special months of activity?</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Assist Those Who Attend the Memorial</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">□ Extend a warm welcome □ Make follow-up visits</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">□ Offer them a Bible study □ Invite them to the special talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>16</sup> If you are not yet an unbaptized publisher in the congregation, can you reach out for that privilege? Ask yourself the following questions: ‘Do I have a basic knowledge of Bible truth? Do I </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font12"> to share in Kingdom service? Am I exemplary in my conduct? Am I able to make a personal expression of my faith by speaking to others about the good news? Am I moved from my heart to do so?’ If you can answer yes to those questions, then speak to your parents about your desire to become a publisher. Your parents can approach one of the elders on the service committee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>17</sup> If you are already a publisher of the good news, can you take advantage of time off from school to expand your share in the ministry? With a good schedule and assistance from parents and others, many baptized youths have been able to auxiliary pioneer. If that is not possible, then be determined to increase your share in the field ministry. Set a goal for yourself. In addition to an hour goal, set another goal related to the quality of your ministry. Perhaps you can strive to share a scripture at each door, improve the quality of your return visits, start a Bible study, or expand your ministry to include telephone witnessing or some other feature of the service. What about the goal of having a neighbor, schoolmate, or relative accompany you to the Memorial this year? Having a full share in theocratic activities will be rewarding and will surely encourage others in the congregation.—1 Thess. 5:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> Help New Ones Progress: </span><span class="font12">During the past service year, an average of over 463,000 home Bible studies were conducted each month in the United States. In time, many of these students will progress to the point of dedication and baptism. However, before they reach that goal, we need to help them to qualify as publishers of the good news. This is an important step in teaching new ones to be followers of Jesus Christ. (Matt. 9:9; Luke 6:40) Do you have a Bible student who is ready to take that step?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>19</sup> If you are unsure of your student’s progress, seek the assistance of your book study overseer or the service overseer. Perhaps you can invite him to sit in on the study. These brothers have valuable experience that can be drawn upon to evaluate the student’s spiritual progress. They may have suggestions that will help the student to continue growing spiritually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>20</sup> When your student expresses an interest in becoming an unbaptized publisher and you feel that he qualifies, speak with the presiding overseer. He will arrange to have two elders meet with you and the student to consider whether he qualifies, using the information on pages 98-9 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font12"> book. (See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font12">November 15,1988, page 17.) If the student is approved to be a publisher, you should begin his training right away. Once he turns in a field service report, the congregation will be informed that the student is an unbaptized publisher. It is our hope that thousands of new publishers, both young and old, can reach this important milestone during these special months of activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> Planning Helps to Accomplish the Most Good: </span><span class="font12">Advance planning will contribute to the success of our theocratic activities during this Memorial season. (Prov. 21:5) There are many matters that need attention on the part of the elders.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What Are Your Goals for the Memorial Season?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">□ Have someone you invited attend the Memorial</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">□ Qualify as a publisher of the good news</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">□ Spend a certain number of hours in the ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">□ Improve in a certain feature of the ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">□ Serve as an auxiliary pioneer</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>22</sup> To help the congregation accomplish the most in the field ministry, elders should make practical arrangements to hold meetings for field service throughout the week and on the weekend. The service overseer should take the lead in making these arrangements. Could additional meetings be arranged for early morning, late afternoon, or early evening? The congregation should be informed of the arrangements. It may be helpful if the schedule is posted on the information board.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>23</sup> The elders should see to it that arrangements for the Memorial are in place well in advance of April 16. These include coordinating the use of the Kingdom Hall with other congregations that may meet there, cleaning the Kingdom Hall, selecting attendants and servers, and obtaining the emblems. The congregation should be informed of the time and location of the Memorial and of any adjustments in the meeting schedule for the week. Diligently caring for these things will allow the observance to “take place decently and by arrangement.”—1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>24</sup> Family heads may want to use part of their family study to discuss how the family can share in the increased activity during the Memorial season. Can your entire family auxiliary pioneer? Or could the family support one or more members in doing so? If that is not possible, set specific goals as a family to spend more time in the ministry. Is there a younger member of the family who, with a little encouragement and assistance, could qualify as an unbaptized publisher? How many can your family invite to the Memorial this year?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Good planning will bring many blessings and joys to your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> Take Full Advantage of Time Remaining: </span><span class="font12">In writing to the first-century Christians, the apostle Peter reminded them of the urgency of the times because the end of the Jewish system of things had drawn close. (1 Pet. 4:7) Today all the evidence indicates that the end of the present global system of things is at hand. Day by day, our pattern of life should reflect that conviction. As zealous servants of Jehovah, we should be focused on the urgent work of declaring the good news. —Titus 2:13, 14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>26</sup> Now is a time for zeal and action! Meditate on what Jehovah has done for you, your family, and the congregation. Although we can never repay him for the many ways he has benefited us, we can give Jehovah whole-souled worship. (Ps. 116:12-14) Our diligent efforts will be rewarded with blessings from on high. (Prov. 10:22) May we all be “zealous for what is good” during this special time of increased activity, “so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.”—! Pet. 3:13; 4:11.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Reminders</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">The Memorial observance this year falls on Wednesday, April 16. The elders should give attention to the following matters:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">■ In setting the time for the meeting, make sure that the emblems will not be passed until after sundown.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ Everyone, including the speaker, should be informed of the exact time and location of the observance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ The appropriate type of bread and wine should be obtained and made ready.—See the February 15, 1985, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> page 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ Plates, glasses, and a suitable table and tablecloth should be brought to the hall and set up in advance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ The Kingdom Hall or other in their application early. This will help the elders to make necessary field service arrangements and have sufficient magazines and other literature on hand. The names of all who are approved to auxiliary pioneer should be announced to the congregation each month.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ The branch office does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">each month </span><span class="font10">before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the branch so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ It is important that groups of 20 or more persons planning to visit the branch office facilities first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">meeting place should be thoroughly cleaned ahead of time. ■ Attendants and servers should be selected and instructed in advance about their duties, the proper procedure to be followed, and the need for dignified dress and grooming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ Arrangements should be made to serve any of the anointed who are infirm and are thus unable to be present. ■ When more than one congregation is scheduled to use the same Kingdom Hall, there should be good coordination among congregations so as to avoid unnecessary congestion in the lobby or entryway, on the public sidewalks, and in the parking lot. Where possible, it is good to allow 45 minutes between observances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">NY 12563-9204. The Central Tour Desk will care for groups that will be visiting the branch office facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, or the Assembly Hall at Jersey City, New Jersey. Please send information on the number coming and the dates and times for visiting each location. The branch office will provide a description of the tours that are available as well as a map giving directions to each location. LODGING INFORMATION HAS BEEN SENT TO THE CONGREGATION ELDERS AND MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE CONGREGATION SECRETARY. Before your visit, please review the June 2002 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> Question Box regarding proper dress and grooming when visiting Bethel homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ A packet of legal material is available to assist publishers who are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation matters in which our religion is under attack. The packet should be requested by the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">body of elders only </span><span class="font10">in a case in which it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue. For those facing secular issues on child custody or visitation, helpful information can be found in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> of December 8, 1997, pages 3-12; in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">of October 22, 1988, pages 2-14; and on the chart found in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">of April 22, 1991, page 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ The secretary should see that the Regional Building Committee is kept up-to-date on the status of all baptized publishers who have submitted Kingdom Hall Volunteer Worker Questionnaire (S-82) forms. When there are adjustments in a volunteer’s status, such as when one moves or is appointed as a ministerial servant or an elder, new forms should be filled out promptly and submitted. If a volunteer’s mailing address or telephone number changes or if he is no longer in good standing in the congregation, the elders should immediately inform the Regional Building Committee by letter.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How the Truth Sets Us Free</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> On a certain occasion, Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (John 8:32) He was speaking of a freedom that surpasses mere civil liberties, a freedom that is available to all—rich or poor, educated or uneducated. Jesus taught truth that would bring freedom from bondage to sin and death. As Jesus explained, “every doer of sin is a slave of sin.” (John 8:34) How we do long for the time when all obedient humans “will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God”! —Rom. 8:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The truth regarding Jesus and his role in the outworking of God’s purpose brings such freedom. It includes knowledge about the ransom sacrifice that he gave in our behalf. (Rom. 3:24) Even now, accepting and obediently submitting to Bible truth enables us to enjoy a measure of freedom from fear, despair, and all sorts of harmful practices.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Freedom From Fear and Despair: </span><span class="font10">We need not despair over world conditions because we understand why wickedness exists and we know that it will soon be wiped off the earth. (Ps. 37:10, 11; 2 Tim. 3:1; Rev. 12:12) Furthermore, the truth frees us from false teachings about the condition of the dead. We know that the dead cannot harm us, that they are not suffering eternal torment, and that God does not take people in death just to have them with him in the spirit realm.—Eccl. 9:5; Acts 24:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Such truth sustained a father and a mother when their child was killed in an accident. “There is a void in our lives that cannot be filled until we see our son again by means of the resurrection,” said the mother. “But we know our pain is only temporary.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Freedom From Harmful Practices: </span><span class="font10">Bible truth can transform a person’s thinking and personality, resulting in freedom from avoidable problems. (Eph. 4:20-24) Practicing honesty and industriousness can help alleviate poverty. (Prov. 13:4) Showing selfsacrificing love improves relationships with others. (Col. 3:13, 14) Respecting Christian headship minimizes family difficulties. (Eph. 5:33-6:1) Avoiding drunkenness, sexual immorality, tobacco, and addictive drugs promotes good health.—Prov. 7: 21-23; 23:29, 30; 2 Cor. 7:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> A young man had been unable to break a nine-year addiction to drugs. One day he met a publisher engaged in street witnessing. He accepted literature, and arrangements were made to call on him at his home. A Bible study was started. Two months later the man stopped using drugs altogether, and after eight months of study, he was baptized. Seeing him break free from his addiction prompted his brother and sister-in-law to start studying the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Help Others Gain Freedom: </span><span class="font10">Those who have been lifelong captives to false teachings may find it difficult to comprehend the freedom offered by God’s Word. Reaching their hearts may require special diligence and good preparation on the part of the teacher. (2 Tim. 4: 2,5) This is no time to slow down in our work of ‘proclaiming liberty to those taken captive.’ (Isa. 61:1) Christian freedom is precious, for it leads to everlasting life.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>

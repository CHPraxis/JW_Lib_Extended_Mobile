<p><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">December 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 12/03 Vol. 46, No. 12</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">True Christian Unity—How?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> What could unite over six million people from 234 lands and some 380 language groups? Only the worship of Jehovah God. (Mic. 2:12; 4:1-3) Jehovah’s Witnesses know from personal experience that true Christian unity is a reality today. As “one flock” under our “one shepherd,” we are determined to resist this world’s divisive spirit.—John 10:16; Eph. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> God’s unfailing purpose is that all intelligent creation be united in true worship. (Rev. 5:13) Knowing the importance of this, Jesus made the unity of his followers a matter of earnest prayer. (John 17:20, 21) How can each of us contribute to the unity of the Christian congregation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How Unity Is Achieved: </span><span class="font1">Without God’s Word and spirit, Christian unity would be unattainable. Our applying what we read in the Bible allows God’s spirit to flow freely in our lives. This enables us “to observe the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace.” (Eph. 4:3) It impels us to put up with one another in love. (Col. 3:13, 14; 1 Pet. 4:8) Do you promote unity by meditating on God’s Word each day?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Our commission to preach and make disciples also unites us. When we work with others in the Christian ministry, “striving side by side for the faith of the good news,” we become “fellow workers in the truth.” (Phil. 1:27; 3 John 8) As we do so, the uniting bonds of love within the congregation are strengthened. Why not invite someone you have not recently worked with to accompany you in the field ministry this week?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> How privileged we are to be part of the only true international brotherhood on earth today! (1 Pet. 5:9) Recently, thousands experienced this global unity firsthand at the “Give God Glory” International Conventions. May each of us contribute to this precious unity by reading God’s Word each day, by resolving differences in love, and by preaching the good news “with one accord.”—Rom. 15:6.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Searching Out Deserving Ones</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Jesus’ instructions for carrying out the preaching work present us with a challenge. He said: “Into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving.” (Matt. 10: 11) With people today spending less and less time at home, how can we conduct this search effectively?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Analyze Your Territory: </span><span class="font1">Begin by analyzing your territory. When are people most likely to be at home? Where can they be found during the day? Is there a certain day of the week or time of day when they might be more receptive to a visit? Adjusting your ministry to the routine and circumstances of people in the local territory can help you to accomplish the most good. —1 Cor. 9:23, 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Many publishers have found success during the early evening hours. Some householders are more relaxed and inclined to listen at that time. When daylight hours are few during the winter months, telephone witnessing (where allowed) in the evenings may prove effective. Working business territory and witnessing in public areas are also ways to reach people with the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> During a month of special activity, one congregation instituted late-afternoon witnessing on Saturdays and Sundays and evening witnessing on Wednesdays and Fridays. They also organized telephone witnessing and arranged to work business territory. These arrangements generated so much enthusiasm for the ministry that the congregation decided to continue them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Follow Up Diligently: </span><span class="font1">If it is challenging in your territory to find people at home when you call back, try to make a specific appointment to call again at the conclusion of each visit, including the initial call. Then, be sure to keep the appointment. (Matt. 5:37) If appropriate, you might ask for the householder’s telephone number. This can also help you to contact the person again.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Our diligent efforts to search out deserving ones and follow up on the interest we find will surely have Jehovah’s blessing.—Prov. 21:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> What makes our annual district conventions special for you? Upbuilding talks and a drama prepared for us by “the faithful and discreet slave”? (Matt. 24:4547) New publications containing timely spiritual nourishment? Brothers and sisters presenting their experiences of how the Bible has changed their lives for the better? Reports of how the Kingdompreaching work is progressing in other lands? Association with fellow believers of all ages? Yes, we look forward to our conventions with keen anticipation for these and many other reasons!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Attend All Three Days: </span><span class="font2">Through Moses, Jehovah commanded: “Congregate the people ... in order that they may listen and in order that they may learn.” (Deut. 31:12) Through the faithful and discreet slave class, Jehovah has prepared a special program of education for us on each day of our convention. Since he is teaching us to ‘benefit ourselves,’ we want to be present for all of his instruction. (Isa. 48: 17) If you need to request time off from your employer, pray to Jehovah and make your request, following Nehemiah’s courageous example. (Neh. 1:11; 2:4) Also, it would be loving to inform unbelieving family members of your convention plans as soon as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Accommodations: </span><span class="font2">For your convenience, rooming arrangements have already been made in each convention city. A Recommended Lodging List of available hotels will be posted on your congregation’s information board after this insert is considered at the Service Meeting. The local brothers assisting the branch office are able to arrange these reduced hotel rates because of your fine cooperation. Therefore, please reserve rooms only at hotels on the list, and agree to pay only the rates shown. This will help toward the goal of obtaining high-quality hotels near the convention site at the best rates possible each year. Hotels slightly farther from the convention site are also very good. Before you call to make your reservation, review the points in the box “How You Can Support the Rooming Arrangements,” on page 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Special Needs: </span><span class="font2">The apostle Paul reminded the congregations in Galatia to “work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to [them] in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) Elderly brothers and sisters, the infirm, single parents, or those in full-time service may not ask for your help, but they may have challenges to overcome in order to attend the convention. Are you in a position to “work what is good” toward them and offer some assistance? Christian relatives and the elders should particularly be aware of the circumstances of such ones.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> If a Special Needs Room Request form is submitted by a publisher, the Congregation Service Committee will review it, using the guidelines on the form.

<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>How You Can Support the Rooming Arrangements</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">■ Stay only in hotels on this year’s Recommended Lodging List. Do not call hotels that are not on the list and ask if they have a rate for our convention. Hotels that are not on the list will often say they have a rate for Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ To comply with fire safety laws, plan on a maximum of four persons in each room, including children, unless the list indicates otherwise under the heading “Adults.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ If no rooms are available after calling all the hotels on the list or if you have a problem with a hotel, inform your congregation secretary. He should contact your convention’s Rooming Department, using the information at the top of the list. Please wait for a revised list to be received for your convention, rather than calling a hotel that is not on the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ Reserve only the rooms you will actually use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ To guarantee your reservation, you must send a deposit to the hotel for each room reserved. Otherwise, the hotel can offer your room to someone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ Keep your first reservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ The congregation secretary may make a copy of the Recommended Lodging List for each book study overseer to share with his group only if the congregation has its two-day circuit assembly the week the convention assignment letter is read. No copies of the list are to be made for individual publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the Rooming Department has any questions regarding a special needs request, they will contact the congregation secretary.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Attending Another Convention: </span><span class="font2">Your circumstances may require that you attend a convention other than the one to which your congregation is assigned. If you need information about another convention, please see your congregation secretary. The reverse side of the Special Needs Room Request form has the current year’s conventions in the United States and Canada in date order, and the address for each convention headquarters is provided. Mail your request to the appropriate address, and include a selfaddressed, stamped envelope. If two or more conventions are held in the city, be sure your request indicates the dates of the convention you wish to attend. The Rooming Department for that convention will send you their most recent Recommended Lodging List.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> At a convention of Jehovah’s people held nearly 2,500 years ago, Ezra and his fellow Levites read from God’s Word and explained it to the gathered people. The result? Nehemiah 8:12 tells us that “all the people went away to . . . carry on a great rejoicing, for they had understood the words that had been made known to them.” Are we not grateful that the anointed slave class, like Ezra and the Levites, uses God’s Word, explains it, and shows us how to apply it in our lives? In so doing, that slave reflects Jehovah’s genuine love and concern for all His people. Make it your resolve not to miss a day of the “Walk With God” District Convention!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Call Promptly</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Call promptly on whom? On those who request literature or regular magazine delivery or who would like a Witness to visit them at their home. Where do these requests come from? From individuals who contact the branch office by mail or telephone or by means of our official Internet Web site. When such interest is shown, the branch office notifies the local congregation by means of the S-70 form, which is a slip with the heading “Please Arrange for a Qualified Publisher to Call on This Person.” When the elders receive an S-70 form, they should immediately pass it on to a publisher who will diligently follow through on the interest. If the publisher has difficulty finding the person at home, the publisher might try to contact him by telephone or discreetly to leave a note. If you are asked to make such a call, please make every effort to contact the interested person promptly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>The Theocratic Ministry School for 2004</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah equips ordinary people to accomplish work of universal importance. One way in which he does this is through the training provided each week at the Theocratic Ministry School. Are you participating as fully as your circumstances allow? In January a few adjustments will go into effect with a view toward helping students to get the most from the arrangements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Auxiliary Counselor Rotation: </span><span class="font1">Brothers who give instruction talks and Bible highlights have appreciated the observations offered by the auxiliary counselor. Where there are enough qualified elders, the assignment of auxiliary counselor may be rotated yearly. In this way, the work load can be shared; but more important, elders and qualified ministerial servants will profit from the collective experience of a variety of capable speakers and teachers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Oral Review Scheduling: </span><span class="font1">If your congregation has a circuit assembly on an oral review week, then the review (and the rest of the weekly schedule) should be postponed one week and the subsequent week’s schedule should be used one week early. However, it is not necessary to exchange two complete weekly schedules when the oral review coincides with a circuit overseer’s visit. Instead, the song, the speech quality talk, and Bible highlights should be presented as scheduled. The instruction talk (given after the speech quality talk) should be drawn from the following week’s schedule. Bible highlights will be followed by a half-hour Service Meeting, which can be adjusted so as to have either three 10-minute parts or two 15-minute parts. (Opening announcements should be eliminated.) The Service Meeting will be followed by a song and a half-hour program by the circuit overseer. The Theocratic Ministry School for the next week will proceed with the speech quality talk and Bible highlights as scheduled, followed by the oral review.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Take advantage of each opportunity for spiritual growth. As you benefit from your Theocratic Ministry School education, you encourage your congregation, play a part in the fulfillment of Bible prophecy, and bring praise to the Author of the wonderful message that we must proclaim. —Isa. 32:3, 4; Rev. 9:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A Video That Highlights an Important Medical Trend</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Legal and health-care professionals are giving increased attention to the ethical views and rights of medical patients. This has promoted new therapies and approaches from which Jehovah’s Witnesses can benefit. (Acts 15:28, 29) That is the focus of the video </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Transfusion-Alternative Health Care—Meeting Patient Needs and Rights.</span><span class="font1"> Watch it, and then review what you learned. —Note: Because the video includes brief surgical scenes, parents should use discretion in viewing the video with young children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(1) </span><span class="font1">Why is the medical community reevaluating the use of blood transfusions? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) </span><span class="font1">Give three examples of complex surgeries that are performed without blood transfusions. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(3) </span><span class="font1">How many physicians and surgeons worldwide have indicated their willingness to treat patients without blood transfusions?

How tolerable is it in humans? What can be done to compensate for it? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(8) </span><span class="font1">How can red-cell production be stimulated in a patient’s body? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(9) </span><span class="font1">What techniques are being used to minimize blood loss during surgery?

(12) Why is it important for Christians to make nonblood treatment choices in advance? How can we do this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Acceptance of some treatments featured in the video is a matter for private decision in accord with each one’s Bible-trained conscience. Have you decided which transfusion alternatives you are willing to accept for yourself and your children? Non-Witness family members should also be fully informed of your decisions and the reasons for them.—See “Questions From Readers” in the June 15 and October 15, 2000, issues of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">■ As a reminder to the brothers handling the congregation accounts, donations placed in the boxes for the Worldwide Work and for the Kingdom Hall Fund are to be remitted monthly and should not be used for payment on a Kingdom Hall property loan or for any other congregation expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed on the following Saturdays: March 13, 2004 (Gilead graduation); May 8, 2004 (spring cleaning); September 11, 2004 (Gilead graduation); and October 2, 2004 (annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania). There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on those dates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ The Memorial invitations for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2004 </span><span class="font13">in the primary language of each congregation will soon be sent to the congregation. If other languages are spoken in your territory and you would like a supply of invitations in those languages, these should be requested as soon as possible on a Literature Request form (S-14). A listing of the languages in which Memorial invitations are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed to all congregations each month. Please request only those languages needed for your territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ Please note that the Memorial for the year </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2005 </span><span class="font13">will be on Thursday, March 24, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. In such instances, the elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances from other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner. Because of the importance of the occasion, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders to be the Memorial speaker instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother every year. If there is a capable elder of the anointed who can give the talk, he should be selected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ From March 15, 2004, through May 16, 2005, the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Draw Close to Jehovah</span><span class="font13"> will be considered at the Congregation Book Study. Congregations in need of the large-print edition of this publication should submit their requests as early as possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Provisions to Help Us Abstain From Blood</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Baptized publishers who have previously completed an Advance Medical Directive/ Release card or Identity Card with no print date or a 3/99 print date will not need to complete a new one this year. For the Service Meeting the week of December 29, the secretary should have available sufficient quantities of the cards for newly baptized publishers, their children, and those needing replacements. Congregations will not be sent a consignment of these items. If the congregation does not have enough cards on hand, the secretary may check with nearby congregations or request more cards with the congregation’s next literature request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cards should be carefully filled out at home but NOT signed. At the next Congregation Book Study, the cards should be signed, witnessed, and dated, with assistance as needed from the book study overseer. Witnesses should actually see the cardholder sign the card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Publishers will not need to execute a new health-care durable power of attorney (DPA) form unless (1) their current one is dated prior to 1/2001 (12/2002 for Alabama; 8/2001 for North Dakota), (2) it does not reflect their current wishes, or (3) they have moved to another state. The secretary should also have sufficient quantities of the DPA form and the Advance Directive Guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Unbaptized publishers may write out directives for themselves and their children by adapting language from the Advance Medical Directive/ Release card, Identity Card, and DPA form.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Each person has a disposition that is rooted in his figurative heart. (Matt. 12:35) The Bible speaks of one whose “heart is disposed to fight.” (Ps. 55:21) Some are “disposed to rage.” (Prov. 29:22) But there are also those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (Acts 13:48) In our day, Jehovah is gathering to himself such rightly disposed ones. (Hag. 2:7) How can we help them to become worshipers of Jehovah?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Return Conscientiously: </span><span class="font1">Having the right view of making return visits is vital in order for us to fulfill our commission to make disciples. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Are we quick to follow up on the interest we find? Do we call again on all who accept literature or who express interest in the good news? Do we persist in our efforts to help them grow spiritually? Since lives are involved, we should seek to cultivate all the interest that we find.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> While a conversation with an interested person is still fresh in mind, take a moment to write down his name and address. Note the subject discussed, any scriptures that were read, and what literature was placed. Thereafter, make it a point to return as soon as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Making a Return Visit: </span><span class="font1">When you are making a return visit, it is helpful to be warm</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1. Who is Jehovah gathering to himself in our day?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2. What is involved in fulfilling our commission to make disciples?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">3. What should we do after conversing with someone in the ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">4. How can we make effective return visits? </span><span class="font1">and friendly and to show sincere personal interest in the householder. Keep the discussion simple and Scriptural. Prepare an appealing Bible subject to discuss, and at the conclusion of the call, raise a question that can be answered on the next visit. It is best to avoid needlessly taking issue with unscriptural views that the householder may express. Strive to build on things that you have in common.—Col. 4:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Making return visits requires effort, but the rewards are satisfying. A pioneer in Japan set a goal to make more return visits every month. He began keeping a record of all those he met in the house-to-house work, and then within seven days, he called on them again. He thoroughly prepared what he would say and carried out his service with complete confidence in the message he bore. On one of his calls, he was able to start a study with a person who had said: “I’ve always turned you people away. It’s the first time I’ve ever listened.” The pioneer’s loving persistence brought results. By month’s end he was reporting ten Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">’People’s circumstances are constantly changing. (1 Cor. 7: 31) It often takes several attempts to find an interested person at home again. By our conscientiously making return visits, we can help those who are rightly disposed to get on the road to everlasting life. —Matt. 7:13, 14.</span></p>

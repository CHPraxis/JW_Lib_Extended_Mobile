<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Sound in Mind as the End Draws Close</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> God’s Word repeatedly describes Jehovah’s day as coming “as a thief”—that is, suddenly, instantly, stealthily. (1 Thess. 5:2; Matt. 24:43; 2 Pet. 3:10; Rev. 3:3; 16:15) “On this account,” Jesus said, “prove yourselves ready, because at an hour that you do not think to be it, the Son of man is coming.” (Matt. 24:44) How can we maintain our spiritual readiness as the end draws close? A key is found in the inspired admonition: “Be sound in mind.” —1 Pet. 4:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Soundness of mind involves looking at things from Jehovah’s standpoint. (Eph. 5:17) It helps us to see ourselves as “aliens and temporary residents” amid the present system of things. (1 Pet. 2:11) It enables us to discern what is truly important, to set priorities, and to make good decisions.—Phil. 1:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Set Spiritual Goals: </span><span class="font9">Setting and attaining spiritual goals helps us to be sound in mind. Do you have spiritual goals that you are currently pursuing? Are you striving to read the Bible every day, attend all Christian meetings, read each issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font9">or perhaps increase your share in the ministry? If you set goals that are right for you, persist in pursuing them, and ask Jehovah to bless your efforts, you may be amazed at the results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> An elder asked a young couple about their spiritual goals. The question made them realize that if they simplified their life and eliminated burdensome debt, they could pioneer. They decided to make that their goal. They diligently paid off the debt and found ways to prune away unnecessary activities that were sapping their time and energy. Exactly one year later, they had reached their goal. With what result? The husband says: “Without goals we would not be where we are now. We are happier. Our life is calmer and better. It has real meaning and purpose.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> As we await Jehovah’s day, may we maintain our spiritual readiness by living with soundness of mind, keeping focused on doing God’s will.—Titus 2: 11-13.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Open Your Home?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In the first century, many Christians made their homes available to be used for congregation meetings. (1 Cor. 16:19; Col. 4:15; Philem. 1, 2) In some congregations today, there are not enough locations for Congregation Book Study groups and meetings for field service. This may result in some book study groups having 30 or more in attendance, far more than the preferred number of about 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> A Fine Privilege: </span><span class="font9">Have you considered opening your home for a Congregation Book Study? A room of sufficient size that is clean, well lit, and well ventilated is ideal for this purpose. Since the book study is a congregation meeting and part of Jehovah’s arrangement to instruct his people, having a book study in your home is a fine privilege. Many report that they have benefited spiritually by opening their home in this way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> If you think that your home is suitable, by all means make this known to the elders. They may be looking for additional locations. If it is not possible to have a book study in your home, could meetings for field service be held there? Even if there is not a need at the present time, the elders will appreciate knowing that your home is available. You may enjoy the privilege in the future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Showing Good Manners: </span><span class="font9">When gathering in a private home, all in attendance need to be respectful of the host’s property. Parents should make sure that their children remain in the area designated for the study, not venturing into private areas of the home. Consideration should also be shown for the neighbors, being careful to avoid unduly inconveniencing them.—2 Cor. 6:3, 4; 1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’Hebrews 13:16 encourages us not to forget “the doing of good and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.” Opening your home for a congregation meeting is a fine way to share good things with others and to “honor Jehovah with your valuable things.” —Prov. 3:9.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Preach and Give a Thorough Witness</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> As “a leader and commander,” Jesus prepared his disciples for the vast preaching work that lay ahead. (Isa. 55:4; Luke 10:1-12; Acts 1:8) The apostle Peter described the commission Jesus gave them in these words: “He ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness that this is the One decreed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.” (Acts 10: 42) What is involved in giving a thorough witness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> We can learn much from considering the example of the apostle Paul. When meeting with the older men from the congregation in Ephesus, he reminded them: “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house. But I </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">thoroughly bore witness</span><span class="font9"> both to Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.” Despite facing trials himself, Paul sought to reach as many as possible with the good news. He was not content to share just basic truths with his listeners, but he sought to impart “all the counsel of God.” To accomplish this, he was willing to exert himself and make sacrifices. He further stated: “I do not make my soul of any account as dear to me, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received of the Lord Jesus, to bear </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">thorough witness</span><span class="font9"> to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.”—Acts 20:20, 21, 24, 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> How can we imitate Paul’s example today? (1 Cor. 11:1) By searching for deserving households even when we ourselves are facing trials, by striving to reach people of all ethnic groups and languages with the good news, and by diligently cultivating the interest we find. (Matt. 10:12,13) This requires time, effort, and love for people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Can You Serve as an Auxiliary Pioneer? </span><span class="font9">March and April could be a fine opportunity for you to give a thorough witness by auxiliary pioneering. How encouraging it was last year to see so many make a special effort to auxiliary pioneer!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> An 80-year-old sister with many health problems was stirred by the encouragement provided by Jehovah’s organization. She wrote: “It set on fire the spark I’ve had in my heart for a long time, and it made me feel that I just had to auxiliary pioneer at least one more time.” She decided to aim for March. “The first thing I did,” she said, “was to sit down and count the cost. I talked it over with my daughter because I would need her help. She surprised me by getting an application for herself.” During the month, the elderly sister spent 52 hours in the ministry. “Many times I prayed to Jehovah to renew my strength when I felt it was giving out. At the end of the month, I was very happy and satisfied, and I have thanked Jehovah many times for helping me. I would like to try it again.” Her happy experience may encourage others who really want to auxiliary pioneer in spite of serious health concerns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> A brother who was unexpectedly laid off from his secular employment took advantage of the situation to auxiliary pioneer. As the month progressed, he became infused with zeal for the preaching work, and by the end of the month, he had started a new Bible study. Reflecting on the experience, he said: “What a month!” How elated he was for having Jehovah’s help! Yes, Jehovah emptied out a rich blessing upon him for the extra effort the brother put forth in the ministry, and he will do the same for you.—Mal. 3:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> For many, auxiliary pioneering is not easy. Nevertheless, despite secular and family responsibilities as well as personal challenges, a good number of brothers and sisters have been able to do so. Giving a thorough witness often involves a sacrifice of our precious time and energy, but the blessings are without equal. —Prov. 10:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> March and April are ideal times to auxiliary pioneer. There are five weekends during March. Taking advantage of these and making good use of the evening hours may allow some who work full-time to auxiliary pioneer. In addition, you may be able to take advantage of the holidays during the month of April. Some may have time off from school and secular work, which can help them to meet the 50-hour requirement. In order to schedule 50 hours in the ministry during March or April, can you use one of the sample auxiliary pioneer schedules included with this article? Discuss your schedule with others; some will no doubt be encouraged to join you in the ministry. If you are not able to auxiliary pioneer, set a specific goal for these months, and support those who are able to pioneer. Make your plans now for increased service during March and April.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Show Appreciation for the Memorial: </span><span class="font9">Each year during the Memorial season, gratitude for the ransom moves thousands to ‘buy out the time’ to be auxiliary pioneers. (Eph. 5: 15,16) In the United States last year, there were 126,378 auxiliary pioneers in March and 51,217 in April. That makes an average of 88,797 for each of these two months. Compare that with the average number of 21,505 who auxiliary pioneered during each of the previous months of the service year. This Memorial season is another fine opportunity to show our sincere appreciation for Christ’s ransom sacrifice by increasing our activity in the field ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> As April 16 approaches, contemplate what the Memorial means to you. Think about the events leading up to Christ’s death and the thoughts that weighed heavily on his mind and heart. Reflect, too, on the joy that was set before Jesus and how it helped him to endure such mistreatment. Ponder over his present position as Head of the congregation, overseeing the preaching and disciple-making work. (1 Cor. 11:3; Heb. 12:2; Rev. 14:14-16) Then demonstrate your appreciation for all that Christ has done by having as full a share in the preaching work as your circumstances allow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Encourage Others to Be Thorough: </span><span class="font9">By participating in the auxiliary pioneer service, elders and ministerial servants are in a good position to encourage others. When working with publishers in the field ministry and when making shepherding calls, they have fine opportunities personally to help others to have a full share in this special activity. May all of us make this a matter of prayer, thus adding force to our united efforts in giving a thorough witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>12</sup> While all elders and ministerial servants will cooperate with congregation arrangements for increased activity during the months of March and April, the service overseer in particular should be concerned with coordinating the evangelizing work. He should organize field service locations, days, and times that are convenient for the majority of the publishers and have these announced regularly. Arrangements may be made to meet at a number of different times during the day, giving all in the congregation an opportunity to share in various forms of witnessing. These might include working business territory, witnessing on the street, calling from house to house, making return visits, and witnessing by telephone. In addition, he should arrange for an ample supply of literature, magazines, and territory to be available during those months.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>13</sup> The offer for March will be the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font9">book, with the goal of starting Bible studies. Fine suggestions for offering the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font9">book appeared in the January 2002 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> insert.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">April’s offer will be the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">magazines. Try to utilize the suggested presentations appearing in “What to Say About the Magazines.” All should take time to prepare well so as to give a thorough witness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>14</sup> How blessed we are to work under the direction of the Head of the congregation, Christ Jesus, and have the privilege of sharing the good news with others! As the months of March and April approach, let us once again strive to make them our best months ever as we obey Christ’s order to preach and give a thorough witness.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Help at the Right Time</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> When the apostle Peter saw a need to strengthen fellow believers, concern moved him to give them loving reminders and encouragement. (2 Pet. 1:12, 13; 3:1) He urged ‘those who had obtained a faith’ to keep growing in spiritual qualities so as not to become “either inactive or unfruitful regarding the accurate knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (2 Pet. 1: 1, 5-8) Peter’s purpose was to help them make the calling and choosing they had received from Jehovah .sure, so that they might “be found finally by him spotless and unblemished and in peace.” (2 Pet. 1:10, 11; 3:14) For many, his encouragement proved to be help at the right time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Today, Christian overseers have similar concern for God’s people. In these “critical times hard to deal with,” many servants of Jehovah must contend with trying circumstances. (2 Tim. 3:1) Because of ongoing financial, family, or personal problems, some may feel as did David: “Calamities encircled me until there was no numbering of them. More errors of mine overtook me than I was able to see; they became more numerous than the hairs of my head, and my own heart left me.” (Ps. 40:12) These pressures can become so great that such ones may neglect vital spiritual matters and stop having an active share in the Christian ministry. Yet, despite their difficulties, ‘they have not forgotten Jehovah’s own commandments.’ (Ps. 119:176) Now is the right time for elders to provide such ones with needed help.—Isa. 32:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> To meet this need, the elders have been encouraged to make a special effort to assist those who are not currently having a share in the preaching work. A concerted effort to accomplish this is now in progress and will extend through the month of March. Book study overseers are being asked to visit inactive ones to offer spiritual assistance with a view to helping them renew their activity with the congregation. Where there is a need, a personal Bible study may be arranged. Others may be asked to assist. If you are invited to do so, your efforts could be very beneficial, especially if you give encouragement in a kind, understanding way. '</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> There is reason for all to rejoice when someone resumes his activity with the congregation. (Luke 15:6) Our efforts to encourage inactive ones may truly result in “a word spoken at the right time for it.” —Prov. 25:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>New Arrangement for Kingdom Hall Libraries</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">For many years now, congregations throughout the world have benefited from the use of their Kingdom Hall library, formerly called Theocratic Ministry School library. In the past, it was deemed necessary that each congregation acquire its own library. However, with many Kingdom Halls now being used by more than one congregation, some of which are foreign-language congregations, it seems best to have only one well-equipped, up-to-date Kingdom Hall library per language group in each Kingdom Hall. In Kingdom Halls that have more than one auditorium, each auditorium should have a library for each language group meeting there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is expected that this arrangement will help conserve space and expense. Moreover, merging the libraries of two or more congregations will most likely bring about better libraries. As these are combined, duplicate copies of books may be stored and later used when new Kingdom Halls are built. If the Kingdom Hall is equipped with a computer with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Library</span><span class="font9"> on CD-ROM, some may find this tool very beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For each Kingdom Hall library, one brother, preferably one of the Theocratic Ministry School overseers, will serve as the librarian. He should progressively add appropriate publications to the collection, neatly marking the inside cover of each one to show that it belongs to the Kingdom Hall library. At least once a year, he should check the library for completeness and ensure that the publications are in good condition. Publications from these libraries should not be taken out of the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Kingdom Hall library continues to be greatly appreciated by all those associated with the congregation. May we show that we personally value this provision by taking care of it and by using it to search out “the very knowledge of God.” —Prov. 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">THEOCRATIC MINISTRY SCHOOL REVIEW</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The following questions will be considered orally at the Theocratic Ministry School during the week beginning February 24, 2003. The school overseer will conduct a 30-minute review based on material covered in assignments for the weeks of January 6 through February 24, 2003. [Note: Where there are no references after the question, you will need to do your own research to find the answers.—See </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School, </span><span class="font10">pp. 36-7.]</span></p>

All of those required to do so should comply with this law, viewing It as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. From the time he registers until the year he turns 26, a brother must notify Selective Service of any change of address within ten days of the change.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Video That Will Enlighten and Inspire You!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">It was April 1951. Thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the former Soviet Union—entire families—were rounded up, loaded into boxcars, and exiled to Siberia. Why was the mighty Soviet government bent on stamping them out? How did our brothers survive and even prosper despite decades of unrelenting persecution?

<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What Is Your Priority?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Many religious organizations place emphasis on doing charitable works, such as providing facilities for secular education or medical needs. Jehovah’s Witnesses, however, while not forgetting “the doing of good and the sharing of things with others,” give priority to helping people spiritually.—Heb. 13:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> The First-Century Pattern: </span><span class="font9">Jesus did many good works during his earthly ministry, but his primary work was that of bearing witness to the truth. (Luke 4:43; John 18:37; Acts 10:38) He commanded his followers to “go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them.” (Matt. 28:19,20) And he indicated that those exercising faith in him would carry out on a much larger scale the work that he had initiated. (John 14:12) Jesus gave priority to the preaching work because it helps people to learn the way of salvation.—John 17:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The apostle Paul viewed his preaching activity as a “necessity,” a requirement that he could not ignore. (1 Cor. 9:16, 17) He was willing to make any sacrifice, endure any trial, or suffer any hardship necessary in order to accomplish his ministry. (Acts 20:22-24) The apostle Peter and his associates showed a like spirit. Even in the face of imprisonment and beatings, “they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.” —Acts 5:40-42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> What about us? Do we give priority to the work of proclaiming the Kingdom good news and making disciples? Like Jesus, do we have real concern for those who are “skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd”? (Matt. 9:36) Current world events and Bible prophecy clearly establish that time is running out for this wicked system! Having in focus the importance of the preaching work will move us to continue preaching zealously.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Evaluate Your Circumstances: </span><span class="font9">Since personal circumstances often change, it is good periodically to consider if we can make adjustments so as to have a fuller share in the preaching work. One sister had been a regular pioneer during the ’50’s, ’60’s, and ’70’s but found it necessary to stop because of poor health. In time, however, her health improved. She recently reevaluated her circumstances and determined that she could pioneer again. How happy she was to attend the Pioneer Service School at the age of 90! How about you? Are you nearing retirement or graduation? Might your changed circumstances allow you to pioneer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> When Jesus observed that Martha “was distracted with attending to many duties,” he kindly suggested that she would reap greater blessings if she kept things simple. (Luke 10:4042) Can you simplify your lifestyle? Is it really necessary for both husband and wife to be secularly employed? If adjustments are made, can the family live on just one income? Many have benefited spiritually by making adjustments so as to have a greater share in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> May all of us follow the pattern set by Jesus and the apostles! We can be certain of Jehovah’s blessing on our genuine endeavors to have a full share in the vital work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom. —Luke 9:57-62.</span></p></li></ul>

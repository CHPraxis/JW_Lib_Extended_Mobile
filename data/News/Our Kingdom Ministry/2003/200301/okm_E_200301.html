<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Living Up to Our Dedication</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Whether you were baptized recently or decades ago, you likely remember that milestone in your life. Our baptism is not the end but, rattier, the beginning of a lifetime of dedicated service that can last forever. (1 John 2:17) What is involved in living up to our dedication?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Follow Christ’s Example: </span><span class="font13">Upon being baptized, Jesus “commenced his work,” declaring “the good news of the kingdom of God.” (Luke 3:23; 4:43) Similarly, upon symbolizing our dedication to Jehovah by baptism, we became ordained ministers of the good news. While much time and effort may be required to obtain the material necessities of life, our vocation, or chief work, is the Christian ministry. (Matt. 6:33) Rather than striving to attain wealth or prestige, those dedicated to God seek to ‘glorify their ministry,’ as did the apostle Paul. (Rom. 11:13) Do you cherish your privilege of serving Jehovah and make the most of it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> As in the case of Jesus, we must “oppose the Devil.” (Jas. 4:7) Satan tempted Jesus following His baptism, and he similarly targets dedicated servants of Jehovah today. (Luke 4:113) Being surrounded by Satan’s world, we must exercise self-discipline, avoiding anything that could contaminate our mind or corrupt our heart. (Prov. 4:23; Matt. 5:29, 30) Christians are admonished that they “cannot be partaking of ‘the table of Jehovah’ and the table of demons.” (1 Cor. 10:21) This requires that we guard against unwholesome entertainment, bad associations, and dangers on the Internet. It also calls for our shunning apostate material. Being alert to these and other tactics of Satan will help us to live up to our dedication.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Use God’s Provisions: </span><span class="font13">In order to help us live up to our dedication, Jehovah has provided assistance by means of his Word and the Christian congregation. Make Bible reading and prayer to Jehovah part of your daily routine. (Josh. 1:8; 1 Thess. 5:17) Take delight in congregation meetings. (Ps. 122:1) Associate with those who fear Jehovah and keep his orders.—Ps. 119:63.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> With divine support, you can live up to your dedication to Jehovah and have the joy of serving him forever.—Ps. 22:26, 27; Phil. 4:13.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A Work That Calls for Humility</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> God’s Word admonishes us to be “humble in mind, not paying back injury for injury . . . but, to the contrary, bestowing a blessing.” (1 Pet. 3:8, 9) That counsel certainly applies in the preaching work. Indeed, the Christian ministry can be a test of our humility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Humility is a quality that helps us to endure unpleasant situations. When preaching, we approach strangers uninvited, knowing that some will respond in an unkind manner. To keep preaching in the face of such treatment takes humility. In one particularly difficult territory, two pioneer sisters went from door to door every day for two years without getting anyone to answer! However, they persevered, and today there are two congregations in that area.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Handling Rudeness: </span><span class="font13">Humility will help us to imitate Jesus when others are unkind or impolite. (1 Pet. 2:21-23) At one home a sister met with verbal abuse, first by the wife and then by the husband, who ordered her off the property. The sister simply smiled and said that she hoped to talk to them at another time. This so impressed the couple that they listened to the next Witness who called and accepted an invitation to attend a meeting at the Kingdom Hall. The sister who had initially been rebuffed was there to greet them and to give them a further witness. We too may soften un-receptive ones by displaying “a mild temper and deep respect.” —1 Pet. 3:15; Prov. 25:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Avoid Arrogance: </span><span class="font13">Our knowledge of the Bible provides no basis for looking down on people or referring to them in disparaging terms. (John 7:49) Rather, God’s Word counsels us “to speak injuriously of no one.” (Titus 3:2) When we are lowly in heart, as Jesus was, we refresh others. (Matt. 11: 28, 29) A humble approach adds appeal to our message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Yes, humility helps us to persevere in difficult territory. It can soften unreceptive ones, and it attracts others to the Kingdom message. Above all, it pleases Jehovah, who “gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.”—1 Pet. 5:5.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Question Box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">■ When is it appropriate to form a foreign-language group?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When a congregation’s territory includes a sizable foreign-language population, the elders should do what they can to organize the preaching work in that language, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(km</span><span class="font13"> 7/02 p. 1; </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font13"> 2/98 pp. 3-4) It may be that the foreign-language community is widely scattered throughout the territories of two or more neighboring congregations. In such a case, the circuit over-seer(s) will provide needed direction, thus helping the congregations involved to cooperate in the preaching activity. Periodically, a public talk or </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">Study may be arranged to determine the extent of support for the meetings in the foreign language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A foreign-language group can be formed when the following requirements are met: (1) There are publishers or interested ones who best understand the good news in the foreign language. (2) A qualified elder or ministerial servant is available to take the lead and conduct at least one weekly meeting. (3) A body of elders is willing to sponsor the group. When these requirements </span><span class="font12">Every effort should be made to start a home Bible study, especially if some individuals have already studied the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font12"> book and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Starting in February, and no later than March 2, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Deliverance From a World of Darkness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Wednesday, April 16, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown.</span><span class="font12"> Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Most groups begin by holding the Congregation Book Study on a weekly basis. Later, the elders may approve of adding other meetings, such as the Public Meeting and the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font13">Study. Assignments No. 2, 3, and 4 on the Theocratic Ministry School may be presented in an auxiliary classroom if a qualified elder or ministerial servant conversant in the language can serve as the counselor. However, the group will join the congregation for the speechquality talk, instruction talk, Bible highlights, and Service Meeting. Meetings for field service may also be arranged for the group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">All in the group work closely under the oversight of the body of elders. The elders should provide balanced direction and show initiative in caring for the needs of the group. When the circuit overseer visits the sponsoring congregation, he will also arrange to work with the group in order to build it up spiritually. With Jehovah’s blessing, the foreign-language group may in time become a congregation. </span><span class="font12">use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from the occasion. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ As of this issue, the list of new publications available will no longer appear in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font12"> The “Announcement to All Congregations” with this information will continue to be mailed to all congregations each month. As a reminder, once the “Announcement to All Congregations” is received, an announcement should be made at the next Service Meeting regarding the items that may be of interest to your congregation. The announcement may then be posted on the information board. After that, the literature servant should retain it in his file.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Presentations for </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Draw Close to Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ With Bible in hand, say: “Many people who believe in God would like to feel closer to him. Did you know that God invites us to draw close to him? [Read James 4:8.] This publication is designed to help people use their own Bible to draw close to God.” Read paragraph 1 on page 16. ■ With Bible in hand, say: “Today injustice abounds. It is just as described here. [Read Ecclesiastes 8: 9b.] Many wonder if God even cares. [Read the first two sentences of paragraph 4 on page 119.] This chapter explains why God has permitted injustice for a time.”</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Despite coming from many ‘nations, tribes, peoples and tongues,’ Jehovah’s Witnesses are a united people, a true international brotherhood. (Rev. 7:9) In today’s divided world, that is remarkable. How is it possible? Because we have been given “the change to a pure language.”—Zeph. 3:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Marvelous Effects: </span><span class="font13">What is this pure language? It is the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">proper understanding of the truth found in God’s Word regarding Jehovah and his purposes,</span><span class="font13"> particularly the truth about God’s Kingdom. As foretold by Jesus, this truth is being dispensed by means of a visible earthly channel, “the faithful and discreet slave,” with the result that people “out of all the languages of the nations” are embracing true worship. —Matt. 24:45; Zech. 8:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> As people learn the pure language, they are moved to conform their lives to Jehovah’s standards. They learn to be “fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought.” (1 Cor. 1:10) Divine teaching also produces in them upright conduct and wholesome, truthful speech, especially with regard to telling others the good news. (Titus 2:7, 8; Heb. 13:15) These marvelous changes honor Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> For example, a man who was contacted with the good news had many questions, all of which were answered from the Bible. Moved by what he heard, he began studying twice a week and attending meetings. He was surprised by the warm welcome he received at the Kingdom Hall, since many in attendance were of a different race. Within a short time, he and his wife made changes in their lives and got baptized. Since then he has helped some 40 others to serve Jehovah, including numerous family members. Despite suffering from a disability, he recently began serving as a pioneer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Teaching Others: </span><span class="font13">World events are causing many honest people to reexamine their thinking and their lives. Like Jesus, we should desire to help them. Effective return visits and Bible studies are a key to helping sincere ones to learn the pure language.</span></p></li>

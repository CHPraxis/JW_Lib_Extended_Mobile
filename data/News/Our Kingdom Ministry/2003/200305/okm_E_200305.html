<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Entrusted With the Good News</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> How privileged we are to be entrusted with the good news of God! (1 Thess. 2:4) While some may refuse this powerful message, honesthearted ones are drawn to it as to a lovely fragrance. (2 Cor. 2:14-16) For those who accept and obey the good news, it means salvation. (Rom. 1:16) How should we care for this trust?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Jesus and the Apostles: </span><span class="font14">Jesus put proclaiming the good news in first place. (Luke 4: 18, 43) Even when he was tired and hungry, his love for people and his appreciation for the message moved him to share it with others. (Mark 6:30-34) By word and example, he impressed upon the minds of his disciples the importance of the Kingdom-preaching work. —Matt. 28:18-20; Mark 13:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> In imitation of Jesus, the apostles zealously declared the Kingdom message. Even when beaten and ordered to stop preaching, “they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news.” (Acts 5: 40-42) The apostle Paul worked tirelessly in this work. (1 Cor. 15:9,10; Col. 1:29) He likened the privilege of sharing the good news to a debt owed to his fellowmen, and he was willing to forgo personal convenience in order to discharge it.—Acts 20: 24; Rom. 1:14-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Our Privilege Today: </span><span class="font14">Appreciation for the sacred commission entrusted to us will move us to seek ways to expand our share in the preaching work. (Rom. 15:16) Edward, who was confined to a wheelchair, would sit at the entrance of a hotel and talk to guests about his faith. Desiring to do more, however, he had a special cab built on a pickup truck, and by means of this vehicle, he pioneered for many years, traveling thousands of miles in the process. Like Edward, many today have adjusted their circumstances to have a greater share in spreading the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> In imitation of Jesus and the apostles, may we today always give the preaching work priority in our lives. By so doing, we demonstrate our love for people as well as our appreciation of the good news entrusted to us.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Praise Jehovah by Witnessing Informally</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s loyal servants seek opportunities to praise him each day. (Ps. 96:2, 3; Heb. 13:15) One way we can do that is by witnessing informally. Many worshipers of Jehovah today are thankful that someone introduced them to the Kingdom message through informal witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Giving an informal witness to one person often opens the way for others to hear the Kingdom message. For example, Jesus’ conversation with a Samaritan woman at Jacob’s fountain led to many more taking an interest in the good news. (John 4:6-30,39-42) While Paul and Silas were imprisoned in Philippi, they witnessed to the jailer, and the man’s entire household accepted the truth. —Acts 16:25-34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Opportunities: </span><span class="font14">What opportunities do you have to witness informally? Some do so when shopping, taking public transportation, or waiting at medical appointments. Others are able to witness during breaks at work or school. Simply having one of our Bible publications visible may prompt others to inquire about our beliefs.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Getting Started: </span><span class="font14">A shy seven-year-old girl heard at a meeting how important it is for all to preach. So when going shopping with her mother, she put two brochures in her bag. While her mother was busy at the counter, the girl offered a brochure to a lady, who graciously accepted it. When asked how she got the courage to approach the lady, this shy girl replied: “I just said, Ready, Set, Go! And I went!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> To witness informally, we all need a spirit like that little girl’s. What can help us? Pray for the courage to speak up. (1 Thess. 2:2) Have in mind a question or comment on a topic of interest that you can use to initiate a conversation. Then trust that Jehovah will bless your efforts.—Luke 12:11, 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Witnessing informally to the people we meet each day brings praise to Jehovah and gives us joy. It may help someone get on the road to everlasting life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font14">Honorable Marriage—A Divine Requirement. Talk and audience discussion. In many lands, it is common for couples to live together without being legally married. Some claim that this has practical advantages. Highlight the Bible’s view, emphasizing that marriage is of divine origin, (rs pp. 248-9) Living together without the benefit of marriage is fornication. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(fy</span><span class="font14"> p. 17) Contrary to what many believe, studies show that living together before marriage reduces the likelihood that the marriage will succeed. (p02 3/8 p. 29; p92 9/8 p. 28; p91 5/8 p. 28) Christians honor Jehovah by conforming to his standards. In doing so, they also benefit themselves—Isa. 48:17,18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> In recent decades the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses in a number of European lands, including Eastern Europe, was restricted. In most cases, the restrictions were quite severe. It was difficult to hold meetings openly, and having the use of a Kingdom Hall was nearly impossible. In recent years, however, “Jehovah has done a great thing in what he has done with us. We have become joyful.” -Ps. 126:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> Beginning in 1983, the oppressive grip on Jehovah’s Witnesses began to loosen. By 1989, Poland and Hungary had granted Jehovah’s Witnesses legal recognition. In 1991, Jehovah’s Witnesses were granted legal registration in Russia. Since then, the work has prospered in Russia and in the former republics of the Soviet Union. Between March 1996 and October 1998, the Governing Body gave approval to 359 Kingdom Hall loan requests from branch offices overseeing 11 European lands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> As you look over the pictures in this insert, reflect on the great and wonderful things that Jehovah has done in behalf of his people. (Ps. 136:4) Take pleasure in knowing that contributions of the worldwide brotherhood are being put to excellent use, reflecting what Jesus stated, as recorded at John 13:35: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”</span></p></li>

With the aid of moneys contributed to the Kingdom Hall Fund, hundreds of Kingdom Halls have been built in Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Russia, and Serbia and Montenegro.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Building Kingdom Halls in some lands has not been easy, and much effort must be put forth before actual construction can begin. Often the process is time-consuming. Then, too, the cost of building a Kingdom</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">Hall in that part of Europe is much greater than in many parts of Africa or South America. However, because of the large increase in the number of those who worship Jehovah, hundreds of Kingdom Halls are still needed in European countries with limited resources!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> How marvelous it is to see such rapid increase in the building of these Kingdom Halls!

<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Isaiah aptly prophesied about the increase in true worship at this time. Through the prophet God foretold: “I myself, Jehovah, shall speed it up in its own time.” (Isa. 60:22) Certainly, the last decade has proved to be Jehovah’s time for increase in Eastern Europe. May Jehovah continue pouring out his rich blessing upon our efforts to speed up the building of Kingdom Halls in many lands as we give further support to the Kingdom Hall Fund! This will result in many more Kingdom Halls being added in lands with limited resources. It will contribute to the growth of pure worship in many parts of Europe and to a greater witness being given to “the extremity of the earth.”—Acts 13:47.</span></p></li></ul>

Every effort should be made to start a home Bible study, especially with individuals who have already studied the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font14"> book and the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font14"> brochure. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">June, July, and August: </span><span class="font14">Offer the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font14"> book or the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font14"> brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read. ■ Donations made by check and put in the local Kingdom Hall contribution boxes for the worldwide work and the Kingdom Hall Fund should be made payable to “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Donations made by check at district conventions and those sent to the branch office should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” The branch office financial address is Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, c/o Office of the Secretary and Treasurer, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Beginning with the May literature shipment, the annual supply of congregation forms is being shipped to congregations as forms become available. Instructions regarding forms distribution will appear on the shipment packing list. When there is more than one congregation in a Kingdom Hall auditorium, the literature coordinator should make sure that each congregation receives its supply of forms as soon as they arrive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ Congregation secretaries should maintain an adequate supply of the forms Application for Regular Pioneer Service (S-205) and Application for Auxiliary Pioneer Service (S-205b). These can be ordered on the Literature Request Form (S-14). Maintain at least a one-year supply. Review all regular pioneer application forms to make sure they are complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ It is necessary for the branch office to maintain an up-to-date record of addresses and telephone numbers for all presiding overseers and secretaries. If there is a change at any time, the Congregation Service Committee should complete, sign, and send a Presiding Overseer/ Secretary Change of Address (S-29) form to the branch office promptly. This includes any changes in telephone area codes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">■ When witnessing by telephone, should we explain the donation arrangement?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When we give a witness in person, it may be possible to explain that the worldwide Bible educational work of Jehovah’s Witnesses is supported entirely by voluntary donations and that we are happy to accept such donations. However, no mention of donations or the donation arrangement should be made when witnessing by telephone, as this could be misinterpreted as a form of telephone solicitation. The ministry of Jehovah’s Witnesses is noncommercial in every way.—2 Cor. 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ When witnessing by telephone, what should we do if a person requests that Jehovah’s Witnesses not call again?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The wishes of the person should be respected. A </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">dated</span><span class="font14"> note with the name of the person should be placed in the territory envelope so that publishers will avoid calling that number in the future. Once a year, the list of people who have requested that we not call should be reviewed. Under the direction of the service overseer, experienced, tactful publishers can be assigned to contact these people to determine their current feelings. —See the June 1994 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> Question Box.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> “The substance of your word is truth,” wrote the psalmist. (Ps. 119:160) Through his inspired Word, Jehovah gives satisfying answers to life’s most important questions. He offers comfort and hope to those who are troubled. And he shows us how we can draw close to him. “Learning the truth from the Bible is like leaving a very dark and gloomy place and entering a clear, bright, and pleasant room,” said one appreciative woman. Do you endeavor to share the truth from God’s Word at every opportunity?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Transforming Power and Universal Appeal: </span><span class="font14">Bible truth has the power to touch hearts and transform lives. (Heb. 4:12) A young woman named Rosa had become involved in prostitution, as well as alcohol and drug abuse. “One day, when I was at the very depths of despair,” she says, “a Witness couple spoke to me about how the Bible can help us solve our problems. I began to study God’s Word, which I found fascinating. Within a month I had the strength to make a clean, fresh start in life. Now that I had a purpose in life, I no longer needed the crutch of alcohol or drugs. And since I wanted so much to be Jehovah’s friend, I was determined to live by his standards. If it hadn’t been for the practical wisdom of God’s Word, I am sure that by now I would have put an end to my life.”—Ps. 119:92.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">1. What important information does the Bible contain?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2. How does the Bible improve people’s lives?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Unlike most books today, the Bible appeals to people of ‘all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues.’ (Rev. 7:9) God’s will is “that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) Therefore, we should never presume that a person will be unreceptive to the good news simply because of his background. Rather, share the Kingdom message with all, doing so directly from the Bible whenever possible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Feature the Scriptures: </span><span class="font14">There are many opportunities to use the Bible in the ministry. When presenting the magazines, try to include the scripture that appears in the suggested presentation. When using the literature offer for the month, some find it effective to include the reading of a carefully selected scripture in their opening remarks. When making return visits, share one or more Bible texts each time to help the householder progressively acquire accurate knowledge. When conducting a Bible study, center the discussion on the key scriptures. When not sharing in the formal ministry, have a Bible handy to use when opportunities arise to witness informally. —2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> May we help others benefit from the motivating power of God’s Word of truth by using the Bible at every appropriate opportunity in our ministry. —1 Thess. 2:13.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">“Daily we hear reports of violence. Do you think such conditions ever existed before? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible says. [Read Matthew 24:37.] Noah’s days were so bad that God swept away all but Noah and his family. This magazine shows how those events have meaning for us today.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">“Today, insect-borne disease is one of many dangers to our health. Did you know that there are measures we can take to protect ourselves? [Allow for response.] This magazine discusses these measures, as well as the Bible’s promise of a time when there will be no more sickness.” Conclude by reading Isaiah 33:24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">“Reports of mismanagement of donated funds have caused some to wonder if it is wise to give to charity. Yet, there are so many people in need. What do you think can be done? [Allow for response. Then read Hebrews 13:16.] This magazine explains the kind of giving that pleases God.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">“It appears that people today do not value morals and good manners as they did in years past. Have you observed that to be true? [Allow for response.] Interestingly, the Bible made this prediction.

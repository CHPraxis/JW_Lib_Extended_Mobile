<p><span class="font9">September 2003</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For United States of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">km-E Us 9/03 Vol. 46, No. 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">dear Offimffio/n ffiab/ 'r/icrs :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“God kept making it grow.” (1 Cor. 3:6) How thrilling it has been to see the growth in the United States field! During the 2003 service year, over 70,000 new Bible studies were started. This is commendable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah is blessing the activity in the foreign-language field. Congregations or groups have been established in 37 languages besides English and Spanish. Recently, the first Amharic and Indonesian congregations in the branch territory were formed. May we strive to reach the estimated 28 million foreign-born people living in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To supply literature for the growing worldwide field, the printery at Watchtower Farms, near Wallkill, New York, is being expanded. Good progress is being made in adding three and a half acres of floor space. This is equivalent to 30 average-size Kingdom Halls! Two large, state-of-the-art printing presses are scheduled to arrive early in 2004. Each press will be able to produce up to 25 magazines a second. New bindery and shipping equipment will also be installed during 2004. This will result in greater production with reduced personnel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we begin the 2004 service year, we join with you in praying that Jehovah will ‘keep making it grow.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brothers,</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Clothe Yourselves With Humility</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup>A shepherd boy trusts in Jehovah and defeats a mighty warrior. (1 Sam. 17:45-47) A wealthy man patiently endures calamity. (Job 1:20-22; 2:9, 10) God’s Son directs all credit for his teaching to his Father. (John 7:15-18; 8:28) In each of these examples, humility played a key role. Similarly today, humility is vital in the situations that we face. —Col. 3:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> When Preaching: </span><span class="font4">As Christian ministers, we humbly share the good news with people of all sorts, not prejudging them on the basis of their race, culture, or background. (1 Cor. 9:22, 23) If some are rude or arrogantly reject the Kingdom message, we do not respond in kind but patiently go on searching for deserving ones. (Matt. 10:11, 14) Rather than trying to impress others with our knowledge or education, we direct attention to God’s Word, recognizing that it is more persuasive than anything that we might say. (1 Cor. 2:1-5; Heb. 4: 12) In imitation of Jesus, we give all praise to Jehovah.—Mark 10: 17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> In the Congregation: </span><span class="font4">Christians must also ‘gird themselves with lowliness of mind toward one another.’ (1 Pet. 5:5) If we consider others as superior to ourselves, we will look for ways to serve our brothers rather than expecting them to serve us. (John 13:12-17; Phil. 2: 3, 4) We will not feel that we are above such tasks as cleaning the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Humility helps us to ‘put up with one another in love’ and thus promotes peace and unity in the congregation. (Eph. 4:1-3) It helps us to be in subjection to those who are appointed to take the lead. (Heb. 13:17) It moves us to accept any counsel or discipline we may be given. (Ps. 141:5) And humility prompts us to rely on Jehovah when we care for any privileges we may receive in the congregation. (1 Pet. 4:11) Like David, we recognize that success depends not on human ability but on God’s blessing. —1 Sam. 17:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Before Our God: </span><span class="font4">Above all, we need to ‘humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God.’ (1 Pet. 5:6) If we must contend with trying circumstances, we may long for the relief that the Kingdom will bring. But we humbly exercise patience, waiting for Jehovah to fulfill his promises at his appointed time. (Jas. 5:7-11) As was true of integrity-keeping Job, our foremost concern is that “the name of Jehovah continue to be blessed.”—Job 1:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> The prophet Daniel ‘humbled himself before his God’ and was blessed with Jehovah’s favor and many fine privileges. (Dan. 10:11, 12) May we likewise clothe ourselves with humility, knowing that “the result of humility and the fear of Jehovah is riches and glory and life.”—Prov. 22:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">Increased theocratic activity brings greater joy. So there is great rejoicing as the United States branch prepares to move its printing, binding, and shipping operations from Brooklyn to Wallkill, New York. The existing printery at Wallkill is being renovated, a large addition is under construction, and new equipment has been purchased and will soon be in stalled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Since 1927, the printery in Brook</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">moved to Wallkill where efficient printing, binding, and shipping equipment could be installed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The consolidation of the U.S. printery operations at Wallkill would not be possible without the recent reorganization of our worldwide production of books. Prior to this reorganization, the United States branch produced almost 50 percent of the books used in our work worldwide. Some book production has been shifted to other branches, making better use of their facilities and leaving the United States with a reduced workload. It will also be necessary to provide six branches, including the United States, with a total of seven new printing presses. The use of new, more efficient equipment will make it possible to increase production worldwide with reduced personnel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">New Equipment for Wallkill Printery: </span><span class="font21">It was with great excitement that the Bethel family received the news that the Governing Body approved the purchase of two new high-speed MAN Lithoman rotary web offset presses for Wallkill. These new high-speed presses are capable of producing magazines and book signatures (individual printed sections of a book) at a rate of 90,000 per hour. This means that an average congregation order of 350 magazines can be produced in just 14 seconds. The two new presses, along with the three existing MAN Lithoman presses at Wallkill, will be able to supply the needs of the United States field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">As mentioned in the branch letter on the first page of this issue of </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font21"> new bindery equipment will also be installed at Wallkill. The new equipment is capable of producing hardcover books and deluxe Bibles at a rate of 120 a minute. The bindery will be set up with much of the equipment linked together by conveyors, allowing for efficient use of space and personnel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The Shipping Department is also being designed for greater accuracy and efficiency by making better use of computer tools. A new high-rise storage system will allow literature to be stored in less than half the floor space currently used in Brooklyn. These improvements will contribute to a streamlined flow of literature to the over 12,000 congregations and groups in the United States and other areas we serve.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Construction Update: </span><span class="font21">The progress on the printery addition at Wallkill has been excellent, with significant milestones reached successfully! The shell of the building, from foundation to roof, will be completed next month. Landscaping is nearly complete, and a massive mechanical system is being installed. Efforts to complete the interior, along with exterior finish work, have commenced in earnest. Work is also under way to renovate the existing printery building to accommodate new equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The printery addition is scheduled to be substantially completed by February 2004 so that presses can be installed. There will be a total of 590,000 square feet, or 13 acres, of space ready for use. This includes a new 140,000-square-foot building and the renovation of the existing 450,000-square-foot printery building. To put this in perspective, it is the equivalent of 8 Assembly Halls or 125 Kingdom Halls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Help Is Appreciated! </span><span class="font21">Doubtless, it is the desire of each one of us to support this advancement of Kingdom interests fully. The number volunteering to assist with the construction work will likely exceed 1,000, and their assistance is greatly appreciated. Circumstances may not permit most of us to assist with the actual work, yet we are eager to provide support. How can we do so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The total cost for the printery addition at Wallkill, including two of the seven new presses and other new production equipment, will likely be $50 million. Where does the money come from to pay for all of it? From voluntary contributions placed in the box marked “Contributions for the Worldwide Work—Matthew 24:14” in every Kingdom Hall, together with donations sent to the branch office by Christians who wish to see the will of God accomplished. Where there has been a need, Jehovah’s loyal servants have always responded generously. For example, in Moses’ day, material things were needed to construct the tabernacle with all its glorious attachments and utensils. The privilege of sharing in building the tabernacle went out to all of God’s servants, and they gave according to their ability.—Ex. 35: 4-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">As this tremendous project nears completion (likely in early 2005), we will inform the congregations so that individuals and families can arrange to visit the new facilities. In the meantime, may we take this opportunity to thank you</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font21">for making possible the greatly increased theocratic activity at the United States branch. May Jehovah continue to bless all of us spiritually as a result.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">■ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office within 30 days after reaching 18 years of age. A male noncitizen under the age of 26 who takes up residency in the United States must also register with Selective Service within 30 days of becoming a resident. All of those required to do so should comply with this law, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. From the time he registers until the year he turns 26, a brother must notify Selective Service of any change of address within ten days of the change. Elders should be aware of young brothers nearing the age of 18 and new alien residents between the ages of 18 and 26 and remind them of their duty to register with the Selective Service System.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Worship the Only True God</span><span class="font20"> is designed to be studied with new ones after they have completed a study of the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font20"> book. Our consideration of this publication at the Congregation Book Study will equip us to use this tool in the ministry and will help us to deepen our love and appreciation for Jehovah and his organization. How can we benefit fully from our study of the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Worship</span><span class="font20"> God book?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Conducting the Study: </span><span class="font20">Since we will be considering a full chapter each week, book study overseers will need to apportion the time wisely. They will want to keep the study moving during the introductory paragraphs to allow more time for the weightier material, which generally appears later in the chapter. Briefly discussing the review box at the conclusion of each study will assist those present to retain the key points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Indented questions for meditation and discussion appear in about half the chapters of the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Worship God</span><span class="font20"> book. An example can be found on pages 48-9. It is not necessary for such questions to be read along with the paragraphs. When considering them with the group, the overseer should have the cited scriptures read and discussed as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Advance Preparation: </span><span class="font20">Preparing well for the study involves more than underlining the answers. Prayerful meditation on the cited scriptures will enable us to prepare not only our comments but, more important, our hearts. (Ezra 7:10) All of us can contribute to an interchange of encouragement by modestly offering our comments.—Rom. 1:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Our study of the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Worship God </span><span class="font20">book will help us to draw close to Jehovah and will equip us to help honesthearted ones join us in worshiping him. (Ps. 95:6; Jas. 4:8) May all of us benefit fully from this fine spiritual provision.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> What is foremost in your mind? What do you think about? Are your primary concerns centered on things present, or do they reach into the future and focus on what God has promised? (Matt. 6:24, 3133; Luke 8:14) Strong faith is needed to act on God’s promises, as can be seen from the examples of Abraham and Moses. (Heb. 11:8-10, 24-26) How can you develop such faith and build “a fine foundation for the future”?—1 Tim. 6:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Search for Jehovah: </span><span class="font4">If you have a routine of spiritual activity with your family, that is commendable. But do not assume that such a routine will automatically produce strong faith. To find “the very knowledge of God,” you must personally search for Jehovah. (Prov. 2:3-5; 1 Chron. 28:9) Young King Josiah did that. Despite growing up in a less-than-ideal spiritual environment, “he started to search for the God of David his forefather” when he was 15 years old.—2 Chron. 34:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> How can you search for Jehovah? By carefully examining what you believe and ‘proving to yourself’ that it really is the truth. (Rom. 12:2) For example, can you explain what the Bible says about blood or prove that God’s Kingdom began ruling in the heavens in 1914? Acquiring “an accurate knowledge of truth” is an important part of building a fine foundation for the future—1 Tim. 2:3, 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. Why do Christian youths need to develop strong faith?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. What do we learn from King Josiah’s example?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. How can young Christians today search for Jehovah?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Josiah’s search for God yielded good results. Before he reached the age of 20, he acted courageously to rid the land of false worship. (2 Chron. 34:3-7) Likewise, your spiritual progress will become manifest by your actions. (1 Tim. 4:15) If you are an unbaptized publisher, strive to improve the quality of your ministry. Do not be content simply to offer literature. Make it your aim to use the Bible, to reason with people, and to cultivate the interest that you find. (Rom. 12:7) This will help you to grow spiritually.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Give Jehovah Your Best: </span><span class="font4">When you symbolize your dedication to Jehovah by getting baptized, you become an ordained minister of God. (2 Cor. 3:5, 6) This opens up opportunities for you to serve Jehovah full-time. These include pioneering as well as Bethel, missionary, and international service. Still other ways to expand your ministry are by learning another language or by moving to serve where the need is greater.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Of course, not all can make themselves available for these privileges of service, but each of us can give Jehovah his best. (Matt. 22:37) Whatever your circumstances, make serving Jehovah the focus of your life. (Ps. 16:5) By so doing, you will be building a fine foundation for the future.</span></p></li></ul>

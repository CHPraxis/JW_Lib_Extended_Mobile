<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">November 2003 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 11/03 Vol. 46, No. 11</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Prove Yourselves Ready”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In his great prophecy regarding the conclusion of this system of things, Jesus cautioned against becoming absorbed by the mundane concerns of life. (Matt. 24:36-39; Luke 21:34, 35) Since the outbreak of the great tribulation can occur at any time, it is imperative that we heed Jesus’ admonition: “Prove yourselves ready, because at an hour that you do not think to be it, the Son of man is coming.” (Matt. 24:44) What can assist us in this regard?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Combating Anxieties and Distractions: </span><span class="font12">One of the spiritual pitfalls we must guard against is “anxieties over livelihood.” (Luke 21:34, ftn.) In some lands, poverty, unemployment, and the high cost of living make it difficult to obtain the necessities of life. In other lands, acquiring material possessions is commonplace. If concern over material things begins to dominate our thinking, we are in danger of losing our focus on Kingdom realities. (Matt. 6:1924, 31-33) Christian meetings help us to maintain that focus. Do you make it your aim to attend every meeting?—Heb. 10: 24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The world today is full of distractions that can easily rob us of precious time. Computer use can become a snare if one spends inordinate amounts of time browsing the Internet, reading and sending E-mail, or playing computer games. Countless hours can be lost to television, movies, hobbies, secular reading, and sports, leaving us with little time or energy for spiritual pursuits. While recreation and relaxation can provide refreshment temporarily, personal and family Bible study yield everlasting benefits. (1 Tim. 4:7, 8) Do you buy out time to meditate on God’s Word each day?—Eph. 5:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> How grateful we can be that Jehovah’s organization has arranged a program of spiritual instruction to help us “succeed in escaping all [the] things that are destined to occur, and in standing before the Son of man”! (Luke 21:36) May we take full advantage of these provisions and ‘prove ourselves ready’ so that our faith may be “a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.”—! Pet. 1:7.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Commendation Refreshes</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Haven’t I been a good girl today?” the little girl sobbed at bedtime. That question took her mother aback. Despite having noticed how hard her little girl was trying to behave that day, she had neglected to express even one word of appreciation. That little girl’s tears should serve as a reminder that all of us—young and old—need commendation. Do we refresh those around us by expressing appreciation for the good that they do?—Prov. 25:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Fellow Christians give us many good reasons to commend them. Elders, ministerial servants, and pioneers work hard to fulfill their responsibilities. (1 Tim. 4:10; 5:17) Godfearing parents do their utmost to raise their children in Jehovah’s ways. (Eph. 6:4) Christian youths put up a hard fight to resist “the spirit of the world.” (1 Cor. 2:12; Eph. 2:1-3) Others faithfully serve Jehovah despite advancing age, health problems, or other trials. (2 Cor. 12:7) All such ones deserve commendation. Do we acknowledge their praiseworthy efforts?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Personal and Specific: </span><span class="font12">We all truly appreciate hearing commendation from the platform. However, commendation is even more refreshing when it is directed to us personally. For example, in chapter 16 of his letter to the Romans, Paul made specific expressions of appreciation regarding Phoebe, Prisca and Aquila, Try-phaena and Tryphosa, and Persis, among others. (Rom. 16:1-4, 12) How refreshing his words must have been to those faithful ones! Such praise reassures our brothers and sisters that they are needed and serves to draw us closer together. Have you given specific personal commendation recently?—Eph. 4:29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> From the Heart: </span><span class="font12">To be truly refreshing, commendation must be sincere. People can tell whether we are speaking from the heart or we are merely ‘flattering with the tongue.’ (Prov. 28:23) As we train ourselves to notice the good in others, our heart will be moved to commend. May we be generous in giving genuine commendation, knowing that “a word at its right time is O how good!” —Prov. 15:23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">“Prove Yourselves Ready.” * Invite the audience to comment on what helps them to keep the anxieties and distractions of the present system of things from consuming time that would be better spent in spiritual pursuits.</span></p>

Being able to teach effectively is a primary goal in our ministry. Our success in helping sheeplike ones depends on our ability to convey the Kingdom message in a way that informs and motivates them. Discuss the following questions: (1) What is the difference between preaching and teaching? (if-2 p. 672 par. 2) (2) Why are some hesitant about trying to conduct a Bible study? (3) How can we improve our teaching ability? (4) How can we make sure our student gets the sense of what he is learning? (5) What goal should we try to help the student to achieve?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 70 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">* Limit introductory comments to less than a minute, and follow with a question-and-answer discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Use the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Worship God </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Book to Conduct Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Worship the Only True God</span><span class="font0"> is designed to help newer ones advance in the truth and deepen their appreciation for Jehovah and his organization. It can be used with Bible students as the second study book. The June 2000 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font0"> page 4, explained: “If it is evident that a person is making progress, although slowly, and that he is developing appreciation for what he is learning, then continue the Bible study in a second book after the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font0"> brochure and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font0"> book are completed. ... In all cases, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font0"> brochure and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font0"> book would be studied first. The Bible study, return visits, and time spent to continue the study should be counted and reported, even if the student gets baptized before completing the second book.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Who else can benefit from a Bible study in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Worship God </span><span class="font0">book? That same article continues: “If you know of some who studied [the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font0"> brochure and] the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font0"> book in the past but never progressed to dedication and baptism, you may want to take the initiative to see if they would like to resume their Bible study.” Let us make good use of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Worship God</span><span class="font0"> book to help others join us in serving the only true God.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Question</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"> BOX</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">■ Should a family Bible study be reported to the congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If a Christian parent conducts a family Bible study and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">unbaptized</span><span class="font12"> children are involved, the parent may report a maximum of one hour a week, one return visit a week, and one home Bible study a month. This is the case even if the study lasts for more than one hour, is conducted more than once a week, or is conducted with the children individually. —See the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font12"> book, p. 104.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If all in the household are </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">baptized</span><span class="font12"> Witnesses, then neither the time nor the study itself is reported as field service (unless a child is still studying the second book after baptism). This is because the congregation’s field service report reflects primarily what is being accomplished in preaching the good news and teaching Bible truth to those who are not dedicated and baptized servants of Jehovah. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) However, this in no way diminishes the importance of holding such a study regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is the responsibility of Christian parents to study with their children. Those who need assistance in establishing or improving their family study may ask the elders for help. If circumstances make it advisable for another publisher to conduct a Bible study with an </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">unbaptized </span><span class="font12">son or daughter of a Christian family associated with the congregation, the presiding overseer or service overseer should be consulted. If such a study is approved, the one conducting it may report it just as he or she would any other Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Training children in Jehovah’s ways involves far more time and effort than appears on a field service report. (Deut. 6:6-9; Prov. 22:6) Christian parents are to be commended for shouldering their weighty responsibility to bring up their children “in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.”—Eph. 6:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “I have been existing in the truth for the past 20 or so years by just going to meetings and engaging in the field ministry,” admitted one Christian sister. However, she continues: “I have come to the conclusion that although these things are important, they alone cannot sustain me when things start getting difficult. ... I realize now that I have to readjust my thinking and begin a meaningful study program so that I can really get to know Jehovah and come to love him and appreciate what his Son has given us.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Building a close personal relationship with Jehovah takes effort. It requires more than merely following a routine of Christian activity. If we fail to commune regularly with Jehovah, in time he can become to us like a once-close friend with whom we have lost touch. (Rev. 2:4) Let us examine how personal Bible study and prayer can help us to cultivate intimacy with Jehovah. —Ps. 25:14.</span></p></li>

(Jas. 4:8) Serious study requires time as well as the proper setting, and regular study takes discipline. (Dan. 6:10) Even if your life is very busy, are you setting aside time each day to meditate on Jehovah’s marvelous qualities?—Ps. 119:147, 148; 143:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Heartfelt prayer is a vital part of meaningful personal study. For Bible truths to stir our hearts and move us to “render God sacred service with godly fear and awe,” we need God’s holy spirit. (Heb. 12:28) Therefore, we should open each study period by begging Jehovah for his spirit. (Matt. 5:3, ftn.) As we ponder the Scriptures and use the study aids provided by Jehovah’s organization, we open our heart to Jehovah. (Ps. 62:8) Undertaking study in this manner is an act of worship by which we express our devotion to Jehovah and strengthen our attachment to him. —Jude 20, 21.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> As with all relationships, our relationship with Jehovah must be nurtured continually in order for it to keep growing throughout our lives. May we, therefore, buy out time each day to draw close to God, knowing that he, in turn, will draw close to us.—Ps. 1:2, 3; Eph. 5:15, 16.</span></p></li></ul>

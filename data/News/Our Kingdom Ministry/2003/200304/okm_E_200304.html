<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Shining as Illuminators”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Amid the spiritual and moral darkness of the present system of things, some six million worshipers of the true God, Jehovah, are “shining as illuminators” in 234 lands worldwide. (Phil. 2:15) This causes us to stand out. How do we reflect the precious light of truth that emanates from Jehovah?—2 Cor. 3:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Our Actions: </span><span class="font13">People are quick to notice our conduct. (1 Pet. 2:12) One woman observed that a Witness coworker was kind and helpful and did not use foul language or laugh at unclean jokes. When others tried to provoke the Witness by using profanity in his presence, he remained calm yet firm for what is right. What effect did this have on the woman? She recalls: “I was so impressed with his conduct that I started asking questions about the Bible. I began studying God’s Word and was later baptized.” She adds: “It was his conduct that convinced me to examine the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Our attitude toward authority, our view of worldly practices, and our wholesome speech cause Jehovah’s Witnesses to stand out as a people who live by the Bible’s lofty standards. Such fine works can bring glory to Jehovah and attract others to his worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Our Words: </span><span class="font13">Of course, those who see our fine conduct may not know why we are different unless we speak to them about our beliefs. Do those with whom you work or attend school know that you are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Do you look for opportunities to turn an ordinary conversation into a witness? Is it your resolve to “let your light shine before men” on every appropriate occasion? —Matt. 5:14-16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Fulfilling our commission as light-bearers calls for a spirit of self-sacrifice. A whole-souled attitude will move us to forgo less important things in order to do as much as we can in the lifesaving work of preaching and making disciples.—2 Cor. 12:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> By our actions and words, may we continue shining as illuminators. If we do, others may be moved to join us in giving glory to Jehovah.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Make Room for It”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Once, when speaking with his disciples about marriage, Jesus referred to singleness as ‘a gift.’ Then he said: “Let him that can make room for it make room for it.” (Matt. 19:10-12) Some years later, the apostle Paul wrote about the advantages of singleness and encouraged others to follow his example in remaining unmarried. (1 Cor. 7:7, 38) Many today have ‘made room’ for singleness and are enjoying its advantages. What are some of these?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Serving “Without Distraction”: </span><span class="font13">Paul understood that singleness afforded him the opportunity to serve Jehovah “without distraction.” Likewise today, a single brother can reach out for Ministerial Training School, and a single person is generally freer to enter the pioneer work, learn another language, move to where the need is greater, serve at Bethel, or be available for other special privileges of service. He may have more time and opportunities to engage in deep personal study and meditation and to commune with Jehovah in heartfelt prayer. The unmarried person usually has more time to give of himself in assisting others. All such activity is to one’s “personal advantage.” —1 Cor. 7:32-35; Acts 20:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Such undistracted service to God brings rich rewards. After 27 years in Kenya, a single sister wrote: “There were so many friends and such a lot of work! We did things together [and] visited one another. ... I was able to use the extra freedom and mobility that singleness affords to keep busy in the ministry, and this has brought me great happiness.” She added: “Over the years my relationship with Jehovah has deepened.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Making Room for it: </span><span class="font13">Jesus said that the motive for cultivating the gift of singleness should be “on account of the kingdom of the heavens.” (Matt. 19:12) As with any gift, singleness must be used properly to bring joy and benefits. By seizing the opportunities that singleness brings and by relying on Jehovah for wisdom and strength, many unmarried people have come to understand the value of making room for the gift.</span></p>

Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to repeat pointed counsel from this month’s insert that applies locally. During the month of October, an entire Service Meeting will be arranged to review highlights of the convention program. In preparation for that discussion, all of us can take meaningful notes at the convention, including a list of specific points that we wish to apply personally in our own life and in the field ministry. Then we can encourage others by explaining how we have applied the suggestions.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Gathering Together to Praise Jehovah</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is almighty in power, unsearchable in wisdom, perfect in justice, and the personification of love. As Creator, LifeGiver, and Universal Sovereign, he alone is worthy of our worship. (Ps. 36:9; Rev. 4:11; 15: 3, 4) This summer’s “Give God Glory” District Convention will strengthen our resolve to praise him as the only true God.—Ps. 86: 8-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Good Planning Needed: </span><span class="font14">For us to benefit fully from the spiritual feast Jehovah has in store, good planning is essential. (Eph. 5: 15, 16) Have you completed your arrangements for lodging, transportation, and time off from work or school? Do not leave these important matters to the last minute. If you delay in asking for time off, you may miss a portion of this joyful occasion. All of us need to be present for every session.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Make it your aim to arrive early at the convention site each day. That will enable you to be settled in your seat before the opening song and will help you to be in the proper frame of mind to receive the instruction that is presented. Doors will open at 8:00 a.m. each day. Please do not save seats other than for those in your immediate family or car group.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> It is requested that all bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain food during the noon break. Your cooperation with this arrangement contributes to a peaceful atmosphere and allows more time for association with fellow believers. (Ps. 133: 1-3) Please bear in mind that glass containers and alcoholic beverages are not permitted in the convention facilities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Listen and Learn: </span><span class="font14">Ezra prayerfully prepared his heart to receive the word of God. (Ezra 7:10) He inclined his heart to Jehovah’s teachings. (Prov. 2:2) We can begin preparing our hearts for the convention even before we leave home by meditating on the convention theme and discussing it with our family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> In a large auditorium, there can be many sights and sounds to grab our attention. Such distractions can easily turn our minds away from the speaker. When that happens, valuable information is lost.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">The suggestions found in the accompanying box can help us to improve our concentration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Show Consideration for Others: </span><span class="font14">Cameras and camcorders may be used during the program, but to avoid distracting others, do so only from your seat. Cell phones and pagers must be set so that they do not disturb others. For the benefit of those who are hard-of-hearing, the program will be broadcast in the vicinity of the convention site via FM radio. An announcement providing necessary details will be made at the beginning of the first session. You will need to bring your own small FM receiver with earphones. No personal equipment should be connected to the convention site’s electrical or sound systems.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> How we look forward to gathering together to praise Jehovah! May we be determined to glorify him by attending every session, by listening attentively, and by applying what we learn.—Deut. 31:12.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Be an Example in Fine Works</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> When we gather in large numbers at district conventions, the way we act and how we treat others become especially noticeable to onlookers. Each of us, therefore, needs to give special attention to the Bible’s admonition: “Be sound in mind, in all things showing yourself an example of fine works.” (Titus 2:6, 7) Extra effort may be required to ‘keep an eye, not in personal interest upon just our own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.’ (Phil. 2:4) Let us consider some areas in which we can apply this encouragement at our upcoming “Give God Glory” District Convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Rooming Arrangements: </span><span class="font14">An excellent opportunity for us to display fine works is when making rooming arrangements. Please reserve only the hotel room you plan to use. Be sure to make the appropriate deposit in advance. During the busy check-in and checkout times, it is especially appreciated if we display the fruitage of God’s spirit. (Gal. 5:22, 23) For example, it may not be possible for everyone to obtain a nonsmoking room, even if you requested this when you made your reservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Our personal interest in others should be seen in our use of any complimentary breakfast arrangements. It is not appropriate to take to the convention site food that has been provided for hotel guests. It is appreciated when we conscientiously observe</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1. Why do we need to be especially conscious of our conduct at the district convention?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2. What should we bear in mind in connection with rooming arrangements?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">3. How can we “work what is good toward all” at the hotel?</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">Be Considerate of Others</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">■ Reserve only the room you plan to use</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ Be patient during check-in and checkout</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ Do not abuse breakfast arrangements</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ Properly supervise your children</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ Leave an appropriate tip</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">hotel rules and show consideration for the staff by leaving in the room a customary tip. In these ways we “work what is good toward all” and thus give a fine witness to others.—Gal. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Parents and Children: </span><span class="font14">In a world where so many youths are ill-mannered, our children stand out as different, and this brings praise to Jehovah and his organization. At times, however, problems have resulted when children were not properly supervised. (Prov. 29:15) Parents should not leave their children unattended at the hotel, including the swimming pool, or at the convention site.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Before the convention some parents have found it helpful to review with their children the kind of behavior that is expected of them. (Eph. 6:4) They help their children understand that genuine Christian love “does not behave indecently” or “look for its own interests.” (1 Cor. 13:5) The district convention is a time set aside to be taught by Jehovah, and children as well as adults can show respect for this arrangement by their conduct both at the convention site and elsewhere.—Isa. 54:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Our fine conduct can do much to counter misconceptions and attract people to true worship. (Matt. 5:16; 1 Pet. 2:12) May all of those with whom we come in contact at our district convention receive a favorable witness by the way we act and how we treat them. In this way we will ‘show ourselves an example of fine works’ and glorify Jehovah.—Titus 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">4, 5. How can children bring praise to Jehovah, and what responsibility do parents have?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">6. What effect can our fine conduct have on others?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Well-Arranged Dress Shows Reverence for God</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Soon we will have the privilege of being Jehovah’s guests at the 2003 “Give God Glory” District Convention. How thankful we are to Jehovah for inviting us to such a rich spiritual feast! We can demonstrate our reverence for him and our appreciation for his spiritual provisions by the way we dress and groom ourselves.—Ps. 116:12, 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Clean and Orderly: </span><span class="font14">Our appearance should reflect the standards of our God, who is clean and orderly. (1 Cor. 14:33; 2 Cor. 7:1) Our person, hair, and nails should be clean, and we should be neatly groomed. Sloppy grooming is common today. However, just because a movie star or sports hero looks disheveled is no reason for a Christian to do so. If we follow fads, people may have difficulty seeing the distinction between those who are serving the true God and those who are not serving him.—Mal. 3:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Dress That Befits Christian Ministers: </span><span class="font14">When the apostle Paul wrote to the Christian overseer Timothy, he encouraged “women to adorn themselves in well-arranged dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, ... in the way that befits women professing to reverence God, namely, through good works.” (1 Tim. 2:9, 10) To ensure that our attire is well-arranged requires careful thought.

<p><span class="font14">Being balanced in the use of jewelry, makeup, and other adornments is a wise course for Christian women to follow.—Prov. 11:2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> The counsel Paul directed toward Christian women also applies in principle to Christian men. Brothers should avoid styles that reflect the thinking of the world. (1 John 2:16) For example, in some lands baggy, oversized clothing is popular, but this style does not present a fitting appearance for a minister of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> During Leisure Activities: </span><span class="font14">When attending the program, most brothers and sisters set an excellent example in the matter of dress and grooming. However, reports indicate that some become lax when traveling to and from the convention or when engaging in leisure activities after the sessions. Really, our personal appearance—whether during the program or at other times—influences how others view God’s people. Since we wear our convention badge cards, we should always dress in a way that befits Christian ministers. This often moves others to compliment us and opens the way to give a witness.—1 Cor. 10:31-33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Just as a kind smile enhances the appearance of our face, so well-arranged dress and grooming dignifies the message we bear and the organization we represent. Some who observe us during the “Give God Glory” District Conventions this year may be moved to inquire why we are different and may eventually say: “We will go with you people, for we have heard [and observed] that God is with you people.” (Zech. 8:23) May each of us show our reverence for Jehovah by our dress and grooming.</span></p></li></ul>

When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Those planning to tour the U.S. branch facilities may wish to arrange their visits on a weekday (Monday through Friday, between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.) rather than on Saturday morning. This will allow them to view Bethel departments in full operation. Those wishing to tour on Saturday morning are certainly welcome. However, they will receive only a limited tour, since many Bethel family members are sharing in the field ministry or other theocratic activities at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ DISTRICT CONVENTION CHANGE: Because of circumstances beyond our control, the dates for the district convention in Uniondale, New York, on September 5-7, 2003, have been changed to July 25-27, 2003.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ DISTRICT CONVENTION CORRECTION: The address appearing on page 30 of the March 1, 2003, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> for the district conventions to be held in Columbia, South Carolina, is incorrect. The correct address is as follows: The Carolina Center, 801 Lincoln Street.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 2003 will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these unless you have a foreign-language group associated with your congregation. Based on the size of each congregation, cards will be shipped in lots of 25. If additional badge cards are needed by the congregation, these should be requested on a Literature Request Form (S-14). Plastic badge holders must be requested for any in the congregation who desire them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ DISTRICT CONVENTION PARKING: At all convention sites where we have secured control of the parking facilities, the spaces will be made available at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. No parking tickets will be used, but convention badge cards will serve as identification for parking. Only those who have a state-approved disabled license plate or placard will be allowed to park in the parking reserved for the disabled. Being aware that considerable expense is involved, we can show our appreciation by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at our Kingdom Hall or at the convention. Any checks contributed at the convention should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” Since parking space is usually limited, carpooling should be done to the extent possible rather than having only one or two persons per car. At a few locations, this parking arrangement cannot be fully Implemented this year. Congregations affected by any variation in this arrangement will be so advised by their local convention headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Whenever personal travel plans include attending congregation meetings, an assembly, or a district convention in another land, your request for information regarding dates, times, and locations must be directed to the branch office that oversees the work in that land. Addresses of branch offices are listed on the last page of the current </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Question box</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ What cautions should we heed when witnessing to prison inmates?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Worldwide there are at least eight million prison inmates, some of whom show an interest in the good news. (1 Tim. 2:4) One branch office receives some 1,400 letters each month from inmates and their family members requesting literature or a personal visit. While the interest of many inmates is sincere, experience has shown that some feign interest, seeking to take selfish advantage of God’s people. In view of this, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font13">should heed the following cautions regarding witnessing to prison inmates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In many cases inmates are given a witness by means of correspondence. It is strongly recommended that sisters </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">not write to male prisoners,</span><span class="font13"> even if it is with the goal of giving spiritual help. That responsibility should be handled only by qualified brothers. Qualified sisters may be assigned to correspond with female inmates who express sincere interest in Bible truth. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Money or personal gifts should not be sent to inmates,</span><span class="font13"> despite the fact that such may be requested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When an incarcerated person shows interest, his name and address should be turned over to the congregation in the area of the prison facility. Usually the qualified brothers there know how to handle the various situations that can arise. If the congregation is not known, the information should be sent to the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is not objectionable for the assigned brothers to hold meetings with prisoners so that several may study at one time. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">However, special events in which publishers mingle freely with inmates should not be held in prisons.</span><span class="font13"> Furthermore, it is ill-advised for publishers to visit a prison indiscriminately and have close association with prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">May we be “cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves” as we share the good news with prison inmates. —Matt. 10:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus commissioned his followers not only to preach but also to “make disciples . . . , teaching them.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) A preacher proclaims, but a teacher does more.

<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> On whom should you make return visits? Be sure to call back on all who accept literature or who show even a spark of interest in the good news. If you And interest when witnessing in a public setting, seek to obtain the person’s address or telephone number so that the interest can be cultivated. Be optimistic about starting Bible studies. Continue to search for those who will accept an offer to study the Bible, and you will likely And them.—Matt. 10:11.</span></p></li>

Make it your aim to share at least one upbuilding Scriptural point each time, and be willing to listen. Get to know the householder better.

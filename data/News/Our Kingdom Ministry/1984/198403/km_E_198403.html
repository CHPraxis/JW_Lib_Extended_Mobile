<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare for the Memorial Celebration</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>1</sup> On Sunday, April 15, after sundown, Jehovah’s people will gather for a most sacred occasion. This will be to memorialize the death of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Master. This joyous celebration, known as the Lord’s Evening Meal, serves as a reminder to each of us of the liberating effect of Christ’s sacrifice. We Rejoice in the great love that Jehovah has shown in giving his own Son to provide the redemption price for us. (Rom. 5:6-8) How happy we can be to have availed ourselves of his ransom sacrifice! Once again we can show our appreciation by being supportive of the arrangements for celebrating the Memorial this year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>2</sup> The first essential is to make definite plans to be in attendance ourselves. Also, at an early date, we will want to begin inviting Bible students, relatives and other interested persons. Can definite arrangements be made to provide transportation for those who may need help in getting to the meeting? With the Memorial on a Sunday this year, it should be possible for most persons to adjust their affairs to attend, provided they are invited several weeks in advance and then reminded again closer to the actual date.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Will You Serve as an Auxiliary Pioneer in April?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>1</sup> To worship God means to serve him. For the Israelites, worshiping Jehovah required obedience to his commands, doing his will as a people exclusively devoted to him. (Ex. 19:5; Josh. 24:14, 15) As Christians our worship of Jehovah includes preaching the good news of the Kingdom and teaching others the truths we have learned. (Matt. 28:19, 20) By our obedience to Jesus’ command we are in effect serving and worshiping Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">INCREASE YOUR SERVICE DURING APRIL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>2</sup> Many publishers select certain opportune times during the year to have a greater share in preaching the good news that is vital to the salvation of others. (Rom. 10:10-15) Many are serving as auxiliary pioneers </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">this </span><span class="font17">month. Can you increase your sacrifices of praise to Jehovah as an auxiliary pioneer </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">next</span><span class="font17"> month? (Heb. 13:15) Have you seriously thought about making up a schedule that will allow you to auxiliary pioneer for one month or more? The requirements are set forth in the book </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry,</span><span class="font17"> pages 113 and 114. Why not discuss the matter with your mate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>3</sup> Elders have many advance preparations to make for the Memorial celebration. These include arrangements for the speaker, distribution of the printed invitations, preparing the proper emblems (see w76 2/1 74, 75), organizing the attendants and servers, cleaning and arranging the Kingdom Hall, and so forth. If all things are diligently cared for in advance, the celebration will be a complete success.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEFITS TO THOSE WHO ATTEND</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>4</sup> On this sacred occasion the anointed partake of the emblems, thus acknowledging that they have been taken into the new covenant and that they expect to share with Christ in his heavenly Kingdom. (Rom. 8:16, 17, 23) Their obediently partaking shows that they greatly esteem Christ’s sacrifice by which they are sanctified as parties to the new covenant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>5</sup> Million^ of others with an earthly hope attend but do not partake of the emblems. Still, they receive many benefits as a result of Jesus’ sacrifice, including God’s forgiveness of their sins through Christ’s blood. They observe the occasion with great </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 7, col. 3) </span><span class="font17">your parents or another publisher in the congregation? Close cooperation in this endeavor can bring success. —Prov. 15:22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEFITS FROM AUXILIARY PIONEER SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>3</sup> Increased field service activity brings personal benefits. Being occupied daily with preaching the good news causes one’s heart and mind to focus on Scriptural thoughts. This can enhance our spirituality, and this will be reflected in our attitude, outlook and conduct. Our happiness increases because we know we are doing the work God approves. Also, we improve in our own ability to express the good news clearly and understandably. Special joy results when we are able to start a home Bible study. Additionally, the fruitage of the spirit usually becomes more evident in our lives. In fact, some publishers have said that their relationship with others in the congregation and in their own family improves when they are more active in the field service. Others state that by organizing their affairs to be an </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 3)</span></p>

Some congregations still have on hand a number of previous tracts that present a timely message. Are you using these tracts in your ministry?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>2</sup> Much good can be accomplished in the house-to-house ministry by discreetly leaving a tract where no one is found at home. Also a tract may be offered to a person who demonstrates a measure of interest but does not wish to accept a magazine or other publication offered on a contribution basis. Some have found it is often effective to begin their presentations by offering a free tract.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>3</sup> Since </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font17"> tracts are published from time to time, each on a timely subject, why not become thoroughly familiar with these tracts and make good use of them in fulAlling your Kingdom ministry?</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>1</sup> Unique! That is what you could call the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font18"> and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font18"> magazines. Right now there are at least 10,952 periodicals published in the United States, myriads more worldwide, but </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">only two of</span><span class="font18"> them—</span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font18"> and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font18">—point the way to eternal life. Do you fully appreciate their high value?—Prov. 9:10, 11; John 17:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>2</sup> Remember, at one time you were searching for the path to eternal life. Thankfully the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font18"> and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font18"> magazines helped you find it. Or, perhaps it was your parents that groped for the truth. They found it and now you, too, have it. Again, the magazines helped.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>3</sup> Likewise today, there are honest-hearted ones who are entangled in the present wicked system and who are also searching for a way out. They sense that life and the world have lost meaning. Instead of hope, they sense doom. (Ps. 12: 1, 2, 5; Ezek. 9:4) Proverbs 29:18 accurately describes why they feel despair and then offers the remedy: “Where there is no vision the people go unrestrained, but happy are they that are keeping the law.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font18"> and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font18"> sharpen the readers’ eyes as to how a peaceful, righteous future can be obtained, helping them to see the wisdom of following Jehovah’s laws. (Jer. 29:11) “For the one finding me [wisdom] will certainly find life, and gets goodwill from Jehovah,” says Proverbs 8:35.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">MAGAZINE WITNESSING POINTS PEOPLE TO LIFE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>5</sup> Witnessing with magazines can benefit all sorts of people, who live anywhere, under every circumstance, who are bewildered by this system. Why? Because our magazines are like a compass. No matter who the person is or Which way he faces, whether the sky is clear or cloudy, a compass will always point him in only one direction. Likewise, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font18"> and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font18"> always point in only one direction—Jehovah’s way to eternal life—helping people to steer a safe course through the muddle of this wicked system. Therefore, are you and your family regular in magazine activity?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>6</sup> Our magazines have proved to be highly effective tools in carrying on our field ministry. These magaizines are fresh, alive, keeping up with events of the day. They are the product of research in the Scriptures done by the “faithful and discreet slave,” and they present true evaluations of the latest developments in world affairs, science, archaeology and matters related to Christian faith and living. (Matt. 24:45) Many probably do not realize the great amount of time that is spent in preparing articles for publication. Do not take the magazines for granted. Because we receive a magazine almost every week, we may tend to underestimate its worth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>7</sup> People in the medical profession, educators, social workers and other professionals, not to mention our own brothers and sisters, regularly comment on the value of the articles in </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font18"> and </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! For</span><span class="font18"> example, note what non-Witnesses say about our magazines:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18">• “I am a professor of biological science and at times I have had difficulty in harmonizing science and religion. The last issue of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font18"> made so many things clear.”—Brazil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• “Reading your magazines is a genuinely joyful experience. They are not cheap, low-quality ‘comforters,’ but contain guidance and direction on how to make life meaningful.”—Germany.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• “It is so refreshing to read the magazines again and I must add that </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font18"> is my medical ‘up-date’ and is really worth it for that alone.” (Retired medical doctor)—England.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">• “Awake!</span><span class="font18"> not only widens my knowledge but also broadens my outlook. I commend the printers and publishers for their meritorious service.”—Nigeria.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>8</sup> ‘Are the magazines less important in the preaching work than books?’ some ask. Well, is a hammer less important in the construction trade than a saw? Both are vital. Though each tool has a different function, both contribute to the common goal of building something. All published items are important in getting the preaching work done. Consider what one traveling overseer wrote about the value of magazines:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font18">“Many people do not care to read a book of many pages; they prefer short stories, brief articles that can be read quickly—magazines serve that purpose very well.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Magazine witnessing, therefore, should occupy an important part of our field service schedule.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>9</sup> In addition, magazines that are placed give an effective witness long after we leave the door, and eventually they give a witness to more people. (Statistics show that, on the average, a secular magazine is read by more than four people.) Therefore, let the magazines speak!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">IMPORTANCE OF MAGAZINE PLACEMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">“Interest in magazines is alive and growing. Consider these facts: Last year, more than one new consumer magazine </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">a week</span><span class="font18"> was published just in the United States. Nine out of ten </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">youths </span><span class="font18">between the ages of 10 and 18, and nine out of ten </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">adults</span><span class="font18"> read at least one magazine every month. Also, when you approach a newsstand, what do you see? </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Magazines.</span><span class="font18"> At a corner store, what catches your eye? </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Magazines.</span><span class="font18"> What makes a postman bend under the weight of his mailbag? </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Magazines.</span><span class="font18"> Thus, what are people reading? </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Magazines!</span><span class="font18"> The world is magazine conscious.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HAVE YOU TRIED MAGAZINE DAYS?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>11</sup> Magazine days are a time-tested way to reach people with the Kingdom message. They are field service days, usually on Saturday, set aside for magazine witnessing. Magazine street witnessing became a milestone in our theocratic history more than 44 years ago. The January 1940 issue of the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Informant (Our Kingdom Ministry)</span><span class="font18"> encouraged publishers to schedule a special day each week for street witnessing, using the magazines. In 1949 the house-to-house ministry with the magazines was introduced as a part of Magazine Day. But house-to-house magazine witnessing was not stressed until the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Informant of </span><span class="font18">October 1952 said:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font18">“The most effective means of distributing the magazines is from house to house and store to store. Hence the Society recommends that these avenues of magazine distribution be a regular part of Magazine Day activity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">That advice regarding magazine distribution is still valid today.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>12</sup> The service overseer, the brother handling the territory, and you, can help to make magazine days a success. How? First, the service overseer may schedule regular magazine activity for the congregation. For most congregations Saturdays will likely be the best time. Second, the brother handling the territory may assign territory solely for magazine witnessing. Most congregations usually find that rotating the territory between magazine witnessing and the literature offer works out well. Therefore, as far as it is practical, individual territories can be worked one time exclusively with the magazines and the next time with the regular literature offer. Third, you may support magazine days, either on a Saturday or on another day during the week convenient to your personal schedule.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>13</sup> What is the objective of magazine days? Their purpose, then and now, goes beyond placements. Magazine days emphasize reaching more </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">people</span><span class="font18"> with the truth. (Prov. 1:20) This was explained in the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font18"> of May 1949, which stated: “The expanded distribution will bring Jehovah’s kingdom more prominently in view, and help increased numbers of the reading public to find hope and life.” Placing magazines, therefore, can be the initial step in starting many </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">people</span><span class="font18"> on the way to a Bible study, which may help them become part of the Christian congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>14</sup> Do not hesitate to share in magazine day activity. Develop a more positive attitude toward magazine witnessing, for “we are not peddlers of the word of God.” (2 Cor. 2:17) In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul had in mind hucksters who watered down wine for a quick sale. Those peddlers were out for their own personal gain and had no concern for either the quality of the goods or the real interests of their customers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>15</sup> False ministers are just like those ancient hucksters, always watering down the Word of God with human philosophies and traditions in order to enhance their own power, prestige and finances. We are different. We are preaching “out of sincerity,” not for personal gain, as “sent from God, under God’s view.” (2 Cor. 2:17) Our magazines are not adulterated but, rather, are spiritually wholesome. Much work and time are invested in each issue. So, take a fresh, positive attitude toward magazine days.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOU</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> CAN DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>1G</sup> First, set a </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">personal goal.</span><span class="font18"> As a suggestion, publishers may have a goal of, say, 10 magazines per month, depending on their circumstances; pioneers might strive for 90. Of course, some publishers may be able to place more magazines per month and therefore will set a higher personal goal. However, because of poor health, type of territory, or other good reasons, the goal of others may be lower. Yet their service to Jehovah is just as worthy. (Matt. 13:23; Luke 21:3, 4) The important thing is to have a personal goal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>17</sup> What do the Society’s branches say about personal goals?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18">• “It is good and stimulating to have goals to reach out for. All pioneers should make purposeful efforts to place some magazines each day.”—Sweden.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• Some publishers who had set goals for themselves on Saturday morning found that they “placed more magazines than they had in the past. Goals do work!”—United States.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• “A pioneer sister aimed to place 100 magazines per month. She increased her regular order of magazines to 120; now she places 160 magazines a month.”—Japan.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>18</sup> Next, have a definite </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">magazine order,</span><span class="font18"> if possible, for each publisher in your family. You may place an order with the brother handling magazines, for a set number of copies of each issue. The result: You and your family will have a regular and adequate supply of magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>19</sup> Then, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">schedule</span><span class="font18"> a definite and regular time for magazine witnessing. It maybe house-to-house witnessing, street witnessing, business witnessing, magazine route witnessing or any combination of the foregoing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>20</sup> Now you are ready to prepare a </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">brief magazine presentation—30</span><span class="font18"> to 60 seconds. You cannot do a lot in 30 to 60 seconds. So aim to say only a little, but say it well. Be enthusiastic. Appeal to the person. Be specific. Pick out one idea from an article, put it into a few pointed words and present the magazines. It has been observed that some publishers may talk too long, talking the householder into taking the magazines and then talking him out of it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>21</sup> Finally, offer the magazines on </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">every appropriate occasion.</span><span class="font18"> “The magazines are not sufficiently offered in informal witnessing,” notes the France branch. And one circuit overseer made this helpful observation: &quot;If publishers would carry magazines with them when they go shopping, visit friends, stop at gas stations, they would find many occasions to place magazines.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>22</sup> Here are some other occasions: When the book offer is refused. When the householder is busy. When we talk to fellow employees or students, neighbors, relatives, people we meet on public transportation or in medical waiting rooms. Can you list any other appropriate occasions?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FEATURE ONE ARTICLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>23</sup> An effective way to arouse the householder’s interest is by raising a question that is answered in an article in one of the magazines. As one branch wrote:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font18">“The best presentation seems to follow the form of raising a subject of interest, usually in the form of a question, pointing to an article in one of the magazines discussing this subject and offering this magazine along with the other as its companion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">You may find this simple approach will be effective in your territory.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>21</sup> Before starting out in magazine witnessing, look over the magazines and pick out a few eyecatching features. Ask yourself: ‘To whom would this article be appealing, a mother, a nonreligious person, a youth?* Think of one or two sentences you could say to prompt a comment from the householder or stir interest.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">STREET WITNESSING IS EFFECTIVE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>25</sup> “I saw three publishers standing on a busy street corner outside the entrance to a restaurant, talking to one another, holding their magazines in the air out in front of them, while scores of people passed right by them,” observed one circuit overseer. Were those publishers effective in street witnessing? Did it seem that they were interested in people, or in just counting their field service time? In some locations and with some publishers, standing still with the magazines exposed has produced good results. But for the majority of publishers, standing in one spot is not the best way to make use of our magazine witnessing time. More than three decades ago the Society offered advice that is still timely:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font18">“Do not stand like a signpost merely holding up the magazines, but walk about the street, offering the magazines to those standing at the curb and to persons in parked cars, also to those walking down the street. Smile, look directly at the person and speak.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>26</sup> Publishers who cluster in groups, either on the street corner or while walking down the street, may find that separating and approaching people, while the other publishers are busy close by, improves their magazine witnessing. Few strangers will approach a group of people, but many strangers will stop and listen briefly if they are approached by only one person.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>27</sup> Here are some more ideas on street witnessing:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font18">• It is good to speak directly to the person, give a friendly greeting, show him one article, and perhaps say: ‘Would this subject interest you?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18">• Some have found that their placements are best and steady when they are at the same place the same time each week. It is also a fact that publishers will meet different groups of people on the streets at different times of the day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• As is true in other features of the field service, we need to be groomed and dressed in a way befitting one of God’s ministers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• Approaching people with the magazine opened to a particular’ article that deals with local problems has been found helpful.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">MAGAZINE ROUTES AND BUSINESS WITNESSING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>28</sup> Magazine routes are excellent stepping-stones to home Bible studies. Have you tried them? When you make regular return visits with the latest magazines, you will find that warmth and friendliness will grow between you and the householder. But some may feel that a magazine route call is to be made ‘when we have nothing else to do.’ A magazine route call is important! It is a return visit when you talk with the same person again.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>29</sup> How do you start a magazine route? You lay the foundation on the first call wherever the magazines are placed. Next, note five simple points on your House-to-House Record. They are (1) householder’s name, (2) address, (3) date of visit, (4) issues placed, (5) article featured. Then you return two weeks later with the latest two magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>30</sup> The following are additional observations:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18">• Those who have magazine routes place many magazines even though the territories are being covered regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• One sister had some exceptional results after taking out a territory for magazine witnessing. In 14 days she had 40 calls on her magazine route. Another sister, by following up all interest shown, was able to add 80 calls to her route. .</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>31</sup> Magazine witnessing to business people in your territory can bring you many good experiences. In giving more attention to the store-to-store work, try to engage in such activity at times when there are not so many people out shopping. It has been found that getting an early start before there are many shoppers on the streets is good because storekeepers are usually more relaxed and not so busy. Be brief, to the point and well dressed. A magazine route may be developed with interested persons found in business territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>32</sup> Our brothers have found these suggestions to be effective when witnessing with magazines:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18">• Read the magazines ahead of time and get to know the articles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• Find an article that deals with a current problem in your community.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• Have one article in mind that will appeal to each of the three categories: men, women, youths.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• Show how the magazine relates to the householder and how the whole family will enjoy it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• Adjust the time of magazine activity so as to meet more people at the door. Some congregations that arrange for evening activity have a very high average of magazine placements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• The most successful presentations are usually short and to the point.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• Don’t talk too fast. If a householder has no interest, your talking faster will not make him interested. Instead, slow down and show personal interest in the householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">• Many magazines are placed with individuals who say that they are busy. To such householders a publisher can simply say: “Instead of my taking time to talk with you, our latest magazines contain our message.” Then offer to leave two magazines for a contribution of 30 cents.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>33</sup> Last year, an insert in </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font18"> for April stressed the importance of obtaining subscriptions. The response was commendable, resulting in a 28-percent worldwide increase in subscriptions, with some countries doubling their previous year’s total. Will we see the same enthusiastic response to the encouragement in this insert to share more fully in witnessing with magazines? If so, our magazines will be pointing many more people to eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Offering Magazines From House to House</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1. Have friendly smile, friendly tone of voice.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">4. Speak on only one subject; briefly stimulate interest in subject and show its value to householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">5. Highlight just one article. It should match your subject and be appropriate for householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">6. Feature only one magazine, offering other as companion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">7. You may find it helpful to hand magazine to householder.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Schedule Time for Field Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>1</sup> True Christians are very busy people. (1 Cor. 15:58) We have many demands placed on our time. Hence, there is a need for us to have a schedule that will enable us to be successful in fulfilling Our many obligations. Particular care and attention, therefore, should be given to our commission to preach, making sure we fully accomplish our ministry.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>2</sup> To help us schedule our time, certain days of the month have been designated as special field service days. These days are highlighted on our calendar. They are the first Sunday and the second and fourth Saturdays of every month. On these special days of service it can be very encouraging for those who may be irregular or inactive to be invited to come along with us. Many use the first Sunday of the month as a day when the whole family shares in the Kingdom-preaching work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>3</sup> Special note, too, should be given to the second and fourth Saturdays of the month. Whereas some may be able to make every Saturday a magazine day, the Society encourages us to make a special effort to engage in the magazine work on these two days. By including these two special magazine days in our schedule, we will be sure of regularly sharing in distributing the magazines. The good that is accomplished by regular participation in magazine work should never be underestimated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>4</sup> When engaging in magazine work, we should recognize that our neighbors are busy too. Saturdays are often used to take care of things around the house or to go shopping. Therefore, a brief presentation stimulating interest in a particular article is appropriate. Our main objective should be to get the magazines and the lifesaving message</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">• District convention badge cards for 1984 will be consigned and included with April literature shipments. It will not be necessary to order these. Consignments in lots of 25 will be made based on the size of each congregation, and the literature account will be billed at the rate of one cent per card. This new uniform arrangement will represent a considerable saving of work, time and expense for the Society. It should be more convenient for the congregations and ensure the availability of convention badge cards for all the publishers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SET PERSONAL GOALS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>5</sup> To aid further in scheduling time, have you set personal goals for yourself? Personal goals to increase time spent in the ministry, to place more literature or to make more effective return visits will help us set priorities. This may mean that some activities of lesser importance will<sup>1 </sup>have to be put aside. However, the results to be obtained are well worth the time and effort required to reach personal goals. Not only will we gain a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, but more importantly we will be putting Kingdom interests first.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>6</sup> Our lives as true Christians revolve around our privilege of preaching the good news. Hence, any day of the week that is convenient may be scheduled for preaching work. Many schedule service every Saturday and Sunday, and this is good. However, others may not be able to do this. Therefore, by reserving the first Sunday and the second and fourth Saturdays of the month as special field service days, they too will have a definite minimum schedule for field service each month.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">’ “The time left is reduced.” (1 Cor. 7:29) This being the case, our lives should be filled with Christian works. To accomplish this, our time for engaging in the preaching activity should be placed high on our priority list in order to maintain a healthy, zealous participation in the ministry.</span></p>

They realize that they too owe their salvation to God and to the Lamb. (Rev. 7:9, 10) So this great crowd find delight in assembling with the spiritual remnant on that night to memorialize the death of the Lamb of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>6</sup> All who attend can benefit greatly. It is an occasion to recount the love that Jehovah God displayed in giving his Son as a ransom. All are reminded of the depth of Jesus’ own love in laying down his life for us, as well as the fine example he set for his followers. (John 15:12, 13; 1 Cor. 15:3; 1 Pet. 2:21) All of us will benefit greatly by preparing now and being present on April 15 for the celebration of the Memorial of Christ’s death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">To People Who Speak Another Language</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>1</sup> Today, it is not uncommon to find various language groups intermingled in metropolitan or urban areas. To some extent this may be true in certain rural areas as well. People who speak other languages must also be reached with the message of the Kingdom. (Rev. 14:6) In view of the various situations and problems that arise in accomplishing our ministry with those who speak other languages, the following suggestions are made.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MAKE DISCIPLES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>2</sup> It is good to keep foremost in mind that as we preach, our purpose is to make disciples—to teach the truth. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Teaching should be done in the language people understand best. (1 Cor. 14:9) However, this is not always possible. In many areas there is but one congregation exclusively working the territory, yet people who are not conversant in the local language live there. What can be done to help these people learn the truth?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>3</sup> If you call on someone who speaks a language other than your own, make good use of the booklet </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Good News for All Nations.</span><span class="font17"> In that way at least a basic witness can be given to determine if the individual has some interest in the truth. If he shows interest and you have literature in his language, offer it to him. Thereafter, inquire of the elders and perhaps the circuit overseer as to whether there is a group or congregation within a reasonable distance that holds meetings in the language of the householder. Someone from the group or congregation may be able to provide assistance. If this is not practical, then perhaps a local publisher who speaks the language could be found to follow up on the interest. Sign language calls shduld be given the same consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>4</sup> However, it may be that there are no Witnesses in the general area who speak the language of the interested person. What can be done in this instance? Some publishers have partially overcome the language barrier by using the brochure </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!</span><span class="font17"> If it is published in the language of the individual, so much the better. By using the illustrations and having the person read the Scriptures cited in the Bible, he will get some basic Bible understanding. In some cases there may be members of the interested person’s family who know enough of the local language to serve as interpreters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>5</sup> In areas where there are no meetings held in a language the householder understands, encourage him to attend the meetings of the local congregation. The Christian association itself can be very upbuilding; and in order for him to make further spiritual progress he can start to learn the local language. (Matt. 18:20) Keep in mind that our purpose is to make disciples.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WORKING MULTILINGUAL TERRITORY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>6</sup> In some areas there are two, three or more congregations that have the same geographical territory assignment but are of different languages. Where this is the case, the publishers of each congregation should concentrate their efforts on their own particular language group. Obviously, there will be some overlapping of efforts at times. However, bodies of elders and congregations in such areas have been able to cooperate closely in serving the needs of the people, reaching them with the good news in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">language they best understand.</span><span class="font17"> One way this is done is by passing along to the appropriate congregation the addresses of persons who speak another language. (Phil. 2:4) Also, the publishers in each congregation should be aware of the fact that the territory assignments in such areas are according to language. Hence, all should be conscientious about the way in which the territory is worked. Homes of individuals who understand best the language of one of the congregations holding the territory should be left for the publishers of that congregation to visit. By following this suggestion, those placing literature will be able to follow through and direct the interest to the appropriate congregation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">’ In some places it has proved to be practical for congregations to maintain a list of addresses and apartment numbers of those who prefer to speak a particular language. Other congregations in the same area may list the homes or apartments that their publishers should not work. This helps to avoid unnecessary calls by publishers from different congregations. In other places congregations work out a system among themselves to work the territory thoroughly and to direct interested ones to the appropriate congregation. This too is agreeable with the Society since there is no rigid rule on how this must be done. —1 Cor. 14:33, 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>8</sup> Much can be accomplished in preaching the good news to people who speak another language when everyone cooperates, displaying reasonableness and unselfish interest in the Lord's sheep. (John 13:34, 35; Phil. 2:14; Jas. 3:17, 18) By keeping foremost in mind the spiritual well-being of the sheeplike ones in the territory and our purpose of making disciples, we may yet help many more people of all nations and languages to join with us in worshiping Jehovah.—Isa. 2:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Auxiliary Pioneer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d}</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">auxiliary pioneer for a month they usually accomplish more at home as well as in the field. There is general agreement that our relationship with Jehovah is enriched by means of the increased activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">♦ The congregation benefits too. Some who may be hesitant to enter auxiliary pioneer service alone will do so if encouraged by another. Others who may not be able to auxiliary pioneer would still like to increase their service activity and they can do this by working with those who are auxiliary pioneers. The pioneer spirit, having a right mental attitude about full-time service, can permeate the congregation when brothers and sisters happily support this special activity. It has been said that the spiritual well-being of a congregation is closely related to its activity in the field ministry. Hence, when elders take the lead both by encouraging auxiliary pioneer service and by sharing in it when they can, the entire congregation benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>8</sup> People to whom we preach benefit from our increased service. On the initial call or on return visits pioneers are able to start more home Bible studies that can put some on the road to life. More literature is usually distributed in the territory, and that means a greater opportunity for sheeplike ones to learn the truth. Genuine effort is made to seek out those who are sighing and groaning over world conditions. People are being duly warned about God’s impending judgment, and our responsibility to carry out this work is more fully accomplished. (Ezek. 9:4; 33:7-9) The name of Jehovah and the message about the Kingdom are kept more fully before the people so that they will know ‘that a prophet himself has proved to be in the midst of them.’—Ezek. 33:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAN NOW TO AUXILIARY PIONEER IN APRIL!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>6</sup> For those who can make room for it, the auxiliary pioneer activity is a fine way to have a greater share in the field ministry in April. Besides holidays during the month of April, which will leave many with time off from school and secular work, there are five Sundays. Perhaps even some in full-time secular work can auxiliary pioneer by making good use of evenings, Saturdays and the five Sundays. Make your plans now for increased service during April!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Hope Despite World Distress Since 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 24:7—Jesus foretold world distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 24:13—He also said some will be saved.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“Work What Is Good Toward All”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul wrote: “Really, then, as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) Do you not agree that now is the favorable time for zealous Kingdom service? (Compare John 9:4.) These are the last days; theocratic expansion is taking place everywhere, and potential for further increase is no doubt indicated in your congregation’s recent Memorial attendance. —Isa. 60:22; Mark 13:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> But what specifically is the activity that will allow us to “work what is good toward all”? When and for whom should we do that work? How can we rejoice and work for the good of all?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A GOOD WORK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> From the very beginning of his heavenly existence, God’s Son, a master worker, set the example for us, working hard for the benefit of others. He always took delight in doing Jehovah’s will. (Prov. 8: 22-31; Ps. 40:8) Later, his own words expressed his appreciation for the Christian ministry: “My food is for me to do the will of</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A Time Both “to Rejoice and to Do Good”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ Solomon’s words at Ecclesiastes 3:12 are part of his inspired comments on “a time for every affair under the heavens.” (Eccl. 3:1) He points out that our Creator wants us to work hard and enjoy to the full the good results of our labors. But in today’s world where many have become obsessed with recreation and pleasure seeking, it is vital for Christians to guard against becoming involved in the kind of rejoicing that is promoted by the spirit of the world. Balance and reasonableness are necessary if we are to keep clearly in focus our theocratic activities, while enjoying wholesome moments of relaxation and recreation. How may this be done during the spring and summer months?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> For many people spring and summer mean vacation time. Pleasant weather and longer daylight hours are conducive to being outdoors and generally afford more recreational opportunities. There are various wholesome activities to delight us. But care needs to him that sent me and to finish his work.&quot; (John 4:34) The preaching work he started during his earthly ministry is a most worthwhile work for us to do.—John 14:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">♦ There is much of that good work yet to be done. (Matt. 9:37, 38; 10: 11-13; 28:19, 20) Millions of people need help to understand God’s Word and to do his will. Therefore, let us work hard at this ministry for the good of all, and rejoice because we are privileged to share in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> The Topic for Conversation and literature offer for May are the same as for last month. People need hope, which means they need to know the significance of the distresses the world is experiencing. Therefore, it undoubtedly will be effective to initiate conversations on the thought “Hope Despite World Distress Since 1914.” Also, offering the subscription to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> for a contribution of $3.50 can be the first step in a chain of events in our working what is good for others. At times you may want to include </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> and offer both subscriptions for $7.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">be exercised. We should not neglect, even temporarily, a regular schedule of meeting attendance and field service. Theocratic activities are fundamental to our happiness. (Matt. 5:3) During the spring and summer months we also want to take advantage of occasions to enjoy extra privileges of service that may not be open to us during the rest of the year. Many have found that auxiliary pioneering satisfies both spiritual and recreational needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> One sister who spent an entire summer auxiliary pioneering in unassigned territory said: “It was an unforgettable experience. I will always remember the spiritual education I received, not to mention other benefits.” Entire families have found joy by taking advantage of opportunities to increase their service to Jehovah. One family of nine spent their vacation period in a small town that had seldom received a witness. Part of each day was spent in the preaching work</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Have you recently given thought to your schedule for field service? Are you making full use of your opportunities to share in the important work Jehovah God has given us to do? (Eph. 5:15-17) No doubt, with a little planning, most of us can share in field service every week this month. Cem you serve as an auxiliary pioneer anytime soon? All of us should consider seriously what we are doing individually and as family groups to use this favorable time we now have to preach, working for the good of all and rejoicing in Jehovah’s service.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1984 “Kingdom Increase” District Convention</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">In writing to the congregation of Thessaioni-ca, the apostle Paul entreated fellow believers to pray for him and his companion workers “that the word of Jehovah may keep moving speedily and being glorified.&quot; (2 Thess. 3:1) Like the first-century Christians, it is our earnest desire that Bible truths continue to influence honest-hearted people and move them to embrace “the word of Jehovah.&quot; This is happening today. Many have escaped from satanic influence and have sought refuge in Jehovah’s theocratic organization. We rejoice that 161,896 such honest-hearted ones were baptized during the last service year. And 6,767,707 attended the Memorial in 1983. How thrilling! Yes, there is every reason to believe that Jehovah will bless us with further increase before the conclusion of this system. (Isa. 60:22) How appropriate then is the theme “Kingdom Increase&quot; for the 1984 district conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The nation of Israel regularly assembled in worship of Jehovah. During such gatherings they learned more about their God. This is reflected in the words of Deuteronomy 31:12: “Congregate the people, the men and the women and the little ones ... in order that they may listen and in order that they may learn, as they must fear Jehovah.” Our purpose in assembling is the same. We want to listen and learn about Jehovah. That is why we, as worshipers of Jehovah, along with other interested persons are looking forward with keen anticipation to the “Kingdom Increase” District Conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Attending will take time and money. But the returns will be of far greater value. (Eph. 5: 15-17) No doubt many have fond memories of past conventions, recalling the love and unity that marked such occasions. What a blessing it will be once again to take full advantage of the opportunity to incite one another “to love and fine works.” (Heb. 10:24, 25) Your determination to attend, coupled with careful planning, will enable you to share this occasion with the increasing throngs now rendering praise to our God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ATTEND ALL FOUR DAYS: </span><span class="font15">Do not miss even a portion of the theocratic meal served by “the faithful and discreet slave,&quot; from the opening session on Thursday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. until the concluding prayer on Sunday afternoon. Of course, this may require some adjustments in your work schedule, but you can be confident that Jehovah will richly bless your efforts. With faith in Jehovah, make arrangements to attend all four days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Endeavor to arrive early for each session. This will afford you the opportunity to enjoy the “interchange of encouragement&quot; that comes when congregating with fellow Christians. (Rom. 1:12) Careful planning and foresight will help you to arrive before the session starts and thus avoid distracting others. Sadly, some are habitual latecomers. This is disrespectful and may indicate a lack of proper regard for spiritual things. Of course, on occasion, problems may arise that will prevent us from being on time. But Christian love and consideration will prompt us to make every effort possible to start out early enough each day so that we do not miss any part of the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The insert in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font15"> for January 1984 provided helpful information about rooming accommodations and listed the convention dates and locations. Once again we ask your cooperation in attending the convention to which your circuit is assigned. The Society has done considerable planning and work to see that sufficient seating, literature, food, and so forth, are provided for everyone. Some may understandably be faced with extenuating circumstances, such as prearranged vacation dates that cannot be changed or the need to assist relatives living in another area. However, if a concerted effort is made to cooperate with the suggestions given, good success will result and overcrowding will be prevented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY BE IN ATTENDANCE: </span><span class="font15">Each year we look forward with eager anticipation to being present at the district convention. But why is this event such a highlight for us? Because it affords the opportunity to </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">“listen</span><span class="font15"> and take in more instruction.” (Prov. 1:5) We also find enjoyment in being with a large group of our brothers, renewing old friendships and sharing experiences. However, never let us forget that our main reason for attending is to receive instruction from Jehovah. —Ezek. 34:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Some positive reports have been received regarding improvements in our attentiveness at the convention. From one convention city came the report: “All sat quietly listening, and practically none were moving around during the program.” From a city in the Middle West the conventioners were described as “a most respectful and courteous audience, getting to their seats on request and paying rapt attention. ... It was clear that the brothers appreciated the purpose of the convention.” And from another came this comment: “Outstanding was the attentiveness of the audience. . . . The opening talks had an excellent effect on their paying attention.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">This was not true in all cases though. One stadium worker was overheard saying to one of our younger brothers, &quot;You don’t seem to be respecting the program because I see you walking around here all the time.’ So we still need to give</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, MAY 1984</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">some attention to the primary reason we attend the conventions each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Imagine being invited to someone’s house for dinner and you know a sumptuous feast will be served. As you travel to the house you are eagerly anticipating the many tasty dishes that are sure to be served. Upon arriving and entering the house, would you then ignore the food and occupy yourself with touring around the house and surrounding area, chatting with fellow guests while eating little, if any, of the meal? How inconsiderate and foolish that would be. And yet that, in effect, is how some act toward the yearly spiritual feast to which we have been invited by the Great Provider of all good things, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Admittedly it may not be easy for some to sit for extended periods and concentrate on a steady flow of Scriptural instruction. You may feel tired or have active children to care for. You may at times encounter other noises and distractions that could draw your attention away from the information coming from the platform. There is also the danger of letting your mind drift to other thoughts and concerns. What can be done? Concentration and active listening are essential. Jesus advised: “Pay attention to how you listen.” (Luke 8:18) This takes effort and self-control. Some have got involved in conversing with others during the sessions. But would this not be disrespectful of Jehovah’s provision? Jehovah told Job when instructing him: “Listen to me! Keep silent.” (Job 33:31, 33) So likewise, could we not apply this same counsel to ourselves while the convention program is in progress?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Do not make the mistake of concluding that you do not have to concentrate too intensely, assuming that the material will all come out in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> anyway. Some of the talks may be printed later in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font15"> but this is not the case with all of them. Valuable information will be lost if, at the time it is presented, it is not absorbed through careful listening and moderate note-taking. A particular talk may not contain new material but will present a Scriptural thought from a different angle. Or the material may refine our understanding of a certain scripture and enhance our appreciation of a familiar subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The taking of notes, if done selectively, can help us to retain the material. This is true even if the notes are not consulted at some future time. Accordingly, you will want to take along a note pad and use it. There is not enough room on the back of the convention program to take notes on all the information presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">An article in </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Human Behavior</span><span class="font15"> magazine related an experiment conducted at the University of New Mexico that confirms the value of notetaking. Two researchers asked 83 students to listen to a lecture. Some took notes on the lecture, and some were handed notes prepared by the lecturer at the conclusion of the lecture. A third group had no notes at all. After a ten-minute review they were tested. The students who took their own notes scored highest. Taking notes helps to keep your mind active and impresses the information more deeply on heart and mind. Note-taking helps to block out disturbances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The introduction to study 5 of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook</span><span class="font15"> makes this important statement: “Your progress as a minister of Jehovah is dependent to a considerable extent on how you listen.” Listening with the object of gaining knowledge is an art, a skill that can be developed. Why not practice being an alert listener, one who hears with thoughtful attention, so that you will gain the most benefit from the four-day “Kingdom Increase” District Convention soon to start in your area? It will probably cost you both time and money to be in attendance, so try to gain the greatest benefit from your investment by intently listening to all that is said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FINE CONDUCT: </span><span class="font15">At one time or another have you not been favorably impressed by the conduct of fellow Witnesses in contrast with that of people in general? It may have been their kindness and patience while waiting in line, their consideration of others in traffic, the chastity and modesty reflected by their dress and grooming, the genuine respect shown parents and other older ones, the loving and persistent training of youth, or the kind expressions of appreciation for services rendered. Yes, Jehovah’s Witnesses stand out as being different from worldly people, and last year many favorable comments were made about our conduct at conventions. One local resident living next to a large sports complex noted the difference between gatherings held by Jehovah’s Witnesses and various other events. After relating how litter and traffic jams characterized a loud rock concert, he said: “Almost all events in the dome have created problems. The only event that did not was the Jehovah’s Witnesses convention.” A general manager of another stadium volunteered this comment: “Of all the many types and sizes of crowds attending events at the stadium, your group has been by far the cleanest, best behaved and most cooperative.” Still others tell of the cooperative and caring spirit shown by our brothers and sisters at the conventions. It is pleasing to receive such fine commendation from onlookers, is it not? But more importantly, our conduct reflects favorably upon our Christian training and brings honor to God’s name. —1 Pet. 1:15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Nevertheless, we would be remiss if some areas needing improvement were not here mentioned. The matter of conduct while staying in motels or hotels is one of them. We are still receiving reports that indicate a need to give closer attention to our conduct and that of our children. Some managers still complain that children and teenagers are noisy and unruly, being unsupervised by their parents while using the swimming pool and other facilities. Additionally some brothers have broken rules in regard to cooking in rooms. Some motel owners tell us this is a common abuse of their facilities. Not only have they had the rooms physically damaged, but the lingering odors prevented them from renting the rooms for days or weeks afterward. Unless the cooking of food is specifically permitted, it should </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">not be done.</span><span class="font15"> A real effort should be made to cooperate fully with the management. Certainly we do not want to leave an unfavorable opinion of Jehovah’s people. Whether at the convention site or while staying at the various motels or hotels, we should at all times reflect righteous standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A few reminders about dress and grooming would also be appropriate at this time. Frequently the buildings chosen for our district conventions are normally used for sports and recreational purposes. But we are there for a much higher purpose, to worship Jehovah and learn of better ways to serve him. It is often true that a person will act and think in accord with how he is dressed. If we are dressed casually, as at a picnic or an outing, is it not quite possible that this will have some influence on our conduct and attentiveness? Some conventions have reported that the dress and grooming of some are not what you would expect to find at a gathering for the lofty purpose of worshiping the Most High. Good Scriptural counsel that covers the matters of cleanness, dress and grooming can be found on pages 130, 131, 135 and 136 of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font15"> book. We should always strive to “do all things for God’s glory.” (1 Cor. 10:31) It would be helpful to review the May 1981 </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font15"> insert for additional reminders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Another area that continues to need attention is the excessive saving of seats. Various approaches have been made to deal with this problem, but nothing substitutes for the basic Christian quality of love. Love will prevent us from being inattentive to the needs of the elderly, infirm and all others. (Luke 6:31) Also, there are times when, due to unforeseen developments, more attend a convention than anticipated, and overcrowding results. Whenever there is a measure of neglect or thoughtlessness on the part of someone, others are inconvenienced or distracted from the real purpose for our being assembled. When the attendants are instructed to remove personal belongings from unoccupied seats, is your reaction one of irritation or anger? How we react to such situations may indicate to what extent our Christian personality has been developed. Remember that many attending the conventions are not Jehovah’s Witnesses. There is compelling reason, then, to ‘maintain our conduct fine among the nations’ to prevent others from being stumbled. —1 Pet. 2:12; Matt. 18:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">We have been informed that in many states baby strollers may </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font15"> be used in places of public assembly. Fire regulations prohibit parking them in aisles, rows and corridors. Since large crowds may cause congested conditions, baby strollers are dangerous, not only to the baby but also to any who may trip or stumble over them. However, car or infant seats are permissible, since these can be placed in seats next to the parents. Your cooperation in this matter will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS: </span><span class="font15">Field service has long been a special feature of our summer conventions. During the 1922 Cedar Point convention a “Service Day” was set aside for a special effort in the field. This year, too, all are urged to make plans to share in the ministry. Friday afternoon has been set aside for that purpose. Can you have a share? The program is scheduled to conclude around 3:00 p.m. Be sure to make your arrangements for territory or to be included in a group having territory </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font15"> the Friday afternoon session begins. It would also be the course of practical wisdom for the group captain to learn the route to the territory at the time the territory card is obtained so as not to lose time in locating the territory on Friday afternoon. Magazines, literature and other needed supplies should be brought with you from your congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font15">“This assembly has been most unbelievable. I cannot believe that you people can get so much work done with untrained volunteers. It has made quite an impression on us.” This was the comment made by one assistant stadium manager last year at the conclusion of the convention held in his city. Of course, our reason for volunteering to work is to serve our brothers and help make the convention a success. Some may recall in years past that much of the program was missed by volunteers because they worked even during convention sessions. Now, however, the various departments are organized in such a way that those volunteering their services should be able to hear most, if not all, of the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Why not give some thought now to volunteering to help for a few hours in one of the convention departments? Maybe you can do this as a family or with others from your congregation. As has been true in the past, volunteers need to be at least 16 years old, unless accompanied by a parent or another responsible adult volunteer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOOD NEEDS: </span><span class="font15">Special arrangements are being made to care for our physical needs. Provisions for food and drink will be similar to what has been available at district conventions in recent years. Are we not grateful for the loving labors of our brothers and sisters who work hard in serving us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Convention tickets will be available at the cost of $1.00 per sheet of ten. It is suggested that you purchase these in advance through your congregation. Purchase enough tickets to supply your family’s food needs for the first two or three days of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">What a joy it will be to assemble with our brothers and interested persons to take in accurate knowledge of Jehovah at the “Kingdom Increase” District Conventions. Will you be among the hundreds of thousands in attendance this year? Hopefully the information presented herein will help you to finalize your plans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Jehovah is speeding up the Kingdom work, and as the increase continues worldwide, it should be our sincere desire to help these sheeplike ones to advance to maturity. The “Kingdom Increase” District Conventions will better equip us for this important work, while strengthening our resolve to serve God wholeheartedly. Let it be our prayer “that the word of Jehovah may keep moving speedily and being glorified,” all to his praise. —2 Thess. 3:1.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>District Convention Reminders</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING: </span><span class="font14">Your cooperation in using the listing of accommodations provided by the'convention in selecting your rooms is very much appreciated. If you have not already made a reservation and forwarded a deposit, it is necessary to do so immediately if you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city. Congregation convention coordinators should be sure that Special Needs Room Request Forms have been promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you find it necessary to cancel your accommodations selected from the listing, you should write or phone the hotel/motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should notify both the landlord or hotel/motel and the convention Rooming Department so that the room may be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The convention Rooming Department will provide, upon your request, available information on any commercial trailer or camping facilities in the convention area. Please include a selfaddressed, stamped envelope with your request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">BAPTISM: </span><span class="font14">At most locations, the talk for baptismal candidates will be on Saturday morning. Those who wish to symbolize their dedication by water baptism should have reviewed the questions with elders in their congregation prior to the convention. A modest bathing suit and a towel should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font14">It is the course of wisdom and shows appreciation to be in our seats when the program begins. That will be 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, 9:30 a.m. on Friday and 9:40 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday at most conventions. The same fine qualities are displayed when we do not plan to leave before the sessions conclude. The closing song and prayer will be at 5:10 p.m. on Thursday. Friday afternoon will be set aside for a special effort in field service, following the closing song and prayer at 3:00 p.m. On Saturday the closing song and prayer are scheduled at 5:00 p.m. and on Sunday at 4:10 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">BETHEL AND GILEAD MEETINGS: </span><span class="font14">A meeting will be held on Friday for pioneers between the ages of 20 and 40 who are interested in attending Gilead School to receive training for missionary service. There will be a meeting on Saturday for any dedicated publishers between 19 and 35 years of age who are U.S. residents and who would like to enter Bethel service. Check the program at the convention city for the exact times and locations of these meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font14">All </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">regular </span><span class="font14">and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">special</span><span class="font14"> pioneers as well as traveling overseers will need to bring their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card (S-202) to the convention. Those on the list for six months at the time of the district convention they attend may receive $15 worth of convention tickets upon presentation of their Watchtower ID card at that one convention only. Treat the card as carefully as cash. It cannot be replaced at the convention. Any free releases or other literature at pioneer rates will be available to pioneers at the bookroom only, upon showing their Watchtower ID card. Those in Bethel service may obtain any free releases or other literature at pioneer rates at the bookroom by showing their Bethel ID card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">LAPEL CARDS: </span><span class="font14">These cards are provided as a means of advertising the convention as well as to facilitate identifying our brothers and sisters in attendance. To this end, please </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">wear</span><span class="font14"> the specially designed lapel card at the convention and also while traveling to and from the convention site. Not only is the card a fine means of identification, but it so often results in giving a fine witness while traveling. You should obtain these through your congregation as they will </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font14"> be available at the conventions. The lapel cards are 1c each and the plastic holders are 10c each. (Lapel cards have already been consigned to each congregation by the Society, but the plastic holders must be ordered by the congregation.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font14">Regardless of where you park, you should lock your vehicle at </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font14">times and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font14"> leave anything visible inside. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk, if possible. Also, guard against thieves and pickpockets who are attracted by large gatherings. This includes not leaving anything of value unattended on seats at the conventions. Additionally, it has been reported that there is a greater risk of falls on stairs and ramps when sisters are wearing high-heeled shoes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">• No break is scheduled for Congregation Book Studies during the convention week. However, the material scheduled for that week may be split so that half of it is studied the week prior to the convention and the other half the week following, in addition to the material scheduled for those particular weeks. If necessary, the reading of the paragraphs may be omitted during these two studies. • Selective service regulations require that all men register for the draft when reaching 18 years of age. All of those required to do so should take care of this matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind when young brothers are nearing the age of 18 and give them appropriate reminders. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders. • New Publications Available:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Regularity in Service Brings Blessings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> There are many things we must do regularly in order to care for our physical well-being. If these are neglected, there are consequences we will suffer. In like manner, if we fail to satisfy our spiritual needs regularly, our faith can become weak and we may become irregular in our theocratic activity. Do we attend meetings regularly and maintain a personal study schedule that keeps us spiritually strong and equipped to be effective ministers of the good news? (2 Tim. 3:16, 17; 2 Cor. 3: 5, 6) Do we take positive steps to share in the Held service on a regular basis?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> The psalmist wrote: “From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.” (Ps. 96:2) Many of us may not share in field service each day, but would it not be reasonable to schedule some time for the ministry </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">each week</span><span class="font14"> if at all possible? Although Paul recognized that to “declare the good news” was a “necessity” for him, he also declared the good news of the Kingdom eagerly. (1 Cor. 9:16; Rom. 1:15) Do we not also view sharing in the ministry each week as both a necessity and a grand privilege? Do we feel as did Peter and John who emphatically declared, “We cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard&quot;?—Acts 4:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> For various reasons some of our brothers have allowed entire months to pass without spending even one hour in field service. This is a cause for concern because only if we exercise faith by sharing the good news with others can we expect to maintain spiritual strength. (Rom. 10: 9, 10) As a muscle requires regular use to stay strong, so likewise our faith needs to be exercised in order to remain firm. By continually talking to others about the Kingdom, we keep the truth firmly embedded in our hearts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Another reason for making public expression of our faith on a regular basis is that it serves as a protection, a bulwark, against Satan’s unrelenting efforts to pierce our spiritual armor with his burning missiles. (Eph. 6:16) Through lack of use and care, armor can rust and cease to serve as a protection. After itemizing our</span></p></li></ul>

Mark your order: BRAILLE DESK. protective armor, Paul urges: “Also, accept . . . the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word.&quot; (Eph. 6:17) This is without doubt an unbeatable combination—spiritual protective armor and the sword of the spirit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Each congregation lovingly endeavors to offer personal assistance to those who, for various reasons, do not participate in field service on a regular basis. (Eph. 4:11-15) Each month the congregation secretary should provide each book study conductor with a list of those in his group who have not reported field service activity. Study conductors will do their part by giving particular attention to the spiritual needs of these, offering personally to assist them in the ministry or arranging for someone else to do so. And, of course, the service overseer, working through the study conductors, will take the lead in helping to reduce irregularity in the congregation. Never forget that each of us has a personal responsibility before Jehovah to have a regular share in the work to which we have been assigned.—Compare Psalm 61:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Many blessings come to us if we steadfastly hold to a schedule that allows us to participate in the field ministry regularly. We will enjoy better results because regularity in field service helps develop skill in presenting the message. The happiness this brings makes us want to reach out for additional privileges. You may be one who can make room for auxiliary pioneering and, in time, regular pioneer service. Brothers who have a good share in the field ministry each month may, in time, be invited to accept additional responsibility in the congregation. Truly, regularity in field service does bring blessings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">’ By unitedly working “from day to day” to finish the work Jehovah has assigned, we will experience the joy that comes from giving and we will develop the spiritual fortitude required to endure to the end.—Acts 20:35; Matt. 24:13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">POINTS TO REMEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">’ Magazine presentations should be kept simple and brief. Being well acquainted with the magazines will enable ydu to be sincere and enthusiastic. While both magazines are offered, it is usually best to emphasize one theme and tie in the article you are featuring. When placements are made, endeavor to obtain the person’s name and arrange for a return visit, with a view to starting a magazine route. If the magazine offer is refused, be friendly and leave the person in a good frame of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Remember, the magazines we offer have “sayings of everlasting life.” (John 6:68) We should not be hesitant in offering them. Present them with zeal and enthusiasm.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">and part in some form of recreation. They commented: “It was the most delightful vacation we have ever had!” Could you arrange to auxiliary pioneer at least once during the spring and summer? Young ones out of school for the summer may want to set this as a goal for one month or more. Parents, why not work right along with them in this fine avenue of sacred service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> This summer will not be complete without attending the “Kingdom Increase” District Convention, and thus many are planning their vacations in conjunction with this spiritual event. Good judgment is again needed. Time should not be spent in our enjoyment of recreational or other activities at the expense of even a part of the convention. We want to enjoy all four days, as this is a spiritual highlight of the year. Sharing in the field ministry following the session on Friday afternoon will be very rewarding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Have relatives in the truth invited you to spend part of your vacation visiting them? This may be a good way to relax and share various experiences. For others, vacation time may include visiting unbelieving relatives. If circumstances permit, why not share our Bible-based hope with them? When vacationing away from home, if at all possible, attend the meetings of the local congregation. It is especially encouraging to share with them in the field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Certainly there are many things to look forward to this spring and summer. Remember to ‘seek first the Kingdom.’ (Matt. 6:33) As we continue to ‘rejoice and do good,’ our speech and conduct will reflect favorably upon our loving Creator. This will be to his praise and our great reward.—Ps. 34:1; Eccl. 3: 12, 13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Guarding Our Christian Trust</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">‘At 2 Timothy 1:13, 14 the apostle Paul admonished his fellow worker: “Keep holding the pattern of healthful words that you heard from me with the faith and love that are in connection with Christ Jesus. This fine trust guard through the holy spirit which is dwelling in us.” What is a trust? It is something of value that is committed to the care of a person who must eventually render an account. What was the trust mentioned by Paul? He identified it as “the pattern of healthful words” or what we today usually refer to as the truth. Obviously Paul wanted Timothy to have a deep appreciation for the truth. So he referred to it as a “fine trust.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Did Paul mean that the Christian trust consisted of just a knowledge of the truth? No, it included also the ministry associated with the truth. These “healthful words” needed to be preached both inside and outside of the congregation. Concerning such preaching, Paul said: “Preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season.” Then he added: “Do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.” (2 Tim. 4:2, 5) Christians today</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1984 Yearbook</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Highlights Worldwide Increase</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When you read the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">1981/ Yearbook,</span><span class="font12"> you will be thrilled with the annual report on the worldwide activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses. What joy is ours just to see the tangible results of Jehovah’s rich blessing on the united efforts of his dedicated people during the 1983 service year!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Long ago Isaiah spoke prophetically about our times and described what we are privileged to experience today. In words of praise to Jehovah he said: “You have made the nation populous; for it you have made the rejoicing great.” (Isa. 9:3) Then in that same verse he proceeded to highlight further the great rejoicing on the part of Jehovah’s people, saying: “They have rejoiced before you as with the rejoicing in the harvesttime, as those who are joyful when they divide up the spoil.” These words of Isaiah remind us of what Jesus said about a ready harvest and the need for workers in the field.—Matt. 9: 35-38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The report shows that on an average 2,501,722 publishers were active throughout the year and that cherish both the knowledge and the ministry of the truth. They want to guard that Christian trust well.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">EFFORT REQUIRED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Guarding our Christian trust is not easy. True, in some places you may find yourself preaching under advantageous circumstances. By all means exert yourself fully in such a good climate in order to reach as many people as possible. But in other territories, where the brothers preach under difficult circumstances, they are required to adjust to that situation. While encouraging and protecting one another, with God’s backing they see to it that the preaching and teaching work moves ahead. (Phil. 4:13) Our Christian trust must be guarded under all circumstances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> If we are truly interested in guarding our Christian trust, we will be serious about keeping up with the truth and will strive to use the best methods in presenting it to others. The thorough consideration we gave to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book at the Congregation Book Study has been a real help. We now have a better appreciation of its contents and can thus more enthu-</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col.</span><span class="font12"> 5) we reached a new peak of 2,652,323. Both of these figures represent a 7-percent increase over the 1982 service year. And just think —there was an influx of 161,896 newly baptized ministers of the Kingdom, a 17-percent increase over the preceding year!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah’s people have taken seriously the apostle Paul’s admonition always ‘to have plenty to do in the work of the Lord,’ and this is reflected in a 14-percent increase in total hours in field service. This time was well spent in effective witnessing as is indicated by other related increases. Total literature placements increased by 12 percent! Subscriptions soared by 28 percent! How thrilled we are to have had a share in this ministry of the good news and now to have a record of the results!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Much of the overall accomplishment in the field during the 1983 service year can be attributed to the fact that on an average there were 206,098 pioneer ministers reporting field service each month. This is a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 8, col. 1}</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">30 min: Neutrality Toward Political Affairs. Consideration of material in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font12"> brochure, pages 12-16, under the subject of “Flag Salute, Anthems and Voting.” Have a well-prepared, qualified elder handle this. It is important for us to have our Scriptural position on these issues clearly in mind. Consider the openihg portion of this section of the brochure by means of a talk. Jesus’ example and his teachings set the pattern for all Christians, including youths. Consider the significance of John 6:15; 17:16 and 18:36. Also, consider what the textbooks say about the neutral position of early Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Allow sufficient time to discuss the material under the subheadings “The Flag Salute,” “National Anthems and School Songs,” and “Elective Offices and Positions.&quot; Draw attention to the sound Scriptural basis for not saluting and not singing in connection with patriotic services. Help the brothers to reason on whether it is Scriptur-ally proper to stand or not to stand for patriotic services on certain occasions. Reason with the brothers as to why it is appropriate that Witness youths keep free from school politics. Loyalty to God’s organization is shown by such conformity. Highlight such matters in the discussion. The material, after the opening talk, could be handled principally by questions and answers.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>1984 “Kingdom Increase” District Convention</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The little one himself will become a thousand ...”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Do not those prophetic words of Isaiah thrill and inspire us? They surely do! Jehovah’s prophet went on to say that ‘the small one will become a mighty nation. I myself, Jehovah, shall speed it up in its own time.’ (Isa. 60:22) These are exciting times in view of the growth within Jehovah’s organization. Hence, the theme “Kingdom Increase” is most appropriate and sparks in us the desire to attend the 1984 district conventions. Last summer in the contiguous United States an all-time peak attendance of 1,124,070 was reached. Think of the privilege of being a part of the even larger attendance expected for over 100 “Kingdom Increase” District Conventions planned for this summer, and of hearing how Jehovah is speeding up the Kingdom work and about the share we each can have in it before the end comes. To assist you in making necessary arrangements to be in attendance, you will find a list of these conventions on page 6. The following information should help you to arrange to be there and to assist others, especially newly interested ones, to attend every session as well.—Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SELECTING YOUR CONVENTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Listed on page 6, in date order, is each convention city and the circuits (or portions thereof) assigned to attend each convention. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, you should attend the convention to which your circuit is assigned. Where two or more conventions are being held at the same location, you should attend on the dates shown for your circuit or portion thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Those circuits in the chart marked with an asterisk (*) have some congregations located a little closer to another convention city, but it is preferred that you attend at the location indicated so as to prevent unnecessary crowding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Where the chart indicates that a portion of a circuit, such as % or V<sub>4</sub>, is assigned to a particular location, it simply means that those congregations in the part of the circuit closest to that convention should attend where indicated and the rest of the circuit should attend the convention closest to them, as shown elsewhere on the list.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING ARRANGEMENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> You should make your own rooming arrangements directly with the hotel or motel by using the information that will be provided by the convention through your congregation. In most cases you will pay less than the regular rates charged by the hotel or motel, since the convention has negotiated for a large number of good quality rooms to be set aside for this purpose. These rooms will be assigned by the hotel or motel only to those identifying themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses or as delegates attending the Watchtower Convention. By the middle of December 1983, your congregation will have received a list of hotels and motels in the convention city that are cooperating closely with the Society’s rooming arrangement. It will show the address of the facility, its agreed-upon rates and the phone number to be used in making your reservations. PLEASE NOTE: The program will start at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: </span><span class="font13">As SOOn as your congregation receives the list of hotels and motels from the convention organization you should IMMEDIATELY phone the hotel or motel of your choice, identifying yourself as one of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">' OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, JANUARY 1984</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower Convention. Doing so will qualify you for the agreed-upon rates listed. One night’s </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">deposit </span><span class="font13">will be required at all locations to hold the room and should be sent directly to the hotel or motel </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">as soon as</span><span class="font13"> you make your reservations. Do not make rooming arrangements you do not intend to keep. (Matt. 5:37) </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Motels or hotels are not obligated to hold the rooms or extend the special rates beyond the cutoff date without a deposit.</span><span class="font13"> If you find it necessary for good reason to cancel your accommodations, you should write or phone the hotel or motel directly, doing so as far in advance' as possible. This makes the room available to other delegates who need accommodations. The convention Rooming Department will monitor the arrangement and provide additional information through the congregation, such as which hotels or motels are filled after a month or two, as well as any additional ones it may find necessary to add to the list. If the hotel or motel you call first is filled, then call your next selection from the list, and so on.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> DORMITORIES: </span><span class="font13">A few conventions use school dormitories in order to accommodate all those attending. Usually congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first hotel or motel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow through in accord with the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> SPECIAL NEEDS: </span><span class="font13">Arrangements to care for those with special needs should be made by the congregation where these attend. Elders and others aware of such circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often involves taking others with them in their own group, for example, those in full-time service, the elderly, the infirm, the deaf or others who have the need. Also, they may care for such ones in other ways. (Acts 20:35; Jas. 2: 15-17; 1 John 3:17, 18) We are confident that loving concern will be shown to all who need our help. (2 Cor. 6:11-13; John 13:35; Gal. .6:10) However, the convention Rooming Department will endeavor to provide rooming accommodations for those with special needs who cannot be cared for by themselves or by those in the congregation where they attend. These may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for a Special Needs Room Request Form, discussing their situation with him at that time. Those with special needs are the only ones that should use this form. They should fill it out and return it to the convention coordinator to be checked for completeness, accuracy and verification of circumstances. Even though the convention coordinator forwards it to the convention Rooming Department, the individual will be notified directly of the accommodations by the Rooming Department. This should be done well ahead of the convention. The publisher with special needs should NOT simply go to the convention and request a room when he arrives, because the convention Rooming Department needs the verification of the congregation’s convention coordinator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Private home accommodations listed by the convention are usually set aside for those with limited funds who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money. Nor is it proper to presume upon the hospitality of our brothers by expecting them to accommodate delegates extra days so they can visit vacation spots or do other things before or after the convention. These rooms are for the convention period </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">only.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> DELEGATES ATTENDING FROM OUTSIDE THE ASSIGNED AREA: </span><span class="font13">District conventions are arranged at many locations to reduce travel. In nearly every case, the location assigned for you to attend is the one nearest your congregation. Seating, literature, food orders, and so forth, are planned on the premise that the majority will attend the convention to which they are assigned. However, if a few for important reasons must attend a location other than the one assigned, they may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for the address of the convention headquarters where they wish to attend. He will find these addresses listed on the back of the Special Needs Room Request Form. Unless these persons have special needs, they should </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font13"> use the Special Needs Room Request Form. Rather, they should write to the convention headquarters where they wish to attend and request a copy of the hotel or motel listing for that location, sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope along with this request. Upon receipt of this listing of hotels and motels, they should proceed just as if they were using the list for their local area.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> YOUR COOPERATION APPRECIATED: </span><span class="font13">The smoothness with which this rooming (arrangement functions depends largely on the cooperation of everyone involved. For instance, if a number of delegates run ahead and make reservations on their own before the congregation receives the list of facilities that are cooperating with the convention Rooming Department, it could cause a major breakdown in negotiations. Also, it could result in difficulties if a large number of delegates choose, for one reason or another, to make their own arrangements with facilities not listed jthat have not cooperated with the convention rooming arrangement. The listing is broad enough to give a choice of good quality accommodations and yet give preference to the hotels or motels that cooperate. Our aim with this rooming arrangement is to help delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible, so they will be refreshed and fully able to enjoy the fine spiritual program.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> As shown in the accompanying chart, sign language translation will be provided </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font13"> at 16 specific convention cities. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(No</span><span class="font13"> provisions will be made at any other conventions for sign language.) We know this will prove to be a real blessing to those with this special need by providing good quality translating and larger groups with which to enjoy upbuilding fellowship. Those who are signers can do much to let the deaf in their congregation know of these arrangements and help them to attend where the sign language provision is made by the Society.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Improving Our Teaching Ability —By Effective Use of Illustrations</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In our teaching work, how can we help people to grasp mentally the spiritual truths from God’s Word? How can individuals be helped to benefit from pointed counsel being studied? How can we help people to meditate deeply on spiritual things and be motivated in their minds and hearts? One way is this: Effective use of verbal illustrations—using familiar examples to make matters more easily understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IMITATE JESUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jesus was the master Teacher. A close examination of his teaching methods reveals that often he used illustrations to rebuke opposers (Mark 12:12, -17), to counsel his disciples (Matt. 18:1-6; Luke 22: 24-27; John 13:3-17) and to determine the attitude of those listening to him. (Matt. 13:10-15; John 6: 48-69) However, it seems apparent that the chief aim of Jesus' illustrations was to teach concerning the Kingdom. (Matt. 13:31-35) Some of Jesus’ illustrations were very short, just a sentence or two. Others were longer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> For example, when Peter asked Jesus how many times a brother should be forgiven, did Jesus answer immediately by counseling Peter that he should not keep account of the injury but be loving, merciful and forgiving? No. Rather, Jesus related a simple illustration about a slave who owed a large sum of money to a king. (Matt. 18:21-35) The lesson was made to stand out clearly by contrasting two courses of action. And the conclusion made a direct personal application. What was the effect of this illustration? Even today our hearts are touched when we read and understand its powerful message urging us to be forgiving.—See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">United, in Worship, </span><span class="font12">page 134, paragraph 9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> But how does one acquire skill and experience in using illustrations? First, review the material in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook</span><span class="font12"> on “Fitting Illustrations,” pages 168-71. In paragraph 8 on page 169 the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Guidebook</span><span class="font12"> says: “An illustration should be easily visualized, with not too many elements presented at one time. It should be pointed and concrete.” When assignments are prepared for the Theocratic Ministry School, thoughtful consideration can be given to developing illustrations that are appropriate to the material and to the audience.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The ability to use good illustrations comes from being alert to circumstances around us daily. For example, on a very hot day, how refreshing is a tall, cool glass of water! But of what spiritual aspects can this refreshment remind us? Jehovah’s mercy? the waters of truth that we bring to others? the precious association of our brothers? and so forth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Much can be learned from observing how the Society’s publications use illustrations, and on occasion we may repeat some of these with good effect. For example, on pages 32 and 33 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book there is a simple illustration about a man on the wrong road who is examining a map. His need for humbly accepting proper direction is compared to the need of sincere people to accept Jehovah’s direction and align their lives with his Word. On page 36 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book the impossibility of a meat chopper being assembled by having its parts shaken in a washtub well illustrates how the existence of an orderly universe required an intelligent Creator. Remember, simple illustrations are best. Jesus used little things to explain big things', things easy to understand to explain deep spiritual truths.—Matt. 13:44; 23:24; 24:32, 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> A word of caution: If an illustration is complicated, in bad taste or just does not fit the situation, it should not be used. But if we work at it, we can develop the art of using effective illustrations. They can help us to teach the deep truths of God’s Word and motivate honest-hearted ones to serve Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS ]</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>With a Positive Approach</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> A positive mental attitude contributes greatly to a happy and productive ministry. When we preach the good news, whether from house to house, on the streets or elsewhere, we should do so expecting to meet with success. We should approach each person, assuming that he is sheeplike at heart or will at least listen to the Kingdom message. When Jesus sent out his disciples, he offered this counsel: “Wherever you enter into a house say first, ‘May this house have peace.’” (Luke 10: 5, 6) They were not to prejudge as to whether “a friend of peace&quot; was in the house or not. A positive approach! How may we display such a positive attitude in our field ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SPEAK WITH CONVICTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> One way is to speak the truth with conviction. We are preaching, not just another religion, but the truth that leads to life! We know what the future holds. We know the reasons for man’s present dilemma and what honest-hearted ones must do to learn the solution. This conviction will help us speak like the apostles, whose boldness even their enemies had to acknowledge. Note Acts 4:13, which says: “When they beheld the outspokenness of Peter and John, . . . they began to recognize about them that they used to be with Jesus.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Some publishers may feel they are not qualified to preach the good news. They may think they never will become effective and experienced publishers. They may regard making return visits or conducting Bible studies as something beyond their abilities. However, such negative thinking is counterproductive. Notice how Jehovah corrected Jeremiah’s thinking and encouraged him. (Jer. 1:7) So take a positive approach towards the preaching work, imitate the prophets and the apostles, and you, too, can become more effective in proclaiming the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Yearbook &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">19-percent increase, or more than 33,000 additional pioneers, over last year. Great potential for continued increases is seen in the total of 1,797,112 home Bible studies reported, a 13-percent increase over 1982. No doubt many of those now studying are well on their way to becoming new praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> There were 514,920 more persons attending the Memorial celebration in 1983, making a total of 6,767,707—an 8-percent increase over 1982. What fine potential for further increase is seen in these figures!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Our manner of expressing ourselves has much to do with reaching the hearts of those who listen. Negative expressions prompt negative replies and so they do not reach a person’s heart or motivate him. Better results will likely be achieved with more positive statements such as: “I am sure you see the value of learning more about the Bible.” Or: &quot;I would like to leave this publication with you. It is an excellent Bible study aid and will certainly be of value to you and your family.&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">STRESS POSITIVE INFORMATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> In witnessing, we often comment on the world’s problems. But it is usually best to switch quickly to God’s solution and to a description of the blessings that will replace the troubles we see today. For example, the title of the book being offered this month is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</span><span class="font12"> A positive title! The scriptures for the Topic for Conversation also present a positive view, namely: “Everlasting life is possible” and “We can believe the Bible.&quot; With such statements our presentation of the good news will take on an optimistic tone. If time permits, we could read paragraph 14 on page 14 as we offer the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font12">book this month. It will add to our positive approach. Similarly, when we offer the magazines, we should look for positive statements that will help the person at the door to see that our message is truly </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font12"> news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Presenting the good news with a positive approach will also result in personal benefits. It will increase our joy in the field ministry. We will view each person as a potential Bible student, someone who needs the truth. We will not be discouraged when people are unresponsive or when they speak in an unkindly manner. What a blessing it is to have an accurate knowledge of the truth that can set one free. We certainly want to present it in a positive way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Does not this encouraging report on last year’s activity move you to want to continue doing all that you can in Kingdom service during the current 1984 service year? How very appropriate our 1984 yeartext as taken from Philip-pians 1:14: “Speak the word of God fearlessly”! Many of us may, indeed, be faced with trialsome situations in carrying out our ministry during 1984, but that was also the situation with many of our brothers scattered throughout the world during 1983. Still, Jehovah did not allow trialsome seasons to slow down his work, and this is clearly</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Christian Trust &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">siastically recommend it to others during January. Listening closely to demonstrations and experiences presented at the Service Meeting will help prepare us for the field ministry. Discussing with others the contents of the book and how to present it in the field will likewise aid in making our ministry more effective.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Have you had the joy of conducting a home Bible study in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book? If so, have you noticed how quickly the interested ones learn and how they readily act on what they learn? One sister writes: “Having just returned home from our ‘Kingdom Unity’ District Convention, my heart is filled to overflowing. I just had to write and share my joy with you. I had the privilege of seeing three of my Bible students symbolize their dedication by water baptism.” Then she commented that the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font12">book had hastened their progress toward dedication and baptism. Others have made similar comments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONTINUE TO GUARD OUR TRUST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Accepting the Christian trust is one thing. Continuing to guard it is quite another. Undoubtedly that is why Paul also wrote Timothy: “Continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe, knowing from what persons you learned them.” (2 Tim. 3:14) At 2 Peter 1:5-8 we find similar exhortation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> We certainly want to ‘continue in the things we learned.’ We have no desire to become “inactive or unfruitful.” We want to guard jealously “the pattern of healthful words” and the ministry of the truth that has been committed to our care. Our goal is to render a satisfactory account for this “fine trust” that Jehovah has so generously placed in our possession. Let us look to him for the wisdom and spiritual strength that will make this possible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">evident from the compiled report.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Speaking further about Jehovah’s blessing upon his modern-day spiritual nation, Isaiah said: “You have added to the nation; O Jehovah, you have added to the nation; you have glorified yourself. You have extended afar all the borders of the land.” (Isa. 26:15) To what extent Jehovah will continue to increase the blessings upon his people this side of the great tribulation, we do not know. But certainly it is the desire of each one of us to be able to receive news of the “final report” and rejoice for having had a share in the work assigned.</span></p></li></ul>

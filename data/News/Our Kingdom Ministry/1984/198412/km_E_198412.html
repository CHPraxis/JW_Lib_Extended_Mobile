<p><span class="font1">The Bible—A Book of Hope. Rom. 15:4—Things written aforetime to give us hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Titus 1:2—Gives solid basis for hope of everlasting life.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">What Does the Bible Mean to You?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Among the millions of books written, one stands out as unique, different from all the rest. It is the Bible. It provides the oldest historical record, going back to the origin of the universe. It can be found in all parts of the earth and in more than 1,700 languages and dialects. It is the best known, most widely circulated, most quoted of all books.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> How are its contents viewed around the world? Although largely unaware of what it contains, millions of professed Christians call it the Word of God. There are vocal critics who label much of it as myth. Others laud it as a remarkable historical record but reject its counsel as impractical for the nuclear age. To great masses of people not professing Christianity, the Bible is, at best, nothing more than the sayings of perceptive men who possessed above-average intelligence. In each case, the attitude of people toward the Bible has reflected their estimation of its value.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT IT MEANS TO US</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> How do we view the Bible? We have “accepted it, not as the word of men, but, just as it truthfully is, as the word of God.” (1 Thess. 2:13) We know its contents represent divine</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Are Kingdom Interests First in Your Life?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jesus was willing to give his life on behalf of God’s Kingdom. When on trial for his life before Pilate he remained steadfast. (John 18:37) Even as he hung dying on the stake he highlighted God’s Kingdom as mankind’s hope, saying to the evildoer: “You will be with me in Paradise.”—Luke 23:43.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> We 'can understand why Jesus viewed the Kingdom as being so important. He had been sent from heaven to “bear witness to the truth” that God’s Kingdom would rule in righteousness and make it possible for His will to be done on earth as in heaven. What could bring greater joy than carrying out Jehovah’s will to transform the earth into the Paradise that was originally intended? And what a wonderful prospect Jesus held out —that of seeing all faithful and obedient mankind united in pure worship around the globe!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COUNTING THE COST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Following Jesus’ example in keeping Kingdom interests first is rarely easy. Priorities have to be established in the life of each follower of Christ. Jesus explained that he “came to start a fire on the wisdom that is “able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (Heb. 4:12) Applying its counsel will ‘equip us for every good work.’ (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) Its value cannot be measured in material riches. (Prov. 3:13-15) To us, it is a guide in all affairs of life. Truly, we ‘love it.’—Ps. 119:97,105.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HANDLING IT ARIGHT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Accepting it as the Word of God obligates us to handle it aright. (2 Tim. 2:15) This means that while making a wholehearted effort to live in harmony with its counsel, we should also do our best to help others appreciate God’s Word and use it as their guide. We feel obliged to use every means we have to make the Bible readily available and better understood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> How grateful we are for the revised and updated 1984 edition of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font11"> It contains thousands of marginal references that confirm the interlocking harmony of all 66 Bible books. It will surely prove to be an invaluable aid to student and teacher alike. During December, after first placing all the 1971 and 1981 edition Bibles on hand, we will start distribution in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1} </span><span class="font11">earth” and that there would be divisions in families over the Kingdom issue.—Luke 12:49-53.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Imitating Jesus as an advocate of God’s Kingdom means carrying a “torture stake” and all that this involves. ‘Counting the cost’ means that a person must be prepared to say “good-bye” to his material belongings if they stand in the way of his service to God. (Luke 14:27, 28, 33) At the same time, Jesus encouraged all to be his followers and to share the good news with others. The attaining of everlasting life under Kingdom rule is worth any cost. —Matt. 13:44-46.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">STOP BEING ANXIOUS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> It is good to ask ourselves whether Kingdom interests are first in our life. Jesus explained: “No one can slave for two masters . . . You cannot slave for God and for Riches. .. . Stop being anxious about your souls as to what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies as to what you will wear.” (Matt. 6:24, 25) Do we have sufficient faith in Jesus’ counsel to seek first the Kingdom, trusting that all </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page If, col.</span><span class="font11"> 1)</span></p></li></ul>

(Example: Referring to Matthew 6:10, point out marginal references on the words “kingdom,&quot; “will” and “earth.” Show how these provide sufficient information for a well-rounded discussion on the Kingdom.)

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Continued support of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund by the brothers has made it possible to start 22 Kingdom Hall projects in 15 states. Loans have been made available for large and small projects.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Efforts are made to ensure that attractive and functional facilities are designed and built to serve the needs of the congregations now and for the future. During the design, construction and furnishing of the new Kingdom Halls, the brothers have endeavored to keep costs as low as possible. Keeping costs down has enabled more congregations to receive loans from the Society Kingdom Hall Fund.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Evidence of Jehovah’s blessing upon his organization is manifest in many ways, including the present numerical increase. This means there is an ever greater need for more Kingdom Halls. The arrangement for the Society Kingdom Hall Fund allows each one in the organization to have a personal share in filling that need. Money contributed to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund is loaned out to assist the congregations. As congregations send in their loan payments, such funds, along with the regular Society Kingdom Hall Fund contributions received each month, make it possible for more loans to be made available for other Kingdom Hall projects. Our accelerated efforts to meet the need for more Kingdom Halls are based on such support from the brothers. The donations received are very much appreciated.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> School overseers will also want to pay special attention to the following points: First, they should make sure to cover the points appearing in the written reviews if this is not done by the program participants. Second, they should give constructive and practical counsel to the students before bringing out interesting points not mentioned in the student talk. Third, school overseers will be conscious of timing, not running overtime themselves, and privately counseling those giving the instruction talk who neglect to watch their timing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In working out meeting schedules, it would be well for the presiding overseer and the school overseer to collaborate so that, where possible, one elder is not given an assignment for both meetings on the same evening. Also, where there is need, qualified ministerial servants may be used for instruction talks and Bible highlights.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The total number of regular pioneers reporting for September is outstanding. From our previous peak of 29,764 last August, the regular pioneer ranks swelled, in one month, to 34,232 in September. What a remarkable manifestation of increase in this branch of our sacred service! The faith of these thousands who have been working toward the theocratic goal of regular pioneer service is commendable. May our efforts result in more people praising Jehovah.—Ps. 113:1. \</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In a Way That Brings Personal Joy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people have good reason to be joyful. We have a real hope for the future. As Isaiah 65: 17,18 assures, Jehovah is “creating new heavens and a new earth” and then adds: “Exult, you people, and be joyful forever in what I am creating. For here I am creating Jerusalem a cause for joyfulness and her people a cause for exultation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">- We should find our greatest joy in sharing our marvelous hope with others. Do you find that your joy in the ministry is limited? If so, remember that joy is a fruit of the spirit. It can be cultivated and increased through personal effort. Hard work can bring cause for joy and, in turn, great joy can cause us to work even harder. (Eccl. 2:10) Earnest effort can be rewarded with greater evidences of the spirit’s fruitage.—2 Pet. 1:5-8; 1 Cor. 14:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The enthusiasm radiated by our brothers in their service confirms that what they are doing is bringing them great joy. How can we increase our share in that joy? One way is by learning how to find satisfaction in doing our assigned work despite the negative reaction of many of those to whom we preach. Jeremiah encountered much opposition, and the same was true of Jesus; they did not stop. Satan would like to discourage us by using the apathy, indifference or opposition of others. But, as Jesus explained, by continuing on faithfully despite opposition, we will find joy and happiness.—Matt. 5: 11, 12; Heb. 12:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Understanding that the end of this system is near and the time</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">these other things will be added? Or, are we ‘anxious about our souls'?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Do you frequently miss meetings or service activities of the congregation because of secular work, taking it for granted that you must comply with the demands of your employer? Some brothers have turned down higher paying jobs because the work schedule would interfere with theocratic activities. Many have found that employers will make concessions to accommodate employees who are dependable, willing workers. (Col. 3:23, 24) The congregation is strengthened in a left to accomplish our work is short, we will be motivated to do what we can to share the truth with others. (Rev. 12:12, 17) If we truly have love for God and neighbor, we will find joy in our ministry because we know it pleases Jehovah and helps others find the way to life. .</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A GIFT FROM GOD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> You might consider your service as though you were bringing a gift to your neighbors. This gift is the prospect of everlasting life. But for those who do not yet appreciate the value of the gift, perhaps you can make it more appealing by the manner in which you present it. Do you prepare your presentation well so that it will stimulate interest? If you speak in a pleasant and courteous manner, using well-chosen words that arouse interest, you may get a good response that will give you more joy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Field service is a treasure Jehovah has given us. It permits us to demonstrate our faith. We should work to improve our ability to speak convincingly to others about our hope. If we always try to leave householders in a good frame of mind, it may make them more receptive when the next Witness calls, thus contributing to his joy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Remember, too, that each householder has his own interests in life. If we express personal interest in him and in his family and show how the Bible will be helpful to him, we will often find a warm response and an open door for a return visit. The joy we find in such experiences can be shared with others for their encouragement. (Acts 15:3) And most important of all, think of the joy we bring to the One who sent us!—Luke 15:7, 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">fine way when elders, ministerial servants and pioneers set a good example in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAN NOW</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Some of you young people will soon be out of school. Are you making plans now for a theocratic future? Some may intend to work for a short period and then take up pioneering. Why put off the opportunity to have a full share in Kingdom service in favor of accumulating material assets? Why not pursue first things first? If the Kingdom is first in your life, then why not pioneer first? When a secular job gets priority, there is a</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> This world has a way of requiring much from those who are willing to slave for it. Succumbing to the enticement of material advantages results in large debts, which require an ever-increasing income. How much better to trust in Jehovah who knows our needs and has promised to supply them. By keeping Kingdom interests first, our lives will have real purpose, strengthened by the prospect of endless future blessings.—Matt. 6:32; 1 Tim. 6:18, 19.</span></p>

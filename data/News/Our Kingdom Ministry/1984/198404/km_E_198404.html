<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Giving Our All in Jehovah’s Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> One of the highlights of the past service year was the 19-percent increase in the average number of pioneers worldwide. This notable increase resulted in grand measure from the many more who served as auxiliary pioneers during the year. For example, last April in the United States alone we had 84,285 auxiliary pioneers. This was 13 percent of the total publishers reporting that month. It is hoped that even more will have arranged to serve as auxiliary pioneers this April.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Those who are able to auxiliary pioneer find much joy in doing so. (Neh. 8:10; Acts 20:35) They are in a position to have a larger share in spreading the truth from God’s Word, and what greater privilege could anyone have? What more worthwhile work could anyone engage in? Congregations that have a goodly number of auxiliary pioneers are built up because such individuals share their fine experiences with others and invite them to participate with them in the field ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CAN WE DO MORE?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Most of us, however, are not able to auxiliary pioneer all the time. But are we regularly giving our all in Jehovah’s service? Could we do</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Benefiting Fully From the Memorial</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22:19) With those words our Lord Jesus Christ, on the night of instituting the Lord’s Evening Meal, set forth a command for his followers. That command is still observed faithfully on the anniversary date of Nisan 14 to our very day over 1,900 years later. In this year of 1984 the date for the Memorial celebration is Sunday, April 15, after sundown. At that time, in upwards of 46,200 congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses around the earth, God’s people will come together in obedience to Jesus’ command.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Celebrating the Memorial has great meaning to Jehovah’s Witnesses. In some instances those who are the anointed brothers of Christ with prospects of reigning with him in the heavenly Kingdom will be among the attenders. Other gatherings may be made up entirely of those whose hope it is to be part of the “great crowd” foretold in Revelation 7:9. These have earthly hopes of life under God’s Kingdom. But in either case, because it is such a special occasion, Jehovah’s Witnesses make great effort to encourage others to more? In Trinidad last April, 52 percent of the total number of publishers served as auxiliary pioneers. It took much advance planning and a whole-souled desire to support the special month of activity. But think of the marvelous effect it had on the work there to have had more than half of the publishers in the auxiliary pioneer service during that one month. Could more of us in this country share in auxiliary pioneer work?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Perhaps some of us could be auxiliary pioneers on a more regular basis. Or, to give our all in Jehovah’s-service, could more of us be in the regular pioneer work? Then there are those who may be in a position to serve where the need is greater. There are places in this country where the territory is not covered regularly. Are any of us in a position to move to such an area? Or, might some of us be able on a temporary basis to help work unassigned territories? Some Witness families, wanting to assist in this way, have used their vacations to work unassigned territory. They have even arranged for others to accompany them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> If we cannot increase the time </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">be in attendance at the observance, inviting all persons showing interest in Bible truth. So w’hat can we do to ensure that the greatest number of persons desirous of properly observing the Memorial of Christ’s death are in attendance? Here are a number of things to have in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THINGS TO DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Now is the time to be distributing Memorial invitations to our Bible students and to those who have manifested interest in the truth because of our preaching and teaching activity. It may be necessary to help some make arrangements to attend. Be sure you let them know the time and place for the Memorial celebration, since this information is not indicated on the invitation. You may want to use your regular congregation handbill in conjunction with the Memorial invitation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> It would be good to explain to new ones what takes place at the Memorial celebration. Some of those you invite may know very little about why the Memorial was instituted, who partake of the emblems and why unleavened bread and red wine </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page if, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">we spend in the field ministry or move to a location where more help is needed, there may still be another way we can do more when it comes to giving our all in Jehovah’s service. That is to improve the quality of our service by making the most of the time we do spend in the ministry. Are we going in service at a time when we can expect to accomplish the most good, finding the greatest number of people at home? Also, when in the service, do we try to adapt our presentation to fit the householder? We should take into consideration what the householder may have to say, as well as his or her own facial expressions. Is the person young or old, male or female? We should try to tailor our presentation to fit the individual and the circumstances.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Make Your Street Witnessing Productive</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Street witnessing is not new. Jeremiah was instructed to proclaim his message “in the streets of Jerusalem.” (Jer. 11:6) Jesus Christ taught in the “broad ways” of the cities and villages he visited. (Luke 13: 22, 26) Though house-to-house visitation is the primary method used by Jehovah’s modern-day witnesses to contact people, street witnessing continues to be an effective way to publicize the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Whether you engage in street witnessing only occasionally or spend a considerable amount of time in this feature of the ministry, you will want to make each hour of street witnessing as productive as possible. How? What can be done? First, keep in mind that your objective is to make personal contact with people in order to share the good news. With that goal in mind, select locations where many people pass regularly. Some find that shopping areas, places near bus or subway stops, or frequently used parks are good locations. Also, during the morning and evening hours when people are going to or coming from work, street witnessing can be very effective. People can be contacted as they enter or leave areas where it is difficult for us to gain entrance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO DO IT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> If you are physically able to move about freely, it is generally more effective to approach passersby, rather than wait for them to approach you. In doing so, be selective, discerning and considerate. Wisely avoid persons who look as if they may cause problems. Above all, be friendly, warm, complimentary and dignified in your approach. Try to establish eye contact. Endeavor to use pointed, thought-provoking questions to arouse interest in the magazines. When interest is shown, in a discreet way ask for the person’s name and address so a return visit can be made. In some territories it may be best to work with others; still, to get the most done, work separately but close enough to be of assistance to one another.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Regularly witnessing in one location at scheduled times can improve your effectiveness in street witnessing. Some who do this have found that the people come to know them and become friends with them. In one congregation an elderly sister did this. On occasions when she was not at her regular place due to sickness, people actually wrote the congregation, asking why she was not there.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Do you find many not-at-homes in your territory? One couple did</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Oompiroving Our T®a©fol!K® Ability —Reaching the Student’s HosiirQ</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jesus taught in such a way as to reach the heart of those he instructed. In explaining the parable of the sower, he showed that only those who ‘get the sense of the word’ will be moved to act. (Read Matthew 13:18, 23, 51, 52.) So, as we teach we must be mindful of reaching the student’s heart. We want to build appreciation for Jehovah, his Son and the Christian organization. We need to imitate Jesus in our teaching. This involves taking the time needed when conducting Bible studies to help students to reflect on the points being considered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> The apostle Peter’s teaching reached the hearts of the 3,000 who were then baptized on the day of Pentecost, 33 C.E. He helped them to reason on Scriptural prophecy related to Jesus’ death and resurrection, so that they could appreciate the roles played by Jehovah and Jesus Christ in what had taken place. (Acts 2:1-36) The Bible reports that those who believed were “stabbed to the heart” and “embraced his word heartily.” (Acts 2:37, 41) How can we today teach so as to reach people’s hearts and help them build similar love for the truth?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TAKE TIME TO REACH HEARTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Those with whom we conduct Bible studies must get more than just facts about the Bible and world events. They need to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">feel</span><span class="font14"> something about what they are learning. We must get them to reason on what they learn. (Acts 17:2, 3) They must be helped to understand what Jehovah and Jesus are like, and what they have done for us. They need to see how Jehovah has shown love, patience and mercy in all his dealings with man. They must understand and respect his power and agree with his righteous requirements. They need to see the value of the great sacrifice Jesus made and realize the wis-and decided to do street work nearby. In one hour each of them placed 17 magazines. Several persons they contacted said they lived in the territory the publishers had just worked that morning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> There is no doubt that street witnessing can and does produce fine results. Our very presence in public places speaks well of the message we carry. One Canadian newspaper commented: “It must take courage to stand and offer these magazines to passersby. Those Jehovah’s Witnesses doing so do not appear to be ashamed or self-conscious and are obviously proud of the publication.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> You, too, can do street witnessing dom of the course he took. In this way they can be drawn into a warm personal relationship with Jehovah and Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship</span><span class="font14"> books are designed to help us reach the hearts of our students and build heart appreciation. Observe how paragraphs 9 and 10 on page 10 of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font14"> book help the student to reason on the fact that a loving God would not create humans with a desire to live forever and then fail to make it possible for them to fulfill that desire. Throughout chapter 4 of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font14">book there are examples of building heart appreciation. Especially note the examples in paragraphs 5, 12 and 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Throughout the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship</span><span class="font14"> we find questions directed at the heart of the student. Excellent examples of this are on pages 32 and 33. These questions cause the student to think and examine his hfeart motive carefully. They help him reflect on his feelings toward Jehovah, Jesus and the organization. Gradually he becomes more aware of what course he should be taking to please Jehovah and gain his blessings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARE WELL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> So, as we conduct our Bible studies let us prepare well and then take sufficient time to reason with our students on the material presented. This way we will build into their hearts a warm feeling for Jehovah, Jesus and the organization. If we succeed in reaching our students’ hearts, they will be moved to take a course of action similar to that of the 3,000 who were baptized on the day of Pentecost, 33 C.E. (Acts 2: 41-46) They will be helped to withstand Satan’s influence and efforts to mislead them.—Matt. 7:24-27.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">and you can be productive. Jehovah God will most certainly bless your sincere efforts in using this avenue of service to communicate Kingdom truth to persons in your territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Today insecurity and distress threaten the lives of people worldwide. War, famine, disease and disaster are on the increase. Governments are unstable, fearful and tottering. The best efforts of men do not alleviate the situation. Peace no longer exists. (Rev. 6:4) People want to know why there is so much distress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> How thankful we are that Jehovah has given us peace of mind in these stressful times. (Phil. 4:7) How pleased we are to understand why there is such turmoil in the world today. Our peace has come as a result of learning about Jehovah’s purposes and subjecting ourselves to his organizational arrangements. This precious possession of peace stimulates in us the desire to extend it to others by helping them understand how world events are fulfilling Bible prophecy.—Rom. 10:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> An effective means of bringing this message to others is </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font14"> It offers to all people the good news that God’s Kingdom will soon destroy those who oppress their fellowman. The Kingdom will turn the earth into a peaceful Paradise. The April and May issues of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> are especially directed to the events surrounding the marked year 1914. This fits in with our Topic for Conversation “Hope Despite World Distress Since 1914.” No doubt you will enjoy using this topic and offering these timely issues that will help individuals gain insight as to why the world is filled with disturbing conditions. Do you have a presentation in mind?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFERING SUBSCRIPTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> One way of introducing the Topic for Conversation if? this: “We are glad we found you home today. We are discussing a matter that is on the minds of many people due to the lack of peace in the world. Many wonder, ‘Why is it that the nations cannot work out their problems by cooperation?’” (Allow for comment.) Then go on to say: “At Matthew 24:7 Jesus for etold, distressing conditions that would take peace away from the earth. [Read.] News reports indicate these things are happening today. Many sincere people are wondering if conditions will get better. What do you think? [Allow for comment.] Matthew 24:13 says that some will be saved through this time of distress. [Read.] The April 15 issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> develops the theme ‘1914—A Focal Point of Bible Prophecy.’ [Possibly tie in specific point from article.] We are offering this magazine on a yearly subscription basis. You can receive 24 issues for $3.50.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> If the householder is very busy, you might simply say, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> helps me keep watch on world events as they fulfill Bible prophecy. It brings the comforting message that soon God’s Kingdom will turn this earth into a wonderful Paradise. You can receive two issues of the magazine each month for a year for only $3.50.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> If the householder does not have the money for the subscription, then would it be possible for you to make arrangements to call back at another time? Or would it be practical to offer the subscription for six months for only $2.00? Those who do not wish to subscribe to the magazines should be encouraged to accept the current issues of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font14">and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> for 30 cents.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BE POSITIVE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Some have a personal goal that they strive to meet during the subscription campaigns. Work toward your goal with confidence and zeal. Keep a positive attitude. Remember all that Jehovah has done for us through his Son Jesus Christ and the provision of spiritual food by means of “the faithful and discreet slave.” As we do so and pray for Jehovah’s blessing on our efforts, we will have fine results with the subscription offer. Our joy will cause others to see the unique value of the magazines. (John 15:11) Do not hesitate to offer the subscriptions at every appropriate opportunity in field service!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Some in the congregation may have a part in seeing to it that the Kingdom Hall, or some other location to be used, is neat and clean, with well-arranged seating. The elders will want to be sure that the unleavened bread, red wine and necessary utensils are provided, that the sound equipment is in good working order, and that attendants and servers are assigned and instructed for the occasion. A capable elder should be assigned to deliver the Memorial talk. The Society provides an appropriate outline for this. The talk should provide rich spiritual nourishment for all, whether they are of the anointed or the other sheep, or are newly interested ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Elders will also want to be sure the time schedule is adhered to, particularly where more than one congregation will be using the same hall.

We need to know where the tour is originating, how many are in the group, the language in which the tour should be conducted, the name of the group captain and the expected time of arrival. By having this information ahead of time, better planning can be given to arrangements for a sufficient number of tour guides to assist those wishing to see the Society’s facilities. Your cooperation in this regard will help assure that all visitors will enjoy a good tour.</span></p></li></ul>

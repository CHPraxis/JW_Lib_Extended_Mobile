<p><span class="font0">Increase Praise to Jehovah During February</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah deserves to be, praised! He is worthy of honor because he created all things, including us. (Rev. 4:11) We owe our lives to him. For this we are grateful and feel motivated to praise Jehovah in any way we can.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> How can you personally increase your praise to Jehovah during February? One fine way is by having a good share in distributing the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book. This may require careful planning and perhaps some adjustments in your regular daily schedule. Also remember to invite others to work with you in field service. Especially try to help publishers who may be having difficulty in getting out regularly in the house-to-house ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book has proved to be especially effective in moving others to praise Jehovah. It not only presents basic truths in a clear manner but also builds appreciation for the fine qualities of our God. Continue to offer this outstanding Bible study aid during February.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">STARTING BIBLE STUDIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Another way that we can honor Jehovah is by diligently following</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Expanding Your Ministry as a Regular Pioneer</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “It has taken long, careful, prayerful consideration before sending this.” Those were the words of one sister in a letter that accompanied her regular pioneer application the first of this service year. She was now able to join her daughter who entered the pioneer work upon graduation from high school last summer. Prayerful consideration—yes, that is a prerequisite for those who would expand their ministry into regular pioneer service. Have you prayerfully reflected on your circumstances and considered how you might take up this blessed privilege?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> We are assured by the apostle John that we will receive what we pray for in harmony with God’s will. (1 John 5:14, 15) And what special work has Jehovah willed to be done in these last days? “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness,” answers Jesus. (Matt. 24:14) Jesus also indicated that we should “beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” (Matt. 9:37, 38) Jehovah will surely pay attention to our heartfelt request for more workers, perhaps enabling us to enter the regular pioneer service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">up interest we find in the field. Placing literature is just the start. The real goal is to make disciples who'can share with us in praising our God. (Compare Acts 2:42, 46; 47.) Strive to start studies. The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book makes conducting studies easier, enabling even newer publishers to have a share in this important work. One publisher, who conducted no studies before the book was released, reported later: “I have three studies and a fourth one ready to start. . . . I cannot say ‘Thank you’ enough for making Bible studies easy to conduct.” Have you sincerely tried to start a study in this book? Have you prayed about the matter? If you feel you need help, have you asked your Congregation Book Study conductor or another experienced publisher to assist you? Others are willing to help you and in this way also increase praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book has been instrumental in increasing the number of Bible studies being conducted. During the 1982 service </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Great diversity in age, background and circumstances is evident among those wholeheartedly responding to the need for more full-time preachers. A 96-year-old brother who started pioneering just over a year ago continues to do excellent work as a pioneer. One housewife and mother of several children views her pioneering as a family project that is proving to be a source of spiritual enrichment for all in her household.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CAN CIRCUMSTANCES BE CHANGED?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> “Yes,” answers a mother of three who moved into a smaller apartment after her last child married. Having pioneered before, she kept the pioneer spirit alive and, when circumstances permitted, adjusted her situation to resume her pioneer service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> It is wise to count the cost when considering the regular pioneer work. (Luke 14:28) It is not a matter of ‘pioneering at all costs.’ However, some who at first thought they could not pioneer have analyzed the way they were using their time. By adjusting their schedule, they made room for the three hours that were needed on the average </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page</span><span class="font13"> 4, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">year, we averaged 344,493 Bible studies each month. However, during the 1983 service year when we started using the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font13">book in field service, we averaged 390,678, an increase of 13 percent, more than 46,000 additional studies each month! In April of 1983 we had an all-time peak of 436,500 studies. These studies are being conducted with people whose lives can be saved. The end result will be a further increase in praisers of our deserving God.</span></p>

Look what happened when Andrew enthusiastically reported the good news to his fleshly brother, Simon Peter. (John 1:40-42) Or, have you talked with your neighbors, co-workers or schoolmates, offering them a Bible study? Since you are close acquaintances, there is already a foundation on which you can build. Prayerfully consider these opportunities and act in harmony with your requests.—Matt. 7:7.</span></p>

Help the young people see the benefit of loyally following the direction provided through “the faithful and discreet slave.” Try to get children to comment on what goes on in connection with these activities, emphasizing the value of keeping separate.

<p><span class="font13">You can start a study and turn it over to someone who would like to conduct it. Or perhaps you could assist someone to start a study for him to conduct. Could you take someone with you when starting a study and progressively turn the study over to that one? In all these ways you may share in increasing praise to Jehovah.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>An Encouraging U.S. Service Report</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The article </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“1984 Yearbook </span><span class="font13">Highlights Worldwide Increase” in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> last month was considered on the Service Meeting during January. Now we will take a closer look at the field service report from the United States. This can be examined along with the activity of the local congregation and should encourage us in giving our full support to Kingdom activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In the United States we had a 6-percent increase in the average number of publishers. This is- the largest annual increase reported since the 1975 service year. What was the increase in your congregation by comparison? The 35,303 baptized last year represent an average of 4 for each of the 7,837 congregations in this country. How thrilling it is to see all these new ones having an active share in making known Jehovah’s name and Word! With an increase of 34,124 in the average number of publishers, it was necessary to form 167 new congregations, about 3 each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Did you conduct one or more of the 390,678 home Bible studies reported last year? If so, are these Bible students making progress toward dedication and baptism? Or perhaps you were among the 84,-285 reporting as auxiliary pioneers in April or one of the 3,317 added to the regular pioneer ranks. Whatever share you had in preaching the good news during the 1983 service year, it contributed to the excellent report.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> As we look to the future, call to mind the apostle Paul’s encouraging words recorded at Philippians 3:16: “At any rate, to what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine.” The apostle was writing about perseverance in the Christian course. Certainly our continued zealous participation as individuals in the field ministry today will result in further progress.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Can V@u Auxiliary Pioneer in March and April?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> No doubt many of you will give an unhesitating “Yes” as your answer to the above question. Your plans are already made. Others will likely reply: “Maybe ... if all goes well.” Still others could feel that auxiliary pioneering this March or April is not possible and so reply: “I would like to, but I can’t.” In what way do </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font13"> respond?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Little needs to be said to those whose plans have already beeri made, except for words of encouragement to keep such plans before Jehovah so that they will be firmly established. (Prov. 16:3) If you are uncertain at this point, we recommend that you realistically consider your circumstances and search out whatever may help you to enroll. Take advantage of the positive influences in your congregation that can encourage and motivate you. Are there regular or auxiliary pioneers in your congregation? Ask them if you can work along with them for a month or two. And since over 84,000 shared in the auxiliary pioneer work last April, very likely you will find right in your own congregation others with circumstances similar to yours who are planning to pioneer again this March and April. Talk with them. They may be able to offer helpful suggestions. Make plans with them, if possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The elders are intensely interested in helping all to increase their service to Jehovah. Feel free to approach them regarding any assistance they may be able to offer. Prayerfully consider your prospects. Seek out those in a position to encourage you; you may find you will be able to serve as an auxiliary pioneer this March and April.—Prov. 13:20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SACRIFICES NECESSARY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Even if you feel you definitely cannot pioneer, because of your personal circumstances, you may find it possible to expand your ministry during March and April by working along with the pioneers just as often as you can. Some publishers set personal goals as to the increased number of hours they will try to get in during these two months. Those who, despite difficulties, succeeded in reaching their personal goals, found that taking the matter to Jehovah in fervent prayer strengthened their determination. (Phil. 4:6) They recognized that certain things would have to be sacrificed and that vigorous exertion would be necessary. (1 Cor. 9:23; Luke 13:24) In planning their schedule, some decided to rise early each morning to ensure a full day of activity. Others cut back on recreation and other personal pursuits. Whole families have cooperated to minimize the time and effort spent on even necessary things around the home. In a sense, they have “put off every weight” and are directing all their efforts toward pioneering for a month or two. (Heb. 12:1) Many have told us about the blessings they received as a result.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> To give a few examples, a 74-year-old sister with heart problems took up the challenge. With the support of others, she succeeded and enjoyed every minute of it. A brother who is a real-estate salesman adjusted his schedule for showing homes so as to allow time for him to auxiliary pioneer. An elder who works nights rearranged his sleeping schedule so he could get his time in service. He felt rewarded by having shared in the field service with so many of his brothers and sisters. A newly baptized person was able to auxiliary pioneer with the help of her unbelieving husband. Yes, all these individuals and many more made personal sacrifices, but how richly rewarded they felt because of experiencing the blessing of Jehovah! —Prov. 10:22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAN NOW</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Now is the time to make definite plans for March and April. Elders can help by making well-organized arrangements for service, determining literature needs in advance and providing ample territory. It would also be good to keep the congregation informed as to special service arrangements through appropriate announcements. By all means make pioneering a subject of personal and congregational prayer.—1 Tim. 2:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Will we exceed the more than 29,600 who auxiliary pioneered last March and the 84,285 of last April? Those of us who can make room for auxiliary pioneering this March and April can best answer. Proverbs 10:21 tells us that “the very lips of the righteous one keep pasturing many.” May you be one whose lips will be used in this way during March and April to bless Jehovah and direct sheeplike ones onto the path of life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus Christ had “sayings of everlasting life.” (John 6:68) From whom did he receive these? In prayer to Jehovah he said: “The sayings that </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">you gave me</span><span class="font13"> I have given to them.” (John 17:8) Thus Jesus faithfully passed on to his disciples </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">information from his Father</span><span class="font13"> that dying men need in order to come into a good relationship with Jehovah and receive everlasting life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Jesus knew that his disciples would not keep this vital knowledge to themselves but would make it known to others “through their word.” (John 17:20) Today there are over two and a half million persons who possess ‘the knowledge that means everlasting life.’ (John 17:3) It is their privilege to pass on to still others this precious, lifesaving knowledge that originated with Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> There is no doubt that the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book is a fine instrument to use in helping to impart “sayings of everlasting life.” But for people to realize its value, we need to show them how the scriptures in our Topic for Conversation relate to points in the book. How have you been doing this?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FITTING ILLUSTRATIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> After reading John 17:17, you could say: “It is clear from this that Jesus Christ believed God’s Word is the truth. Nevertheless, there are many people today who wonder if the Bible is really true. Perhaps you, too, have questions about this. [Wait for response.] I have found some 'very interesting information about this question that you may appreciate. [Read paragraph 21 on page 53.]” You could then briefly go on to mention points about the Bible’s accuracy in scientific matters, in relating historical events or particularly in foretelling future events. Perhaps you could conclude with the information on pages 54 and 55 or the reasoning developed in paragraph 28 on page 56. Then offer the book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Or, after discussing John 17:17, you could say: “For something to be the truth it must be supported by facts. So, if the Bible says that we can live forever, we can rightly ask, ‘Is this based on facts or just speculation?’ It may interest you to know that informed men have said that living forever is a possibility for humans. For example, let me share with you these published comments.” Then read paragraph 4 on page 7. Aftei? making comments regarding the need to take in further knowledge of the Bible, offer the book. Of course, there are many other portions of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font13">book that could be highlighted according to the householder’s needs or interests.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">STARTING STUDIES ON THE FIRST CALL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Have you ever attempted to start a Bible study on the initial call? Not long ago a sister called on a lady who was just leaving her home to mail a letter. After placing the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book, the sister took the occasion to demonstrate a home Bible study and made arrangements for this to continue. As the sister was leaving, the woman commented that the letter she had been about to mail was addressed to a religious organization, asking them for a Bible study!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> How could you go about offering a Bible study on the first call? After placing the book, you might say: “This book is designed not just for reading but also for making a careful study Of the Scriptures. Note the questions at the bottom of the page that relate to each paragraph and the cited scriptures. To assist people with their study, we are offering a free home Bible study course. If you have a few moments, I would like to demonstrate how these discussions are conducted.” Then in a relaxed, conversational manner you can discuss a few paragraphs either in the first chapter or a portion thereof in which the householder may have shown special interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> May Jehovah bless our united efforts to share with others the lifesaving knowledge that has been entrusted to us.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Regular Pioneer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">each day to meet the pioneer .requirement, and they did so without neglecting other Christian responsibilities. These are now happily serving as regular pioneers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Undue concern for meeting the hour requirement keeps some from entering the full-time service. But Christian faith can move mountainlike obstacles, including those that spring from such apprehension. (Matt. 17:20) God’s Word and spirit, along with the good advice offered by Jehovah’s organization, can help to build such faith.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">POSITIVE ACTION NEEDED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> You will get into the pioneer work only by taking decisive steps in harmony with your prayers. What steps need to be taken? Heartfelt desire must be cultivated; you must </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font13"> to pioneer. Increase your preaching activity as much as you</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">can now and make a special effort to work with those already enrolled. Observe their joy. This will help you develop the pioneer spirit. Do not dwell on the negative factors in your circumstances. (Eccl. 11:4) Rather, seek to imitate Nehemiah’s positive attitude regarding rebuilding Jerusalem’s walls in the face of obstacles. He said; “The God of the heavens is the One that will grant us success, and we ourselves, his servants, shall get up, and we must build.”—Neh. 2:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Pioneer work will open up many more opportunities to experience the special joy that comes from helping others to know and serve Jehovah. And by expanding your ministry as a regular pioneer, you will find the refreshment suggested at Proverbs 11:25, that of being freely watered spiritually yourself because of your “freely watering others” with the Word of life.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Continue to Speak the Word of God Fearlessly</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Observing Jesus’ boldness in speaking, the people of Jerusalem exclaimed: “This is the man they are seeking to kill, is it not? And yet, see! he is speaking in public.” (John 7:25, 26) Jesus set the example as a fearless preacher of the Word of God. Jehovah had given him a work to do, and he was not going to allow fear of man to intimidate himanto silence. This same fearlessness was implanted in his faithful disciples. In their final meeting together he commanded his disciples to preach and teach the message of the Kingdom far and wide. They did so, fearlessly. —Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 1:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">DO WE SPEAK FEARLESSLY?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Today, in this country, we are not faced with persecution to the extent experienced by the first-century Christians. Nevertheless, you may be tested by more subtle fears. For example, are you fearful of speaking with strangers? Or do you have a fear of making return visits, feeling you will not know what to say? Some are apprehensive about working affluent territory. Young people often shy away from speaking with other young ones about the Kingdom message. Similarly, some are fearful</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>The Blessings of</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” (Ps. 133:1) Does this not express the sentiments of those who loyally support Jehovah’s organization and its activities? The spiritual achievements of the last service year indicate that this is so. There have been many reasons to express these words of the psalmist. Let us review some of these.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">BLESSINGS EXPERIENCED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Fresh on our mind is the “Kingdom Increase” District Convention. The program increased our appreciation for the privilege we have to be living during this time of Kingdom increase. It is clear that Jehovah is having a tremendous work done at this time, and we were encouraged to have a full share. (Neh. 6:16) Now is the time to put into practice the many fine suggestions offered regarding our Christian living and activity. This will strengthen us for the difficult times ahead.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Another encouraging aspect of the past service year was the effort many put forth in the pioneer work, as shown in the April report. There were 123,442 who shared in the pioneer work that month, 19 per-about speaking with employers or fellow employees. What is the solution? The apostles prayed for divine assistance. (Acts 4:29) Satan tries to make us fearful, to destroy our unselfish desire to help others. But we can be assured that when we bring the good news to others, Jehovah will support us.—2 Chron. 20:15; Acts 4:31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> During September, we can share in this work by offering </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories.</span><span class="font10"> Since these books have been in use now for a few years, you may find householders who already have them. What then? You can demonstrate how they can get the most benefit from a home Bible study. Very likely there was some initial interest when they took the publications. Perhaps that interest can be rekindled and cultivated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> If you have not yet become proficient in using the Topic for Conversation, why not rehearse it with others before going out in the field? This will increase your confidence at the door and strengthen you to preach the Word fearlessly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 2)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Serving Jehovah</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">cent of the total number of publishers. Of the 12,954,379 hours spent in field service, 8,013,900 were reported by pioneers. That was over 61 percent of the total number of hours! A fine shout of praise indeed!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Field service reports also indicate that the increase in those sharing in the Kingdom-preaching work is greater than the number who were baptized. This would seem to indicate that many have become reactivated, and others have seen the need to be more regular in the field service. Do you know of still others who can be encouraged to have a greater share? Can you help? If so, we suggest that you discuss this with your book study conductor or another elder.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">PERSONAL GOALS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah is speeding up things toward a climax before the outbreak of the great tribulation. This adds a note of urgency to our work, and the path that has been marked out for us is clear. With this in mind, would it not be good to examine our individual situation and set meaningful personal goals for the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 2</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font10">Selected Announcements in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font10"> “Literature Price Changes.” Discuss with audience. Brother handling this part will also make local announcements, review congregational arrangements for field service and encourage publishers to share in field service on weekend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">“Continue to Speak the Word of God Fearlessly.” Question-and-answer discussion, preferably by service overseer. When discussing paragraph 4, tie in local figures on regularity, and give suggestions that will help publishers prevent irregularity. Emphasize importance of keeping an accurate record of field service activity and reporting promptly at the end of each month. Special effort should be made to be in field service the first Sunday and the second and fourth Saturdays each month. Encourage having personal goal of sharing in the field service each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font10">“Enduring With Life in View.” A talk by an elder with a few appropriate questions, based on chapter 14 of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Song 160 and concluding prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">1985 service year? Many have found this helpful in keeping their attention focused on those things they would especially like to accomplish.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Can you arrange to auxiliary pioneer during the 1985 service year? The months of September and December 1984, as well as March and June 1985, all have five Saturdays and five Sundays. The month of August has five Saturdays. Could you auxiliary pioneer during one or more of those months? Or, is this the year you may be able to join the regular pioneer ranks? Give this your prayerful consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> As we increase our share in the field ministry we should also concentrate on improving the quality of our service. Last September we started a series of articles in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> on “Improving</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">“The Blessings of Serving Jehovah.” Question-and-answer coverage. Have audience comment on upbuilding experiences they had during the 1984 service year and express what they hope to do during 1985 service year. One or two such experiences could be prepared in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: </span><span class="font10">Review and demonstrate use of current Topic for Conversation. Encourage all to share in field service this weekend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Song 129 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING SEPTEMBER 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Song 139</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font10">Local announcements. Accounts report. Encourage field, service on fourth Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">“Presenting the Good News —To Young People.” Question-and-answer consideration. After considering paragraph 7, cite articles in current magazines that especially appeal to young people. Present a brief demonstration of speaking with a young person in house-to-house ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">“Do You Remember?” Discussion between a Congregation Book Study conductor and two other publishers. Introduce part with expressions of appreciation for abundance of spiritual food provided by ‘faithful slave’ and for helpful reminders that contribute to our spiritual advancement. Then proceed to discuss specific points set out in “Do You Remember?” feature of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font10"> (w84 4/15 p. 31; 8/15 p. 31) Encourage all to give</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our Teaching Ability.” Why not review these articles and write down some of the key points? They could be kept in your Bible as reminders.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Starting a new Bible study would be another worthy goal. Make this a matter of prayer and work at it, concentrating on those who have accepted literature or have otherwise shown interest. When a Bible study is started, begin right away to direct this new interest to Jehovah’s organization. There are some very fine suggestions on this in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry </span><span class="font10">book, pages 91 and 92.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Do you have a good schedule for personal study? This is necessary in order to resist Satan’s attempts to destroy our faith. Some find it helpful to get up early in the morning and read while it is quiet and they are alert. Others have set aside cerspecial attention to this feature of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> each time it appears.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Local needs or use an appropriate Service Meeting part missed during week of district convention.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">Song 211</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font10">Local announcements. Outline local arrangements for midweek and weekend field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">“Benefiting Fully From </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower and Awake!”</span><span class="font10"> Consider with audience. Read paragraphs as time permits. Encourage audience to prepare for October’s subscription offer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">HOW WE BENEFIT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> When we have personal subscriptions, we are assured of getting every magazine in advance of the issue date, thus allowing us to examine them carefully before offering them in the field. Home delivery of the magazines is spaced evenly, approximately one issue per week, providing a steady supply of spiritual food and at the same time allowing for a balanced schedule for reading. Children can also benefit by having their personal subscriptions. If you have not already subscribed, give serious thought to doing so this very week.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The first Sunday and the second and fourth Saturdays of each month are special field service days. We suggest that you reserve these days, especially, for sharing in the field ministry. Note that the Society’s calendar marks these days, reminding us that they afford special opportunities for service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Our purpose in preaching involves more than just leaving literature with interested persons. To make disciples, we must make return visits. Renew your conversation by referring to the previous visit, mentioning some of the points you discussed. Have something specific in mind from the publication that you want to highlight. This will make the person aware of the value of the literature and perhaps provide you with an opportunity to demonstrate a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> What a joy it is to see so many accepting the truth! By our fearlessly preaching the Word of God, we show our love for Jehovah and his Son. Enthusiasm for this preaching commission will help us resist Satan’s attacks and show “all the more courage to speak the word of God fearlessly.”—Phil. 1:14. sit down and read at least one or two articles immediately and then all the rest just as soon as you can?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Looking Ahead to the December Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">With the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Society is preparing a 1984 edition of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">bil2</span><span class="font10"> (regular-size) Bible in English with marginal references for use in the December Bible campaign. In addition to placing it in the field, no doubt publishers would like to have a copy of this edition for their own use. Having this in mind, congregations may place their orders beginning September 1, 1984. No more of the 1981 edition Bible will be sent to congregations. Congregations that have a stock of Bibles with either black or green covers should endeavor to move them off their shelves before the new stock is received. If you have an excess stock of any of these Bibles, please contact nearby congregations who may be in need of Bibles and arrange a transfer of some of your stock to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The cost for the various Bibles will be as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1971 edition in English (green cover) (Congregation and public: $2.50; pioneers: $1.25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1981 edition (black cover) (Congregation and public: $3.00; pioneers: $1.50)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1984 edition (Congregation and public: $3.50; pioneers: $1.75)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Are you prepared to present the good news to the young people in your territory? Or are you somewhat hesitant and perhaps inclined to abbreviate your presentation when a young person comes to the door? The good news of God is for all people, whether young or old.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">A POSITIVE ATTITUDE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Do not assume because the person you encounter is young in years that he is indifferent to religious subjects or is oblivious to world conditions. Rather, take advantage of the opportunity and speak enthusiastically about Jehovah’s wonderful promises. View the person as a prospective disciple, just as you do when someone older comes to the door. True, many young ones have been influenced by the teaching of evolution, and some may have little regard for moral principles. However, a recent survey among college students found that over 80 percent agreed that religious practices are important, and another study revealed that the majority of young people today do, as the survey put it, “believe in God or in a universal spirit.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Many youths are concerned about the future and what it holds for them. Often young people are quite willing to listen and then express themselves on this subject. So when a yourlg person comes to the door, do not hesitate to begin a Scriptural discussion. Be positive and strive to reach his heart. We do not want to ignore the spiritual needs of the many young people in our territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Our current Topic for Conversation “Will the Earth Be Destroyed in a Nuclear War?” affords an excellent opportunity to get the attention of young adults. The</span></p>

Can we get their viewpoint on the subject and start a conversation? Many of them will be surprised to learn that the Bible supplies a very comforting answer to this disturbing question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">BE PREPARED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Be prepared to meet young people and have information ready that will appeal to them. In every issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> you will find one or more articles that will be of special interest to young people. For example, during the month of September we can approach young ones with articles such as “You Can Have a Happy Future,” “The Persistent Plague—The Sexual Revolution’s Dark Side” and “Telescopes and Microscopes—Have Their Revelations Undermined or Strengthened Your Faith?” Become acquainted with these articles ; it will help you to be prepared to present the good news to the young people you meet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If you are likely to encounter college students in the territory, you may want to carry an </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font10"> book or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Bible Really the Word of God ?</span><span class="font10"> Or what about having a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Family Life</span><span class="font10"> book for offering to young married couples? In most cases it will not be difficult to carry these small publications in addition to the current offer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> By having a positive attitude, getting acquainted with material that is published specifically for young people and by carrying additional publications tailored to their particular needs, we will be prepared. Millions of young people are sincerely looking for solutions to the problems they face. Many are responding to the Kingdom good news. We are concerned about the welfare of all mankind, regardless of age. So let our genuine concern move us to prepare well and make an appealing presentation of the good news to the young people we meet in our territory. We may be able‘to help some young person to “flee from the desires incidental to youth” in this old system and “pursue righteousness” with everlasting life in view.—2 Tim. 2:22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE PRICE CHANGES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As this world’s system of things totters toward its destruction, all of us are affected by its instability.

Therefore, it has become necessary to increase the prices on a number of the Society’s publications.</span></p></li>

This charge, which will appear on one of your monthly statements shortly thereafter, will not create a deficit in your account, as it is offset by the increased value of literature you have on hand. When completing the September 1 Literature Inventory form, please calculate the value of literature on hand at the prices listed on the form.

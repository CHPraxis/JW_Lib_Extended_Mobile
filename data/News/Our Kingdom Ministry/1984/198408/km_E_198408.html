</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The above words of urgency were sent to Joshua by the Gibeonites when five enemy kings allied themselves in battle against them. Would Joshua and the Israelites now relax their hand because of recent victories and not respond to the Gibeonites’ cry for help? The Bible tells us that Joshua and his valiant mighty men along with all the people of war marched all night to take the five enemy kings by surprise and rout them. Jehovah granted his loyal and tireless servants total victory, and the Gibeonites were saved.—Josh. 10:6-27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> No longer do Jehovah’s earthly servants engage in carnal warfare. Our warfare, as Christians, is spiritual. However, in our spiritual warfare we can imitate the zeal and loyalty of Joshua and his valiant mighty men. Jehovah has indeed blessed our labors in the disciple-making work, and great success is being realized. But is this the time to relax our hand because of the success we have enjoyed thus far? Not at all. Now is the time to be like Joshua and his men and not let up in our zealous preaching and disciple making.—Matt. 28: 19,20; 2 Cor. 10:4, 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Millions of people have shown interest in the Kingdom message by accepting literature such as the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font12"> books. They need our help. And, since the offer for August and September is either one of these books on a contri</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acting With Insight During Our Spiritual Harvest</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Under the direction of Jesus and in cooperation with his angelic reapers, a great spiritual harvest is now taking place in the earth. Just as in ancient Israel, Jehovah has outlined specific requirements governing both the work and the workers in this modern harvesttime. What a privilege we have to share wholeheartedly in this Kingdom ingathering! Appreciation for our blessed opportunities should move us to work with diligence and insight, intensely occupying ourselves with the witnessing work.—Prov. 10:4, 5; Acts 18:4, 5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“BE AGLOW WITH THE SPIRIT&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> This great modern-day harvest requires energetic, spirited activity. (See Romans 12:11, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Interlinear.</span><span class="font12"> ) We act with insight when we imitate faithful early Christians who had a regular, zealous share in the ministry. Like them, we recognize the importance of engaging faithfully in the holy work of bution of $2.50, what fine potential there is for many thousands of new home Bible studies to be started.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT CAN WE DO?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> First of all, we should consider each individual with whom books have been placed as worthy of return visits. Hence, it would be good to organize our house-to-house records in order to make these visits. In making the return visits, we should have as our purpose starting a home Bible study. Even when going from door to door, why not offer to demonstrate to the householder how a home Bible study is conducted? Many who are now our brothers and sisters were first introduced to the Bible study arrangement in this manner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Are you presently conducting a home Bible study with an interested person? If you are, you likely know the joy that comes from teaching someone the truth. Could you arrange your affairs to conduct an additional Bible study? It would be good to examine your personal schedule to determine if you can make room to help even more in this way. Your joy and satisfaction can also be increased by helping another publisher in the congregation start and conduct a home Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>s</sup> If you are not presently conducting a home Bible study, but you genuinely would like to, there are some positive steps you can take. First of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font12"> I) preaching the good news, since this present-day activity is a chief reason for the very formation of the Christian congregation. (Matt. 24:14) Our love for Jehovah and heartfelt obedience to our preaching commission move us to put Kingdom interests first. We eagerly follow the inspired advice given to God’s ministers in Hezekiah’s time: “Do not give yourselves up to rest.” —2 Chron. 29:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> As we continue to discern the meaning of this harvesttime, we want to participate </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">regularly</span><span class="font12"> in making known “the things having to do with peace.” (Luke 19:42, 44; Acts 5:42) Could you arrange to share regularly in all features of the ministry? Rich blessings from Jehovah await all whose circumstances allow them to do so. We are refreshed by personal experiences in the ministry, and our “acting with insight” becomes a wholesome influ-</span></p>

<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font12">“What do you think of the Olympic Games? Are the high ideals of sportsmanship important, or are these on the way out?” Allow householder to reply. Publisher continues by saying: “Notice here on page 2 of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> what it says about the matter.” Publisher shows page 2 to householder and reads or discusses paragraph under heading “Feature Articles.” Publisher concludes by saying: “I am sure that you will find these articles very interesting. These issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">are yours for a contribution of 30 cents.” Encourage brothers to make brief presentations of the magazines and to share in this service Saturday.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">22 min: &quot;Do Not Let Your Hand Relax.” Question-and-answer discussion. Make local application of material so that those in attendance will appreciate potential in congregation for increased activity, which will result in more home Bible studies. Read paragraphs and selected scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">18 min: Topic for Conversation. Discuss and demonstrate. Why is this question so appropriate now? Read and discuss each scripture, stressing each teaching point. Have two well-prepared and experienced publishers make model presentations, using suggested scriptures. One publisher to offer the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book, showing illustration on pages 12 and 13, then reading to householder paragraph 15 on page 14. Simplicity of starting a Bible study in the book can be commented on. Thereafter, the other publisher, using the same Scriptural presentation, will offer the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stones</span><span class="font12"> book, directing the householder’s interest to story 115. Help all to appreciate simplicity of such presentations. As time permits, get comments from brothers about success they have had in using these books to start studies. Encourage all to learn Scriptural presentation and to share in house-to-house ministry first Sunday of month, August 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;z?</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">15 min: Prepare locally according to needs. This time may be used to interview publishers in the congregation on how they got the truth.

<p><span class="font12">Song 214 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">WEEK STARTING AUGUST 26</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">20 min: “Presenting the Good News —In School.” Question-and-answer discussion. Warmly encourage youths to uphold the truth fearlessly and respectfully, and to share their hope with classmates and teachers. When paragraph 7 is considered, get comments from parents on how they have presented the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font12"> brochure to teachers, what the results have been, and so forth. With new term starting, many students will have new teachers, classmates and others who may know nothing about Jehovah’s Witnesses. This means additional opportunities to place the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font12"> brochure and provide a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Young People Ask... How Can I Make Kids Stop Picking on Me?” (g84 2/22 pp. 21-3) Talk and discussion based on article. May also include exemplary youth in discussion.

<p><span class="font12">all, present the matter in prayer to Jehovah. Also, ask the service overseer for suggestions. Your Congregation Book Study conductor or another experienced publisher may be able to help. Some publishers have had fine success in starting studies by merely offering to read the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book with interested persons. For more information on how to start Bible studies in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book, see page 4 of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> for February 1983.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Disciples are made, not born. So, a person does not usually make real spiritual progress until a home Bible study is conducted with him with the aid of one of the Society’s publications. Since we appreciate their spiritual value, we want to give the widest possible distribution to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font12"> books. As we do, may we keep in mind the tireless zeal of Joshua as well as the encouraging words of the wise man: “Do not let your hand rest; for you are not knowing where this will have success, either here or there, or whether both of them will alike be good.”—Eccl. 11:6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Good Manners in Field Service Honor God</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians: “In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling, that our ministry might not be found fault with.” (2 Cor. 6:3) Consequently, he recommended to the Philippians that they “behave in a manner worthy of the good news.” (Phil. 1:27) This inspired counsel clearly brings to the fore that Christian manners are important. Do your manners in the field service honor God?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> What are manners? Manners are defined as habitual conduct, behavior or deportment and refer to our way of dealing with others. Expressions associated with good manners are politeness, courtesy, thoughtfulness, considerateness, kindness and tact. Good manners may seem insignificant to some people, but not so to Christians. We recognize that much of what we as Christians accomplish can be undone by a lack of good manners.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IN HOUSE-TO-HOUSE WORK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> AS you walk from one house to the other, do you display the dignity expected of a minister of God? Does your appearance and deportment harmonize with the seriousness of the message you are presenting? Obviously, we want our children with us in the ministry, but are they being trained to represent the truth appropriately? Are they attentive and not playing while the publisher is speaking to the householder? If the children are unruly or their conduct is distracting, the householder may not get the full benefit of what the publisher has to say. Children who receive good training bring honor to Jehovah, their parents and the congregation. Commenting on two young brothers who preached the good news to her, a woman said it was a “real pleasure to talk to these ... neatly dressed young people, and I wish that more young people would follow their example.&quot; She was</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER SPIRIT ON THE INCREASE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> How heartwarming to observe that each year thousands of our brothers ‘perceive the will of Jehovah’ to include their accepting the opportunities and challenges of the full-time ministry! (Eph. 5:17) Last year during the month of August, a peak of 2,727 new regular pioneer applications were approved in this country. How we rejoiced then to have nearly 28,000 regular pioneers at the start of the new service year! Are you in position to reach out for such service privileges? obviously impressed by their appearance and good manners.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> How are good manners displayed when we speak? The apostle Peter states that in speaking we should reveal “a mild temper and deep respect.” (1 Pet. 3:15) This is very important and even more so when dealing with unreasonable persons. If we speak in a dogmatic, harsh or overbearing way, can it be said that our manners honor God? Good manners require tact and friendliness. We should not be overly insistent that the householder accept literature or listen to our message if he does not wish to do so. Also, it is important to be a good listener, since this too is a part of Christian manners. When the householder speaks, we should listen to what he has to say. This shows respect. We will then know what is on his mind and be better equipped to help him.—Prov. 18:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> As we work the territory, good manners dictate that we avoid congregating on the sidewalks or in front of buildings. Passersby should not be required to walk around us. This is important too when engaging in street work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ON RETURN VISITS AND BIBLE STUDIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> When in another person’s home, Christian manners dictate that we comport ourselves as guests, showing appreciation for the hospitality extended and maintaining proper decorum. The one conducting a study or making a return visit should respect the time the householder allows for the visit. He should be punctual. If the publisher is accompanied by children, these should respect the householder and his property. In no way would we want to give cause for stumbling or faultfinding.—2 Cor. 6:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Unquestionably, good manners in field service honor Jehovah God. May we all continue to “behave in a manner worthy of the good news.”—Phil. 1:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If you have finished high school this year, what is holding you back from pioneering? As a family group, could arrangements be made for one or more of your family members to pioneer? Some have found it possible to cut back on secular work in order to pioneer for at least a year. Have you seriously considered this possibility? Whatever your circumstances may be, pray to Jehovah about expanding your ministry as you seek to act with insight in demonstrating the pioneer spirit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> May we all continue “to have a heart for working,” keeping busy in Jehovah’s service. (Neh. 4:6; 1 Cor. 15:58) Our acting unitedly with insight will result in dewlike refreshment and great joy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">( </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In School</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As September approaches, millions of young people will be returning to school. There the students will spend much time each school day, gaining knowledge and skills that will help them later on as adults. However, these young people may also be subjected to unscriptural philosophies, empty theories and views condoning or promoting loose morals. They will be called upon to make important decisions about their future without being given any spiritual guidance. While this large territory is almost completely off limits to adults, there are many young publishers who also attend school and are able to share the good news with honesthearted ones.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WAYS TO WITNESS IN SCHOOL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> While in school, some young Witnesses have found it effective to have the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book or the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font12"> book with them. One young brother leaves one of these books right on top of his desk. When classmates ask about the book, it opens the way for a discussion. Thus, a good witness is given to students and teachers, and he has even started several Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Another young Witness takes advantage of opportunities during the lunch hour to speak to different students about the Kingdom. She says she finds it very easy to open the conversation by talking about something currently being discussed in one of their classes. Then she directs attention to an article on a similar subject in one of the recent </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">magazines. This young sister has also been able to make return visits and start Bible studies right at school.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Young Witnesses may also have opportunities to present the good news in connection with class reports or projects. In one classroom the students were assigned to present scientific information in proof of evolution. A young brother approached the teacher aftei<sup>i</sup> class and asked if he could present scientific material supporting creation. The teacher agreed. The result was an outstanding oral report by the brother, which was applauded by his classmates. The teacher was so impressed that he arranged for the report to be presented to other classes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> In a number of cases arrangements have been made for qualified elders to speak to groups of students in school. They have explained more about our teachings and activities and have even shown a set of the Society’s slides. Not only students but teachers and school officials have benefited.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR CONDUCT AS A WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>G</sup> Young ones also do well to reflect upon the effect their personal conduct has on the truth, either in recommending the good news or detracting from it. A number of teachers have come to a knowledge of the truth as a result of the good conduct of Witness children in school. Contrastingly, the attitude and behavior of worldly students is often disrespectful. They are lazy, careless about their work and disobedient in class. They often get into serious trouble. Onlookers usually do not point critically to their religion. But what happens when the student is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Because of the high standards that we uphold and that the organization is known for, we must always be careful to maintain right conduct. May our conduct always be in harmony with Jehovah’s regulations and thus bring him honor.—Ps. 119:9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Parents can play an important part in getting the cooperation of teachers. One sister was reluctant to approach her daughter’s new teacher because of a report that the teacher was uncooperative and difficult to deal with. Finally the sister approached the teacher in a tactful and kind way and pointed out her desire to cooperate with him in his difficult job. The sister concluded by offering the teacher the brochure </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">School and Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span><span class="font12"> The teacher accepted the brochure and later said that he read it from beginning to end. During that school year his attitude toward the Witness youth demonstrated that he appreciated what he had read in the brochure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> If you are a young Witness returning to school and it is your earnest desire to help your honesthearted classmates, speak up about the good news and be assured of Jehovah’s pleasure and blessing.—Ps. 148:12, 13.</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Circuit Assemblies —Practical Counsel</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The 1984 spring and summer circuit assembly program with the theme “Living No Longer for Ourselves” presented timely information to help us avoid selfish thinking. In order for life to be meaningful, one has to be interested first of all in doing Jehovah’s will and pleasing him. (2 Cor. 5:14,15) We must be capable of distinguishing both right and wrong. (Heb. 5:14) Appreciating our place in Jehovah's house, we may serve as vessels for an honorable use.—Rom. 9:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The theme for the series of circuit assemblies starting in September is “Repudiate Ungodliness and Worldly Desires.” Why does the Bible instruct us to reject such? (Titus 2:12) How does such a course of action afford us protection, and why is it essential to our salvation? What are some of the specific areas of ungodliness and worldly desires that pose dangers to Jehovah’s people? Why should we view some of our own personal desires as suspect? These and many other vital questions will be answered in this new circuit assembly program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Portions of the program such as “Pioneering Is Advantageous” and “Examining Our Motives&quot; will help strengthen our determination to maintain ourselves active in Jehovah’s service as well as to remain clean and separate from the world. Be sure to make definite plans to attend this excellent circuit assembly program.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Making Your Family Life Happy</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In these last days, pressures upon the family arrangement continue to mount. (2 Tim. 3:1-5; Rev. 12:12) Traditional family life has been disrupted as never before. How can we fortify our family life? What protection is there for Christians?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The Founder of the family arrangement consistently demonstrates his interest in us. (Eph. 3: 14, 15) By means of his Word and organization he gives guidance and instruction that strengthen our families and the Christian congregation. The book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Making Your Family Life Happy</span><span class="font12"> was published in 1978 and has proved its worth in helping us to apply Bible principles in a realistic and beneficial way. Now arrangements have been made for us to study it again at the Congregation Book Study, beginning the first week of September.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> To gain the greatest benefit from our discussions, each of us should prepare well. All of us need to benefit from the modest, straightforward counsel found in this publication.</span></p></li></ul>

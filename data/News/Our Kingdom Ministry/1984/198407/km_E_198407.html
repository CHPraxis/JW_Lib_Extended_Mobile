<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TREMENDOUS WITNESS GIVEN DURING APRIL REPORT SHOWS NEW PEAK OF 662,520 PUBLISHERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Activity, Including Pioneer Ranks, on the Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The April report was truly outstanding! It gives strong evidence of Jehovah's abundant favor and blessings upon our united efforts to make known his provisions for salvation. (Ps. 67:1,2) We are thankful to our God for what has been accomplished as indicated below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Total Publishers: 662,520. This surpasses our March peak by 10,202.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Total Auxiliary Pioneers: 93,990. An increase of 9,705 over the peak in April of last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Regular Pioneers: 29,098. This exceeds our March peak by 199.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Total Hours: 12,954,379. This is over one million more hours than our peak in April a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Return Visits: 4,395,110. Exceeds our previous peak by 346,629.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Home Bible Studies: 450,658. This is 8,554 more than our peak last month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The above increases enhance, in a most fitting way, the theme of our conventions this summer. Along with hundreds of thousands who will attend the “Kingdom Increase” District Conventions this month, let us bless our God, Jehovah, and pray that the volume of praise to him may be greatly increased throughout all the earth.—Ps. 66:8.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Under the Law covenant the Israelites were to offer sound animals from their flocks in sacrifice. Even the grain offerings of the poor were to be of “fine” flour. (Lev. 1:3; 2:1) We today are also under obligation to make sacrifices to God, and regardless of our personal circumstances, these sacrifices must represent our very best. But what sacrifices are Christians to offer? Paul said: “Let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.”—Heb. 13:15,16.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> It is Jehovah’s will “that all sorts of men should be saved.” (1 Tim. 2: 3,4) Indeed, the Christian congregation is made up of a wide variety of individuals, each with differing abilities and personalities. What can each one of us do to help others grow spiritually and remain strong in the faith?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> No matter what our circumstances, each one of us can be a source of encouragement to others. As individuals we can share in supplying “what is needed” in accord with Ephesians 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GIVE WHAT IS NEEDED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Twb important things emphasized in this verse will serve to build up the congregation. These are </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">cooperation</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">love.</span><span class="font13"> Thoughtful effort is necessary in order to extend ourselves in behalf of others.

<p><span class="font13">preaching and teaching work Jesus foretold for our day. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) With the great tribulation fast approaching, we want to do all we can to help those who are hungering and thirsting for the truth. (Matt. 5:6) Not only would we want to spend as much time as possible sharing in the field ministry, but we would want to offer our best in doing so.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The quality of our ministry de- ' pends to a great extent on the effort we put forth.

<p><span class="font13">may need help to share in the ministry each month. Can you help? Sometimes parents can be of assistance to one another by taking turns baby-sitting when there are a number of small children who cannot accompany them in the field service. Parents should take the initiative to teach their children suitable presentations that they can use in the door-to-door ministry. Have you taught them to use a simple magazine presentation? If they can read, have you taught them a Scriptural presentation? Such effort demonstrates yobr love for and support of the congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DIRECTING INTEREST TO THE ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> How important it is for all of us to direct interested ones to the organization! Explain the Congregation Book Study arrangement to Bible students and invite them to come along to the study with you, perhaps arranging to bring them. Help them to get acquainted with others before and after the book study. Tell them about the Public Meeting and priate, you may request to speak with others in the establishment, stating that you will be brief and not unduly disrupt their work schedule.)</span></p>

By sitting with them, sharing your songbook and having an extra copy of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> ready, you will also help them to feel at ease. The sooner new ones begin attending meetings the faster they will progress in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> You may know of some who attended the Memorial but are not yet publishing. Our desire is to help them become dedicated, baptized Witnesses who actively follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. (1 Pet. 2:21) Time and thoughtful attention given to the needs of such ones is recting interest to the organization. Discuss with them why there is a need to do this early in the study and have them outline what they do to help Bible students begin associating with the congregation and make progress toward dedication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Preparing magazine presentations. Father reviews 30- to 60-second magazine presentations with family. Refers to &quot;Feature Articles” paragraph on page 2 of the July 22, 1984, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> Helps family members prepare following presentation: “Unemployment is a major world problem. It is even high in the United States. Is there anything families can do to lessen its impact? What may help in finding a job? If no jobs are available, what other possibilities are there? Whether your family is currently affected by unemployment or not, the articles starting on page 3 will be of benefit to you. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font13">and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> are available for a contribution of 30c.” Father takes several recent issues of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> and shows how easy it is to use “Feature Articles” section on page 2 of each issue to develop brief, simple magazine presentations. He shows another family member how to develop a presentation from the August 1, 1984, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower:</span><span class="font13"> “Many persons question the existence of God. Others believe in God and would like to be closer to him. This issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> raises the question ‘How Close Is God to You?’ It shows how young ones can be helped to be close to God. This vital information together with the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font13">is yours for 30c.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 194 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">necessary for that goal to be realized.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Elders and ministerial servants especially have the privilege of supporting others in the congregation. They are encouraged to note the needs of the flock and then work to help “each respective, member in due measure.” They also support the congregation by exerting themselves in the field service, sine? their good example is encouraging to all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> David observed, “How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” (Ps. 133:1) The full support of each one, giving what is needed, directly contributes to the unity and prosperity of the congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Blessings of Pioneering</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “These three years have been the happiest in my life.” “My greatest blessing is the new strengthened relationship I have with Jehovah.” “I have tried it out for the first time last month, and I wish I had tried it before ... I really found joy and peace of mind.” These are comments made by some who have experienced the blessings of serving as regular and auxiliary pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Such comments are not unusual when you consider what is stated at 2 Corinthians 9:6: “He that sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.” Logically those who do more in the service will reap greater joy and blessings. (Acts 20:35) Some whose circumstances do not permit them to meet the requirement of hours for regular pioneers arrange their affairs so as to auxiliary pioneer each month. Others plan to auxiliary pioneer as often as they can-. Often the interest found by auxiliary pioneers in just one month results in so many return visits and Bible studies that it keeps them very busy for several months to come.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Similarly others, although not able to auxiliary pioneer, have been able to increase their share in the ministry. They reap many blessings as a result of ‘sowing bountifully.’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT BLESSINGS?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> After auxiliary pioneering for a full year, one brother wrote to thank the Society for encouraging this activity. Describing the joy and benefits received, he said: ‘‘I have become surer of myself at the door and a better teacher . . . The most joy has come from studying the Bible with people.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Regular pioneers have had similar experiences. One sister said: “I have only been a regular pioneer for a little over a year now. In this be of the greatest help to him. We could ask ourselves, ‘What points should be emphasized for the benefit of this person? How can I help him to apply what he learns?’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">REGULARLY OFFER SACRIFICES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Offering our best includes being regular in the ministry. Remember, Hebrews 13:15 says: “Let us </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">always </span><span class="font13">offer to God a sacrifice of praise.” Are we </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">regularly</span><span class="font13"> offering such sacrifices? The more frequently we go out in the house-to-house work the more familiar we become with the needs of the householders. Through experience we become better time my faith has certainly increased by means of Jehovah’s motivating spirit. ... If I knew then what I know now in regard to the joy experienced from being a fulltime proclaimer of the good news, I would have started in the regular pioneer work much sooner.” Another said: “It has provided for me a stability in decision-making I never had. When truly hard decisions came up, I asked myself, how will my pioneering be affected? My answers became easier. Pioneering has helped me to see how true the words at Acts 20:35 really are.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> The Pioneer Service School is another blessing available to those who have been regular pioneers for at least a year. What do those who have attended this school have to say? “I found it the highlight of my pioneering career.” “I have really learned how to study, meditate and use my time more wisely.” “The school helped me to rely more upon Jehovah and to see the need to keep busy in his work.” “I feel as if I have a tremendous foundation to begin to build on. Certainly we can’t apply all the information at once, but what a spiritual banquet to reflect upon. A sure fight against discouragement!”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CAN YOU BE A REGULAR PIONEER?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> If you have been serving regularly as an auxiliary pioneer, likely you have had to make some adjustments in your schedule and perhaps even changed your life-style to some extent. Did you not find these changes to be worth the effort when compared with the blessings you received? With improved scheduling, would you be able to increase your time in the field service each day and begin serving as a regular pioneer in September? We encourage you to give this your prayerful consideration.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">equipped to present the good news effectively.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> During July it is suggested that we offer the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;</span><span class="font13"> book in our regular field activity. Doing so, we will be focusing the attention of individuals on the theme of God’s Word, his Kingdom. We want to help people grow in appreciation for that message and come to the point where they, too, will praise Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> If we reflect with appreciation on everything that Jehovah has done for us, we will be moved always to offer our very best to him. — IChron. 29:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font13">have been vital tools in declaring the good news. These magazines have helped many to gain an accurate knowledge of God’s .Word. In fact over 258,000,000 magazines were distributed last year in spreading the good news in many lands and languages. We want to use these tools to the full in presenting the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BY DEVELOPING MAGAZINE ROUTES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> For more than 44 years we have been encouraged to establish magazine routes. Do you have one? If so, you are no doubt enjoying the benefits and blessings of this feature of service. One brother who has had a magazine route since 1955 currently has 50 individuals who regularly take the magazines. What a productive way of spreading the good news! How did he establish such a route? He attributes his success to a simple, direct approach. After he places magazines with someone for the first time, he says: “I’d like to come back and show you the next issues when they come out.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> One key to starting and maintaining a magazine route is to be regular in the magazine activity. It is also important to keep good house-to-house records. Think in terms of starting a magazine route. When you place the magazines, stimulate the householder’s interest in future copies. How? One sevenyear-old publisher who has 11 individuals on his route uses the information under the heading: “In Our Next Issue,” as well as “Young People Ask,” “God’s Word Is Alive” or other regular feature articles to generate interest in future magazines. Your own enthusiastic attitude toward these articles will help to stimulate the householder’s interest.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> To be of real benefit to those on your magazine route, do not view householders simply as individuals with whom to place magazines on a regular basis. Consider how you can help them to cultivate further interest in God’s Word. Raise questions that can be answered by directing attention to a particular article in the magazine, thus building appreciation for the material contained in the articles. As you continue your calls and become better acquainted with the householder, he may feel more comfortable in talking with you, and this may pave the way for starting a Bible study. However, patience and persistence are necessary. One brother had been regularly taking magazines to a woman for two years. She was impressed by the brother’s faithfulness in coming back month after month and, as a result, a Bible study was started not only with her but also with her husband, two daughters and grandson. —Gal. 6:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">STORE-TO-STORE WORK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Another feature of the magazine activity that can bring good results is the store-to-store work. However, discernment is needed. Being brief and direct is important. Presentations that are no more than 30 to 60 seconds in length are most appropriate. Selecting a time of day that is not such a busy period will assist in getting better results when working business territory. Keep in mind the importance of being well dressed, thus giving a dignified appearance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">• One sister who is successful in the store-to-store activity first mentions that since she does not usually find business people when calling at their home, an effort is being made to reach them at their place of work. Then she refers to an article she is presenting and states she is sure they will want the information not only for themselves but also to share with their family. Again, the point to remember in going from store to store is to be brief and to the point.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> In this very busy world it is vital to be diligent in presenting the good news wherever we find people. Calling from store to store and establishing magazine routes are excellent ways to reach people with the good news.</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Kingdom Hall Expansion Program</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The September 1983 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> insert explained how congregations may contribute to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. Since then, such contributions have been coming in to the Society’s office month by month. Your unselfish support of the Kingdom Hall expansion program is very much appreciated. —2 Cor. 9:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> During the early part of this service year, a committee of brothers in each circuit made a survey of congregations having the most pressing need for new Kingdom Halls. Based on these surveys, arrangements have been made to assist some of these congregations located in California, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, New York, North Carolina and Wisconsin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> However, it is quite apparent that hundreds of other congregations are also in need of assistance. The Society, therefore, is in the process of sending out questionnaires to congregations in areas where, according to the surveys, the greatest needs exist. Hence, it is suggested that congregations should not write to the Society regarding loans unless a questionnaire has been received requesting detailed information, or unless an emergency situation exists.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> As contributions to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund continue to be received month by month and those congregations already assisted begin repaying their loans, it will be possible to increase gradually the number of loans made. We are most thankful to Jehovah for the great increase of “other sheep,” which makes it necessary to obtain more Kingdom Halls, and for the share we can all have in support of this program.—1 Cor. 3: 6-9; 2 Cor. 9:8-12.</span></p></li></ul>

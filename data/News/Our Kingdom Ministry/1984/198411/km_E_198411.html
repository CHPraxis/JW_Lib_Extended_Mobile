</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Millions of people today are concerned about survival, and with good reason. Food shortages, pollution, violence and many other lifethreatening conditions have caused men to be fearful of what the future holds. And yet, most people who are concerned about survival know little or nothing about an even greater danger. Jesus called it a “tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning.” (Matt. 24:21) Could there be a more urgent question facing humankind than that of SURVIVAL?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> What could be more timely in answering that most urgent question than our new book, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Survival Into a New Earth?</span><span class="font10"> After announcing its release at the “Kingdom Increase” District Conventions this past summer, the speaker said: “Survival has become a major concern in our times. But what confronts mankind is far more awesome than a nuclear war. It is an accounting with the Creator himself. Astounding Bible prophecies show clearly that there will be survivors. ... This book has been published to help you to be among them.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HELP FILL AN URGENT NEED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> But more than publishing a book</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OUTSTANDING NEW PUBLISHER PEAK FOR AUGUST—690,830!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">What striking evidence of Jehovah’s goodness! Surely, this is another Indication of Jehovah’s favor in answering our prayers. Like the psalmist David, we say: “I will exalt you, 0 my God the King, and I will bless your name to time indefinite, even forever.&quot; (Ps. 145:1) The total of 690,830 publishers exceeds the July peak by 20,435. The 29,764 regular pioneers for August is a new peak. Truly, the 1984 service year has been an outstanding year of increase In many respects! May it be our determination to continue sowing bountifully, confident in the promise that we will reap bountifully.—2 Cor. 9:6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Help New Ones to Share in Kingdom Increase</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> At this time of Kingdom increase we rejoice to see many new ones responding to the good news. As their knowledge and appreciation grow, they start attending meetings and soon want to share what they are learning with others as regular Kingdom publishers. This presents a challenge and an additional responsibility for those of us who already are experienced in field service. New ones need to be encouraged and trained to become effective in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In the United States during the first nine months of the 1984 service year 22,187 were baptized and a total of 10,625 more were added at the 117 “Kingdom Increase” District Conventions held during June, July and August. Are all these new ones being given personal assistance to help them become effective ministers?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TRAIN THEM FOR FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Helping new ones to become effective in the ministry is a matter of on survival is involved in filling the most urgent need of people. They must hear about it, obtain it, read and understand it, and then act on the vital information it contains. It was with this in mind that the convention speaker said: “The situation calls for urgent action on the part of all who are to survive.... This is a publication that is designed for our use in the field ministry, as well as for our own study.” Yes, brothers, ‘how will they hear without someone to preach?’ —Rom. 10:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Can you imagine anything more thrilling, more satisfying, than saving a life? But what if you could save your own life while rescuing another person? This would be even more rewarding.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> How many lives will be saved as a result of people learning the truth with the aid of this new book? The answer depends to a great extent on the effort we put forth in distributing it and the effectiveness of our presentations. We are featuring it as our literature offer during November for a contribution of $1. The effort that is put forth in sharing this new book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col.</span><span class="font10"> 1) serious concern. So build on their initial enthusiasm and zeal and help them to become effective in the field. We do not want their initial enthusiasm and zeal to diminish, and this will not happen if we provide the training they need.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Training for the field service should start early. Encourage students to share what they have learned with relatives, neighbors, acquaintances and others they know. Let them know that only a few of those they speak to are likely to respond favorably to the good news. (Matt. 7: 13, 14) But at the same time, help them to appreciate the joy that comes to the invisible as well as visible parts of God’s organization when even one person listens.—Luke 15:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>

Rehearse the presentations you will use, if working with the magazines; or help him to make a meaningful contribution in a discussion of the regular literature offer. At first, he may wish simply to read one of the scriptures or make a brief comment during the discussion. But, little by little, as you give encouragement and training, he will gain confidence and learn to handle calls on his own. first two paragraphs, one father mentions a situation with children that requires special help from parents, such as flag ceremony at school (or some other current problem in your area). Invites audience to watch as he demonstrates how he assisted his grade-school children to cope with this matter.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Even after a new one has become regular in service, he still needs your help. Continue to manifest genuine interest in his spiritual progress. That progress includes developing the ability to teach others while he himself is still learning. Be generous and sincere in commending him for his progress. Let him see that you personally have experienced much joy in helping him make spiritual advancement. —1 Tim. 4:15, 16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HELP OTHERS ALSO</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">15 min: Youths—Do Not Be Deceived. Talk and demonstration. As pointed out at “Kingdom Increase&quot; District Conventions, young ones are special target of Satan. He picks on less experienced, seducing them as he did Eve. Deceives youth by enticements, allurements, temptations. Promotes idea youth are missing out on something. Cultivates selfish desire to ‘do own thing,’ decide for self what is good, bad. We must beware of his “crafty acts.” (Eph. 6:11, fnt) He makes ways of world, such as sexual immorality, smoking, drug abuse, association with nonbelievers and worldly entertainment, look attractive. Makes such appear harmless, as fruit on tree appeared to Eve. Jehovah makes provisions to protect youths from being deceived: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Great Teacher</span><span class="font10"> books, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">School brochure, Awake!</span><span class="font10"> feature “Young People Ask,” meetings, assemblies, parents and elders. At this point introduce scene where teenage boy wanting to discuss a problem approaches an elder. His father will not let him participate in organized sports in school. He wants to know if it is really all that bad. Elder, in kind and understanding way, suggests that they speak to the father and set a time when they can review the information in chapter 16 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font10"> book. He shows boy the chapter and suggests he read it over beforehand. All agree. Conclude with comments on how much elders, parents and organization love our faithful young ministers. Our interest is in protecting them from Satan’s designs. (2 Cor. 11:3) Encourage youth and parents to use and be guided by the counsel from the discreet slave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Song 221 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">cient personal assistance so as to become effective teachers. Because of a lack of training, they may be missing much of the joy that comes from sharing the good news with others. Be alert to help them, too, especially those of you who are elders, pioneers or others who have more experience in the field.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Let us make the most of Kingdom increase by working not just to augment the number of publishers but also to develop their effectiveness in making more disciples. This is Jehovah’s way of ‘speeding up’ the gathering for salvation.—Isa. 60:22.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As you look around the Kingdom Hall, take special note of the young brothers and sisters who make such a fine contribution to the spirit of the congregation. Are we not grateful that they have remembered their Grand Creator in the days of their youth? (Eccl. 12:1) Likely such exemplary young men and women are the result of much training and effort, and we need only to inquire of their parents to confirm this. What, though, is involved in training up a boy or a girl in the right way?—Prov. 22:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Of course, each family head should arrange for a regular family study that includes the children. This is part of providing in a spiritual way for ‘those who are our own? (1 Tim. 5:8) Effort should be made to involve even the very young ones with an occasional simple question on a point they can grasp. A parent may report up to one hour each week when studying with his or her undedicated children. (See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">om</span><span class="font10"> p.104 par. 1.) But obviously more is needed to “train up” our children than a weekly Bible study. There is the day-by-day inculcating of Bible principles and the building of appreciation for Jehovah and his Son. This requires much time and effort on the part of both God-fearing parents. Though this time is not reported as field service, it surely counts toward gaining God’s approval and everlasting life.—Deut. 6: 6, 7; Eph. 6:4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PROVIDING SPECIAL HELP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Although it is necessary to teach our children the “primary doctrine,” there are times when children need specialized help due to circumstances that arise in their lives. (Compare Hebrews 6:1, 2.) When difficult situations, problems and tests confront them in school, in the neighborhood or even in the congregation, parents must give their children spiritual direction and training in addition to the family Bible study. At times the study itself can be tailored to fit a particular along with quotations on page 29 indicating how historians view that year, would appeal to persons concerned about survival. Anticipation for what is required to get the “mark” needed for survival could be raised by discussing the picture on page 95. —Compare Ezekiel 9:4, 6.</span></p></li>

Titles such as “What Will Become of Planet Earth?”, “How Long Will the Present System Last?”, “Act Wisely in the Face of Calamity” and “The Countdown Nears Its Zero Hour!” are among the interest-catching subjects dealt with in the book. Try putting the book into the householder’s hands and ask him which chapter titles interest problem at hand. For example, what if a young child is experiencing pressure to engage in the flag-salute ceremony at school? There is excellent material parents can use in chapter 34 of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Listening to the Great Teacher,</span><span class="font10"> as well as story 77 in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories </span><span class="font10">or the information on pages 12-16 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font10"> brochure.

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Question Box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">• How can we give attention to Kingdom Hall security?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In view of these critical times we need to use sound judgment in regard to Kingdom Hall security. Just as we take precautions in seeing that our homes are safe and secure, we should likewise do with our Kingdom Halls. It is the responsibility of the elders to see that each Kingdom Hal) has adequate security. This need is evident as we see more vandalism and theft being reported at halls in various places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Basic to good security would be the careful closing and locking of all doors, gates and windows after each use of the Kingdom Hall. Responsible, reliable brothers should be in charge of such security arrangements </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">each</span><span class="font10"> time the hall is used. This should include times when the hall is used for some purpose other than regular congregation meetings, such as a wedding or when cleaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If a Kingdom Hall has a parking area, it is suggested that such be well lighted at appropriate times. This will reduce vandalism to automobiles and possible injury or harm to brothers and sisters when leaving the hall. Some congregations have found it advisable to have brothers alternating as attendants outside the hall during meetings in order to check on parked cars to prevent theft and vandalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some congregations find it necessary to lock doors during meetings. In those extreme cases where this is deemed necessary, reliable attendants should be at the door at all times to monitor those entering the hall. The body of elders should determine what measures are appropriate in accord with local laws governing public meeting places. If such an arrangement is instituted, the congregation should be made aware of this beforehand so they will know the Kingdom Hall entrance will be kept locked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We want the brothers and newly interested ones to feel secure when attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall and we want to protect the property from vandalism and theft. So the elders in each congregation should consider the circumstances that prevail locally and then act in harmony with such in order to protect property and help to ensure the safety of those at the meetings.</span></p>

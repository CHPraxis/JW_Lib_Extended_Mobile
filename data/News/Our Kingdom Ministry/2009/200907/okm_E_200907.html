<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Can You Expand Your Service?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Observing the interest that multitudes showed in the Kingdom good news, Jesus instructed his disciples to &quot;beg the Master of the harvest to send out w’orkers into his harvest.&quot; (Matt. 9:37, 38) Since we are in the final hours of the harvest season, our work is even more urgent than ever before.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. What urgency exists in the field ministry, and why?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">For United States of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This means that we should prayerfully consider how we can have a fuller share in the field ministry.—John 14:13, 14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Expanded Service: </span><span class="font4">With Jehovah's guidance and help, many have found it possible to take up pioneer service. (Ps. 26: 2, 3; Phil. 4:6) Some made a special effort to serve as auxiliary pioneers one or more months during the year. This proved to be a fine way to expand their ministry. The happiness derived from engaging in this privilege caused many of them to consider becoming regular pioneers.—Acts 20:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Can You Resume Pioneer Service?: </span><span class="font4">If you previously served as a pioneer, you no doubt hold cherished memories of that time. Have you given prayerful thought to the possibility of returning to the pioneer ranks? The circumstances that caused you to come off the pioneer list may no longer be a hindrance. The time may have come for you to enjoy that special privilege once more.—1 John 5:14, 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> The harvest work is well under way and is soon to be finished. (John 4:35, 36) May all of us examine our present situation to determine whether we can adjust our affairs so as to expand our participation in the field. Or if we sincerely find that we cannot expand our service, can w<sup>r</sup>e look for ways to become more effective? (Mark 12:41-44) What a privilege is now set before all those whose present circumstances allow them to be used by Jehovah in this unique endeavor!—Ps. 110:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">2. How have some responded to the call for more workers in the field?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. If you have pioneered before, what may you now wish to consider?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10">4. What unique opportunity is open to all of us?</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>A Circuit Assembly to Help Us Safeguard Our Spirituality</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">‘Jehovah generously provides the information, training, and encouragement we need to share in the divine commission to spread the good news. (Matt. 24:14; 2 Tim. 4:17) Our annual circuit assembly is one</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1. What is one provision from Jehovah to help us fulfill our commission to spread the good news?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">such provision. A new program for the 2010 service year will develop the theme &quot;Safeguard Your Spirituality,&quot; based on Romans 8:5 and Jude 17-19. it is scheduled to begin the week of August 31, 2009.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> How Beneficial: </span><span class="font4">The program will alert us to dangers, such as distractions that threaten to consume our lime and divert our attention from what is truly important. We will learn how to counteract the spirit of permissiveness, and we will consider what characterizes a spiritual person. The Sunday symposium will show how individuals and family groups can take steps to strengthen their spirituality in the face of increasing pressures and serious tests of faith. The program will help us to safeguard our hearts, maintain our spiritual health, and keep clearly in mind the grand blessings that await those who safeguard their spirituality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ As soon as you learn when and where your next circuit assembly will he held, make plans to be present and attentive for all sessions both days. Be assured, Jehovah blesses the hands of the diligent one. -Prov. 21:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Indeed, Jehovah is the Provider of this good gift. The program prepared by the faithful slave class will be Just what we need to carry on as Christian ministers. We are grateful to Jehovah for all his loving provisions helping us to &quot;hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering. Heb. 10:23-25; Jas. 1:17.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> King David expressed his determination to praise Jehovah &quot;all day long,&quot; even to time indefinite. (Ps. 145:2, 7, 21) We too have good reason to praise Jehovah each day.-Ps. 37:10; 145:14, 18; 2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> In Our Home: </span><span class="font4">We have upbuilding printed material for meaningful spiritual discussions when considering the daily text, when enjoying Family Worship, and when preparing for congregation meetings. Many families make a practice of being together for at least one meal each day. That allows for unhurried, relaxed conversation</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. What are God's servants motivated to do, and why?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. How may families praise Jehovah each day? </span><span class="font4">and offers opportunities to praise Jehovah. Such informal discussions initiated by parents can be an important aid in bringing up their children in &quot;the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.&quot;—Eph. 6:4; Deut. 6:5-7.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> With Our Brothers: </span><span class="font4">When in field service or at congregation meetings, we have excellent opportunities to praise Jehovah alongside fellow believers. (Prov. 15:30; Phil. 4:8; Heb. 13:15) Since we hold our love for Jehovah in common, it should be easy to include sincere expressions of appreciation for Jehovah’s goodness when talking with one another.—Ps. 106:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">•* When Speaking to Unbelievers: </span><span class="font4">Although circumstances may not allow us to share in the public ministry each day, speaking even briefly to workmates, schoolmates, and others around us about Jehovah and his purposes can instill hope in hon-esthearted people. (Ps. 27:14; 1 Pct. 3:15) While traveling on an airplane, a sister was able to witness to a fellow passenger who felt so comforted and encouraged by what she heard that she gave the sister her address and phone number so that they could keep in contact with each other. As the world suffers from deepening trouble and worsening conditions, Jehovah's people continue to bring to those with listening ears &quot;good news of something better.&quot; This offers others hope and causes them to praise Jehovah.—Isa. 52:7; Rom. 15:11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> How it must please Jehovah to hear his servants praising him each day! As with Jehovah's visible creation that surrounds us, we too can bubble forth his praises each day in our homes, in the congregation, and when speaking with others who as yet have not become fellow praisers of Jehovah.—Ps. 19:1-4.</span></p></li></ul>

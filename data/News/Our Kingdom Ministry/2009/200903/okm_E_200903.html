<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Be Thoroughly Prepared for the Memorial</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">What a joy and a privilege it is for followers of the Christ to prepare thoroughly for the night when we commemorate the death of Jesus Christ! (Luke 22:19) What practical steps should be taken to prepare for the Memorial? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Time and Location: </span><span class="font7">Everyone should clearly understand the hour and the exact location that the Memorial will be held. If more than one congregation will be meeting at the Kingdom Hall, it is important to arrive on time and depart in an orderly fashion, since the time allotted between meetings is limited. Efforts should be made to avoid unnecessary congestion in the entryway, in the lobby, on the public sidewalks, and in the parking lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Invitations: </span><span class="font7">Do all the publishers have their supply of invitations, and are they familiar with the contents? Have you rehearsed how you will present this invitation? To whom will you give an invitation? Efforts should be made so that all invitations are placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Transportation: </span><span class="font7">Some interested ones as well as a number of brothers and sisters may need transportation or other personal assistance. What arrangements have been made to care for their needs?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Emblems: </span><span class="font7">Make sure that the emblems will not be passed until after sundown. Arrangements should be made to serve any of the anointed who are infirm and unable to be present. The appropriate type of bread and wine should be obtained and made ready. —See the February 15, 2003, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font7">pages 14-15, paragraphs 14, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Kingdom Hall: </span><span class="font7">The hall should be thoroughly cleaned ahead of time. Plates, wine cups or wineglasses, and a suitable table and tablecloth should be brought to the hall and put in place in advance. If another meeting place is used, ensure that there will be a suitable sound system so that all in attendance will be able to hear the speaker. Attendants and servers should be selected and instructed in advance about their duties, the proper procedure to be followed, and the need for dignified dress and grooming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On this most important occasion, the Memorial of the death of Jesus Christ, we want to be thoroughly prepared individually and as a congregation. Certainly, Jehovah's rich blessing will be upon all who demonstrate heartfelt appreciation for all that Jehovah has provided for mankind through the sacrifice of his beloved Son, Jesus Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> How thrilled we were at our &quot;Guided by God's Spirit&quot; District Convention to receive the new book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Keep Yourselves in God's Love&quot;! </span><span class="font7">As announced, this publication is designed to help us know and love Jehovah's standards of conduct and not for teaching basic Bible doctrines. We will not be offering this book from door to door.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. What is the purpose of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“God's Love&quot;</span><span class="font3"> book?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> This book will serve as the second publication to be studied with Bible students after completing the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font7"> book. Keep in mind that people have different rates of spiritual growth. Each study should be conducted at a pace comfortable to the student. Make sure that the material considered is clearly understood. In most cases, this book should not be used to start Bible studies with people who may have already studied several books in the past but who are not attending congregation meetings and clearly are not interested in conforming their lives to the Bible truths they were taught.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">* If you are presently conducting a study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Worship God</span><span class="font7"> book and are in the last few chapters, you may decide to complete that publication and to encourage the student to read the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;God's Love&quot;</span><span class="font7"> book on his own. Otherwise, it would be best to transfer to the new book and start from the beginning. As with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font7"> book, discussion of the topics in the appendix is optional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">•* If a student gets baptized before completing both books, then the study should continue until the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;God's Love&quot;</span><span class="font7"> book is finished. Even though the student is baptized, you may report the time, the return visit, and the study. A publisher who accompanies you and participates in the study may also count the time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> If you are assigned by a member of the Congregation Service Committee to conduct a Bible study with someone who has become inactive in the preaching work, you may be asked to consider specific chapters in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;God's Love&quot;</span><span class="font7"> book. Such studies need not be conducted for a prolonged period of time. What a fine provision we have in this new book, which has been designed to help us remain &quot;in God's love&quot;!—Jude 21.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">2. How will this publication be used, and with whom? 3. What should we do if we are currently conducting a study in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Worship God</span><span class="font3"> book?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. What should we do if our student gets baptized before completing the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;God's Love&quot;</span><span class="font3"> books? 5. How may the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;God's Love&quot;</span><span class="font3"> book be used to assist publishers who have not shared in the ministry for some time?</span></p>

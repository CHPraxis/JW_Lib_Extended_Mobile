<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>How Will You Answer?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> To this day, humans marvel at the effective manner in which Jesus handled inquiries and requests. When faced with various types of questions while in our ministry, we do w<sup>T</sup>ell to imitate Jesus in this regard.—1 Pet. 2:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Listen First: </span><span class="font8">Jesus considered the viewpoint of the questioner. At times this requires asking questions to ascertain what the person really means. Someone who asks, &quot;Do you be-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Ty should wt look to Jesus' example when asked a question?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">2 &nbsp;&nbsp;.&quot;-jt may help us to provide an effective answer to a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">United States of America </span><span class="font8">lieve in Jesus?&quot; may really w’onder why you do not celebrate Christmas. If you discern the questioner's real concern, you can reason with him more effectively.—Luke 10:25-37.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Respond With God's Word: </span><span class="font8">It is usually best to show how the Bible answers the question. (2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Heb. 4:12) The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font8"> book and &quot;Bible Topics for Discussion&quot; in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font8"> have proved to be helpful in giving just the right answer. Even if the questioner does not accept the Bible as an authority, you may be able to share tactfully what the Scriptures teach. Encourage the person to give serious consideration to the time-tested wisdom found in the Bible. By your imitating Jesus, your answers will be &quot;as apples of gold in silver carvings&quot;—dignified, beautiful, and valuable.—Prov. 25:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Should We Answer Every Question? </span><span class="font8">If you do not know the answer to a question, do not feel embarrassed to say: &quot;I don't know, but 1 can do research on your question and come back w<sup>T</sup>ith the results of my research.&quot; Such modesty and personal interest may move the householder to invite you to return. If you discern that a question comes from opposers who may be trying to start an argument, imitate Jesus by limiting your response. (Luke 20: 1-8) Similarly, if someone with no genuine interest in the truth tries to engage you in debate, politely discontinue the conversation and use your time searching for those who are sincere.—Matt. 7:6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Jesus knew that reliance on Jehovah was vital to fulfilling his assignment to &quot;bear witness to the truth,&quot; which included answering sincerely motivated questions. (John 18:37) What a privilege we have to imitate Jesus in giving an answer to those who are &quot;rightly disposed for everlasting life&quot;!—Acts 13:48.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Skillfully Use the Bible</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Skillful use of God's inspired Word enables us to proclaim and teach the truth clearly and expose the false teachings and traditions of men.—2 Tim. 2:15; 1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase Your Familiarity: </span><span class="font8">As with using any tool, skill comes with increased familiarity. Reading the Bible from cover to</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">1. Why is the Bible so useful?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2. What will help us locate scriptures with greater skill?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">cover gives you an overall picture of the Bible’s theme. This also helps you to remember scriptures and to find them more easily. As your familiarity with the Scriptures increases, you will speak with greater zeal and conviction when witnessing to others informally and in the field ministry. -1 Thess. 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ Make it a practice to open your Bible and follow along during congregation meetings. When engaging in personal study and in preparation for congregation meetings, look up the cited Scriptural texts and meditate on their application. Many find that reading Bible texts directly from the Bible rather than from a computer monitor or printout makes it easier to locate them later when needed in the ministry.—John 14:26.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Some families have arranged for a time to memorize Bible texts. This may be done by using flash cards that have the scripture citation on one side and the text itself on the other side. They take turns using these to see if they can quote the scripture or recall where it is located. Practicing field presentations and answering an objection or a question using the Bible also increases our skill.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> No other book can measure up to the Bible. It contains the only writings that are able to make people &quot;wise for salvation.” (2 Tim. 3:15) Since most people in our territory are not familiar with the precious treasures found in the Bible, we have good reason to increase our skill at showing them what the Bible truly has to offer. —Prov. 2:1-5.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> In addition to your house-to-house territory, could you also preach to people found at transportation hubs, parks, employment offices, busy street corners, business places, and shopping centers in your territory? Perhaps you could witness to those in gated communities and restricted apartments by means of letters or the telephone. Being observant and adaptable to changing needs in your territory will allow you to have &quot;plenty to do in the work of the Lord.&quot;—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> All of us must keep in mind that &quot;the field is the world.&quot; (Matt. 9:37; 13:38) In view of the nearness of the end of this wicked system of things, each one must seriously consider his own situation, talents, opportunities, and possibilities for expanding his ministry. Jehovah gives us the assurance that if we put Kingdom interests first, he will bless our genuine efforts to expand our ministry.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li></ul>

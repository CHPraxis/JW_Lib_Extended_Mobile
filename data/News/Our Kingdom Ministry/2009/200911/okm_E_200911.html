<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Return on Interested Ones</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—When?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Making disciples involves calling back on anyone who indicates a willingness to learn of Jehovah's Kingdom arrangement. (Matt, 28:19, 20) The best time to make a return visit often depends on our schedule as well as that of the interested one. Why should we return shortly after our initial visit?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1. What is involved in making disciples?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">For United States of America</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Why Return Soon? </span><span class="font8">The work of preaching &quot;this good news of the kingdom&quot; is far advanced, and the end of this system of things has drawn close. (Matt. 24:14; 1 Pet. 4:7) Therefore, while &quot;a day of salvation&quot; is still available to interested ones, we must heed the admonition to 'preach the word urgently,' which includes returning as soon as possible to cultivate interest shown.—2 Cor. 6:1, 2; 2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Satan is eager to take away any Kingdom seed that we might sow in an interested person's heart. (Mark 4:14, 15) Family members, workmates, and others often ridicule those who have shown interest. Returning quickly enables us to build on our earlier discussion before others succeed in putting out the spark of interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Make an Appointment: </span><span class="font8">It is best to make definite arrangements to return before you leave the initial call. Raise a question that you will answer on the next visit. Good personal record keeping in this regard is necessary. If your schedule allows, you might ask to return the next day or shortly thereafter. If the initial call is on the weekend and the interested person is working during the week, perhaps he will agree to another visit the following weekend. When you make an appointment, be sure to keep your word.—Matt. 5:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> We have good reasons to return on interested ones as soon as possible. Therefore, make an appointment and return soon, for &quot;the time left is reduced.&quot; (1 Cor. 7:29) The sooner we revisit those interested in the Kingdom message, the more productive our efforts are likely to be.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>&quot;Be Aglow With the Spirit&quot;</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> No aspect of our Christian service should become stagnant. Rather, we are encouraged to &quot;be aglow with the spirit&quot; and to &quot;slave for Jehovah.&quot; (Rom. 12:11) However, there are many things that can diminish our zeal for our ministry. How can we &quot;stir up like a fire” our zeal and enthusiasm for our Kingdom service?^ Tim. 1:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Personal Bible Study: </span><span class="font8">An effective King-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. What characteristic should mark our preaching?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2. What relationship does personal Bible study have with a zealous ministry? dom preacher is one who loves God's law and is deeply touched by the truths found therein. (Ps. 119:97) When Bible treasures are found during personal study, this stirs our hearts and intensifies our zeal. Love for the Provider of such truths and our desire to share good new’s with others moves us to offer praise to God and publicly declare his name. (Heb. 13:15) Clearly, presenting the good news in earnest reflects our deep appreciation for its value.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Pray for God's Spirit: </span><span class="font8">An effective ministry is not accomplished in our own strength. Genuine zeal comes from a free flow of God's spirit. (1 Pet. 4:11) Drawing closer to the Source of &quot;dynamic energy” will give us the spiritual fortitude to witness boldly. (Isa. 40: 26, 29-31) When the apostle Paul faced adversity in his ministry, he &quot;obtained the help that is from God.” (Acts 26:21, 22) Jehovah’s invigorating holy spirit can help us to be aglow in our ministry, so we should pray for it.-Luke 11:9-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Fiery zeal for Kingdom preaching often generates greater zeal among fellow Christians. (2 Cor. 9:2) In the territory, individuals are more likely to respond to a message that is presented with enthusiasm and conviction. Zeal, however, must always be accompanied by tact and mildness. (Titus 3:2) At all times, we seek to dignify the householder and respect his freedom of choice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> As Kingdom proclaimed, may we always &quot;be aglow with the spirit.&quot; Let us cultivate zeal through personal Bible study and fervent prayer to Jehovah, the one who can supply us with dynamic holy spirit. In this way, we can zealously carry out our ministry &quot;with holy spirit and strong conviction.&quot;—1 Thess. 1:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">3. How can God’s spirit influence our ministry? 4. Zeal can generate what fine results, yet what cautions arc in order?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">5. What inspired admonition should we endeavor to apply?</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Developing the Foreign-Language Field</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jesus Christ foretold that the good news would be preached throughout the earth &quot;for a witness to all the nations.” Those words ring clear in the ears of every minister who shares in the preaching and teaching work. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) As we go about preaching and making disciples, wc may find people of different nationalities who speak a language other than ours. These too deserve an opportu-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1. What opportunity has arisen as we share in the preaching work in our assigned territories?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">krr&gt;09</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> ll-E Us </span><span class="font8">nity to hear the Kingdom message and take a firm stand for the truth before the fear-inspiring day of Jehovah arrives. (Mal. 3:18) How can we develop the foreign-language field in our assigned territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Reflect Jehovah's View of Those Who Speak Another Language: </span><span class="font8">To reflect Jehovah's love impartially with everyone in our territory, we must have an intense desire to help people come to an accurate knowledge of the true God, Jehovah, regardless of the language they may speak. (Ps. 83:18; Acts 10:34, 35) Although we focus primarily on those who speak the language of the congregation we are associated with, we must be mindful of and attentive to the needs of those who speak another language and look for ways to share God's Kingdom message with them. To overlook those who speak another language would not be in harmony with Jehovah's purpose to give a witness to people of all the nations. How, then, may we help people who do not speak our language?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Use </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Good News for People of All Nations:</span><span class="font8"> This booklet has been designed to be used when we encounter those who speak a language different from ours. Have this booklet with you at all times, get familiar with its different features, and be prepared to use it. For quick reference, mark the different languages encountered in your territory. If literature is available in these languages, it may be practical to obtain a few' items for placement with the person after using the message in the booklet.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

Turn to the world map on the inside cover, point to yourself and the country where you live, and indicate that you would like to know where the householder is from and what language he speaks. After you have determined his language, consult the table of contents, find the appropriate page, direct the householder's attention to the sentence in bold type at the top of the page, and then indicate that you would like the householder to read the message. When he is finished, offer a tract in his language or point to the sentence highlighted in gray, which mentions that you are willing to return with a publication in the householder's own language. Then point to the expression &quot;my name” in bold type, and state your name clearly. Point to &quot;your name&quot; in bold type, and await the householder's response. Make definite arrangements for a return visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Follow-Up Arrangements: </span><span class="font8">Every effort must be made to visit those showing interest in the Kingdom message, regardless of their language. Once we have established that there is interest in God and his Word, the Bible, we should fill out a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Please Follow Up</span><span class="font8"> (S-43) form and promptly give it to the congregation secretary for submittal to the branch office so that this interested person can receive a visit from someone who speaks his language. In turn, the branch office will forward the form to the appropriate language group. When it is received, the person will be contacted without delay. The secretary may provide a copy of the form to the service overseer so that he may be kept abreast of the interest being shown by</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">5. What follow-up is necessary to care properly for those of another language who show interest?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">a particular language group. This form should be used only w’hen the individual shows true interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> From the time the S-43 form has been submitted until the interested person is called on by a designated publisher who speaks his language, some time may pass. Therefore, in an effort to develop the interest shown, the publisher who submitted the S-43 form may continue to cultivate the interest until the person is contacted by someone who speaks his language. In some cases, a Bible study may be conducted with the interested person. However, during this transition period, how may a publisher obtain literature in the language of the person showing interest?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Literature for Other Languages: </span><span class="font8">Congregations should not carry a large stock of literature in other languages. However, if it is determined by the service overseer that there is interest developing in a particular language group, he may find it appropriate to stock a modest amount of literature in that language for use by the publishers. If there is no literature available at the congregation, it may be ordered. It may take some time for literature in a particular language to arrive. Therefore, a provision is available for making printouts of literature from www.watchtower.org. There are many publications featured in hundreds of languages that can immediately be accessed by the publisher or by the interested person. No doubt this provision will prove to be useful when cultivating the interest shown by those who speak a different language.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">6. If we meet an interested person who speaks another language, what responsibility do we have?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">7. What provision is there for obtaining literature in the language of those we may meet?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Role of the Congregation: </span><span class="font8">In some cases in which a sizable foreign-language community is developing, there may be no nearby congregation conducting meetings in that language. Therefore, interested ones who speak another language should be invited to attend your meetings. The warm reception and personal interest shown to them may encourage them to associate regularly. At first, there may be a language and cultural barrier; however, there are no barriers for true Christian love in the worldwide association of Jehovah's Witnesses. (Zeph. 3:9; John 13:35) Do you speak another language fluently? If you do and are willing to follow up on calls in that language, please inform your congregation secretary so that this information can be conveyed to the branch office. This will be helpful when the branch office is looking for a publisher to cultivate the interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Language Instruction: </span><span class="font8">When you are assisting those who speak another language, it is best to encourage them to begin attending a congregation in their own language if it is reasonably possible for them to do so. However, when that is not possible, some publishers may decide to learn the other language and thus be able to give better assistance to the interested ones. If there is no nearby congregation, the branch office may determine that because of the sizable immigrant or indigenous community, a language class is warranted. Should this be the case, the branch office may inform nearby congregations of the existing need and arrange for an announcement concerning a language class. Those applying to attend the</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">language course should have the goal of switching over to the group or congregation to assist with developing that language field.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Forming a Group: </span><span class="font8">In order for a group in a particular language to be formed, four basic requirements must be met. (1) There should be sufficient interest and potential for growth in a particular language field. (2) A small core group of publishers should know the language or be learning the language. (3) A qualified elder or ministerial servant should be available to take the lead and conduct at least one weekly meeting in that language. (4) A body of elders should be willing to sponsor the group. When these requirements are met to a reasonable degree, then the body of elders will write the branch office about the particulars of the group and will request formal recognition as a congregation sponsoring a foreign-language group. (See </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Organized,</span><span class="font8"> pp. 106107.) The elder or ministerial servant taking the lead would be considered the &quot;group overseer&quot; or &quot;group servant&quot; responsible for taking care of the group.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>11</sup> Developing the foreign-language field within our assigned territory is a vital part of the worldwide preaching campaign that our Exemplar, Jesus Christ, put into effect. May we zealously do our part and see how' Jehovah continues to rock the nations and bring in those desirable to him. (Hag. 2:7) How satisfying it is for us to cooperate fully in this endeavor! May Jehovah bless our united efforts to develop the foreign-language field in our respective territories as we always remember that regardless of human language barriers, God can make it growl—1 Cor. 3:6-9.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">‘Jesus had been walking for hours. He was tired and thirsty. While his disciples went to buy food, he sat down at a well outside a Samaritan city to rest. Jesus was not in Samaria to preach; he was only passing through on his way to</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1. What can we learn from the account of Jesus’ witnessing to the woman at the well?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Galilee to continue his ministry there. Nonetheless, he took the opportunity to witness to a woman who was getting water. (John 4:5-14) Why? Jesus never stopped being Jehovah's &quot;faithful and true witness.&quot; (Rev. 3:14) We imitate Jesus by being Jehovah's Witnesses all the time.—1 Pet. 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Be Prepared: </span><span class="font9">We can be prepared to witness informally by carrying literature with us. Many publishers keep tracts on hand and place them with store clerks, gas station attendants, and others whom they come in contact with throughout the day. (Eccl. 11:6) A sister who travels frequently makes sure she always has a pocket-size Bible and a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font9"> book in her purse, and she tries to start a conversation with those sitting next to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Start a Conversation: </span><span class="font9">When witnessing informally, we do not have to introduce a Scriptural subject at the outset. Jesus did not begin the conversation with the woman at the well by identifying himself as the Messiah. He simply asked her for a drink, awakening her curiosity. (John 4:7-9) One sister found that a similar approach enables her to start a conversation when she is asked if she enjoyed celebrating a holiday. Instead of replying that she did not share in the celebration because she is one of Jehovah's Witnesses, she says, &quot;I've made a personal choice not to celebrate.&quot; The curious questioner usually asks why, allowing the sister to witness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">4. Why does Matthew 28:18-20 motivate you?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">being carried out as he did. (Matt. 28:18-20) Therefore, like our Exemplar Jesus, we are Witnesses who are ready to give public declaration of our faith anytime.—Hob. 10:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTION BOX</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Why is there a need for good judgment in connection with the use of a telephone hookup for congregation meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many congregations have made it possible for individuals who at times are unable to attend congregation meetings at the Kingdom Mall because of illness or some other unavoidable circumstance to listen to the meeting at home by means of a telephone hookup. Ensuring that this loving provision is used by those who are truly in need requires good judgment and careful organization. Hence, the elders overseeing such an arrangement would want to organize and monitor its use so that &quot;all things take place decently and by arrangement.&quot;—! Cor. 14:40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Elders will see to it that priority is given to publishers in their congregation with chronic illness or infirmity or who are otherwise shut-in. A publisher temporarily ill or incapacitated, or a progressive Bible student who may be shut-in, might likewise benefit from this provision and be included in the attendance count. Where there are not enough telephone lines to accommodate those with a legitimate need, perhaps other arrangements, such as providing them with a recording of the meeting, can be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, nothing can compare to the benefits derived from being personally present at our meetings. Our direct association with our brothers results in &quot;an interchange of encouragement&quot; and helps new ones better appreciate the need to attend. When we are present at our meetings, we absorb far more from demonstrations, the elders are able to give us personal assistance, and we experience firsthand the warm love of the brotherhood. True indeed are the sentiments of one elderly sister who, after receiving a hug as she was exiting the Kingdom Hall exclaimed: &quot;You can't get this over the phone line!&quot;—Rom. 1:11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Like Anna &quot;who was never missing from the temple,&quot; today, many of our older ones are regularly on hand at Christian meetings as their health and circumstances allow. (Luke 2: 36, 37) While using the telephone hookup when necessary, they do not view it as a convenient alternative to attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall. In imitation of their fine example, may we continue to delight in putting forth the effort to be personally present at our meetings as we worship our great God, Jehovah.—Ps. 95:1-3, 6; 122:1.</span></p>

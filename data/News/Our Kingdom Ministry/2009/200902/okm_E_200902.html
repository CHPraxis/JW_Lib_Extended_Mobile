<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Special Campaign to Advertise the Memorial!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> On Thursday, April 9, 2009, worshippers of Jehovah God worldwide will gather to reflect on his greatest act of love for mankind. (Rom. 5:6-8) We keenly anticipate having</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1. What will Kingdom publishers be involved In worldwide starting March 21, 2009, and why? </span><span class="font6">millions of interested ones present with us when we commemorate Jesus' death. A special invitation to the Memorial will be distributed earth wide starting March 21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Points to Keep in Mind: </span><span class="font6">Use to the full the illustrations, the questions, and the cited scripture on the invitation. For example, you might refer to the cover picture and say: &quot;I wanted to invite you to commemorate with us Jesus' death, which will be observed on Thursday, April 9, 2009.&quot; Then refer to the title of the invitation and subsequent questions. Be sure to emphasize that the householder is welcome to invite his family and any others he chooses to bring along.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> If your congregation has a large territory, the elders may direct you to leave the invitations at not-at-homes. On the weekends, offer the magazines in addition to using the invitation. Make it your goal to invite your return visits, Bible students, relatives, schoolmates, workmates, neighbors, and other acquaintances. Last year, one sister invited 30 of her relatives, and then she periodically reminded them of the importance of the occasion. How happy she was that 25 attended, and 4 of them later accepted a Bible study!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Plan Now: </span><span class="font6">Many publishers may be able to increase their activity during March and April. If you have children or Bible students making good progress, this may be an excellent time for them to become unbaptized publishers. Now is the time to begin making arrangements to have a full share in this campaign that advertises the commemoration of the two greatest expressions of love.—John 3:16; 15:13.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul felt a personal obligation to declare the good news to others. (1 Cor. 9:16, 19, 23) Similarly, our concern for the eternal welfare of people motivates</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. What is a Kingdom preacher willing to do for others, and why?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">us to go out of our way to share the good news with them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Preach Where and When People Can Be Found: </span><span class="font6">A good fisherman casts his line or net, not where and when it is convenient for him, but where and when the fish are most likely to be found. We too, as &quot;fishers of men,&quot; may need to make some personal adjustments in order to find people in our territory and thereby enjoy more fully the privilege of gathering up &quot;fish of every kind.&quot; (Matt. 4:19; 13:47) Can we use early evening hours to contact people at their homes or the early morning hours to do street witnessing? Paul's goal was &quot;to bear thorough witness to the good news,” and he took advantage of appropriate opportunities to do so.—Acts 17:17; 20:20, 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Adapt Your Presentation to Meet the Need: </span><span class="font6">Fishermen frequently adjust their methods in order to catch a particular type of fish. How can we present the Kingdom good news in an appealing manner to people in our territory? We must tactfully introduce a subject that is of concern to people in general and then listen carefully to their expressions regarding the matter. (Jas. 1:19) We might ask a viewpoint question to draw them out. (Prov. 20:5) In this way we will be able to adapt our presentation of the good news in a way that touches their lives personally. Paul became &quot;all things to people of all sorts.&quot; (1 Cor. 9:22) Adaptability is a key to reaching the hearts of people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> What a joy it is to share with people the &quot;good news of something better&quot;! (Isa. 52:7) May we &quot;do all things for the sake of the good news&quot; in order to reach as many as possible.—1 Cor. 9:23.</span></p></li></ul>

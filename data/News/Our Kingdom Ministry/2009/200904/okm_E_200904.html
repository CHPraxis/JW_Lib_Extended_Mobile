<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Having an active share in the preaching work can strengthen us spiritually and increase our happiness. Of course, we en-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1. What benefit does the preaching work give us?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">gage in the ministry primarily to please Jehovah. However, by obeying the command to &quot;preach the word,&quot; we receive Jehovah's blessings and also benefit ourselves in other ways. (2 Tim. 4:2; Isa. 48:17, 18) Just how can preaching strengthen us and make us happy?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> We Are Strengthened and Blessed: </span><span class="font13">Preaching encourages us to focus on Kingdom blessings rather than present troubles. (2 Cor. 4:18) Explaining Bible teachings strengthens our faith in Jehovah's promises and builds our appreciation for the truth. (Isa. 65:13,14) As we help others to grow spiritually so as to be &quot;no part of the world,&quot; we strengthen our own stand of separateness from the world.—John 17: 14, 16; Rom. 12:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Participating in the ministry helps us to cultivate Christian qualities. For example, endeavoring to &quot;become all things to people of all sorts&quot; assists us to develop greater humility. (1 Cor. 9:19-23) As we talk to those who are &quot;skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd,&quot; we are inclined to learn sympathy and empathy. (Matt. 9:36) We learn endurance when we persevere despite apathy or opposition. Our joy is increased by giving of ourselves in behalf of others—Acts 20:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> What a blessing to have a ministry that gives praise to the only One deserving of our worship! The ministry strengthens us. It brings abundant blessings to those who are completely absorbed in 'bearing thorough witness to the good news.'—Acts 20:24.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Teach Those With Limited Reading Skills</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> While engaging in our ministry, we occasionally encounter the challenge of teaching the truth to people who have difficulty reading. What can we do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Respect Their Dignity: </span><span class="font12">It is a person's heart condition, not his secular education, that matters to Jehovah. (1 Sam. 16:7; Prov. 21:2) Therefore, we do not look down on those with limited reading ability. Such ones</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. What challenge may we encounter in the ministry?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11">2. How and why do we accord dignity to those with limited reading skills?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">will be more likely to accept our help when we demonstrate respect and patience. (1 Pet. 3:15) That may involve not insisting that the person read a text or a paragraph. As a person progresses in learning precious Bible truths, he may become more eager to improve his reading ability so as to experience the joy of reading God's Word &quot;in an undertone day and night.&quot;—Ps. 1:2, 3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Teaching Methods on Bible Studies: </span><span class="font12">Pictures are an excellent teaching and memory aid. You might ask the student his observation about a picture in the publication you are using. Then use specific questions to help him understand what the picture teaches. Use scriptures that teach certain points of the picture. The pictures may also be used to review the lesson. Do not cover too much material at one time. Emphasize the theme and the main points of the lesson, and avoid introducing outside material. Read the scriptures directly from the Bible, and use questions to make sure the student understands what was read. This may increase his desire to improve his reading skills so as to search for more Bible truths on his own.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Aids to Improve Reading: </span><span class="font12">People with limited reading skills or who have had little opportunity to learn to read fluently may understand and retain information very well. You might encourage such ones to use available audio recordings of our publications. Listening closely to the reader while following along in the printed copy, even repeating the words in an undertone, will help the person to improve in his reading skills. He may also find the brochure </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Apply Yourself to Reading and Writing</span><span class="font12"> to be helpful. In some areas, the elders may also arrange reading classes in the congregation. These practical suggestions may assist us in helping those with limited reading skills to understand &quot;the holy writings,&quot; which are able to make them wise for salvation.—2 Tim. 3:15.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>QUESTION BOX___________</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Is it appropriate for congregations or individuals to use the logos of legal corporations used by Jehovah's Witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A logo is a name, symbol, or trademark designed for easy and definite recognition. The Watch Tower logo is representative of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania and other corporations used by the organization. The Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses uses an open Bible in its letterhead. Other corporations used by Jehovah's Witnesses have different logos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Congregations or individuals should not use logos or names of the organization's legal entities, or variations thereof, on their Kingdom Halls, signs, letterhead, personal objects, and so forth. Such use of the organization's logos may cause confusion for public officials, publishers, and others about the legal affiliation of the congregation with the organization's legal entities. Similarly, written correspondence could be misinterpreted as being approved or sent from the world headquarters or the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Watch Tower logo, or a variation of it, should not be used in future Kingdom Hall projects even if the Kingdom Hall is owned by a Watch Tower entity. Congregations with existing Kingdom Halls that bear a logo are not required to make immediate changes to signs or designs, since such changes may involve major alterations and much time, effort, and expense. However, consideration should be given to making a change if it would be minor and would not require extensive work. Otherwise it can be made when the building or sign is scheduled for renovation.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Are You Prepared for a Spiritual Banquet?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> A banquet requires much preparation. Food items have to be obtained, tastefully prepared, and then presented. The serving of the meal needs to be organized. In addition, the place where the meal will be eaten must be made ready. Guests must also prepare, especially if they will travel some distance to get there. Though much work is involved, enjoying a delicious, nourishing meal with friends and family makes it all worthwhile. Soon Jehovah's Witnesses earth wide will come together in groups large and small to enjoy a much anticipated spiritual feast—the &quot;Keep on the Watch!&quot; District Convention. Much work has already gone into preparing the program and getting things</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. What type of preparation is involved for a banquet? </span><span class="font13">ready. We have all been invited. In order to be in attendance and gain the most benefit, we too must prepare personally. —Prov. 21:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Get the Most Benefit: </span><span class="font13">Have you finalized your plans so that you can be present at each course of this spiritual banquet? If necessary, speak with your employer to inform him that you will be attending all sessions of your convention, including the first day. Have you finalized arrangements for transportation and lodging? Elders should verify that the elderly and infirm as well as others who may need assistance have been cared for.—Jer. 23:4; Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Some areas will enjoy international</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">2. Being present for each course of our spiritual banquet requires what?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. Why should we not attend an international convention to which we were not invited? </span><span class="font13">conventions. Keep in mind that specific congregations and foreign delegates have been invited to these events. In making these arrangements, the branch office has carefully calculated how many to invite, considering the number of seats and hotel rooms available. Overcrowding may occur if publishers attend an international convention to which they have not been invited.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Prepare to arrive at the convention early enough each day to find a seat </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font13"> the program begins. Use a few minutes before the session begins to look over the printed program. This will help you to prepare your heart for the information to be presented. (Ezra 7:10) When the session chairman introduces a musical interlude, enjoy listening to it and then be ready to share in the opening song and prayer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> If family members sit together during the convention, parents will be able to make sure that their children are listening closely to the program. (Deut. 31:12) All are encouraged to follow along in their Bible as scriptures are read. Taking brief notes may help you to pay close attention. Later, your notes will help you recall the main points of the talks. Resist the temptation to talk needlessly during the session or to leave your seat. If you have a cell phone, do not allow it to distract you or others during the program. After each day's sessions, why not discuss with others what you appreciated from the program?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> At the district convention, we have the opportunity to enjoy a unique bond with our brothers and sisters that is not experienced in the world. (Ps. 133:1-3; Mark 10: 29, 30) Why not make it a point to introduce yourself to those sitting near you</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">4. What reminders will help us to be ready for the start of the program each day?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">5. How may our family get the most benefit from the program?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">6. What is an outstanding aspect of our conventions, and how may we enjoy it to the full? </span><span class="font13">and converse with them during the lunch break? This is one of the advantages of bringing a light lunch and remaining at the convention facility rather than going outside to a restaurant. Make sure not to miss out on such an opportunity for an interchange of encouragement.—Rom. 1: 11, 12.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Dress: </span><span class="font13">It is noteworthy that Jehovah commanded the Israelites to make fringed edges on the skirts of their garments, with a blue string above the fringe. (Num. 15:37-41) This was a visual reminder that they were a people set apart to worship Jehovah. Today, our dignified, modest dress worn when at the convention sets us apart from the world. It serves as a powerful witness to onlookers even when we may go out to eat after the program. Therefore, give careful advance thought to the clothing you will wear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Give a Witness: </span><span class="font13">With a little forethought, we may be able to witness to people while in the convention city. One brother who went to a restaurant with his wife after the program simply pointed to his convention badge and asked the waiter: &quot;Have you seen many people wearing these badges?&quot; The waiter said that he had noticed them and wondered what they were about. This led to a conversation, and the brother invited the waiter to the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Though our brothers will present all the talks, interviews, and demonstrations, it is our heavenly Father, Jehovah, who is the loving Provider of this yearly spiritual banquet. (Isa. 65:13, 14) We demonstrate appreciation to our Host by being present each day and savoring every morsel of spiritual food that is served. Have you finalized your preparations to do so?</span></p></li></ul>

The doors will open at 8:00 a.m. When the introductory music is announced, all of us should be at our seats so that the program can begin in a dignified manner. The program will conclude at 4:55 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and at 4:00 p.m. on Sunday. For international conventions, the program for Thursday will begin at 1:20 p.m. and conclude at 4:45 p.m.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Parking: </span><span class="font13">At all convention sites where we control the parking, the spaces will be made available to attendees at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. Only persons who have a state-approved disabled license plate or placard will be allowed to park in the area reserved for the disabled. Since parking space is usually limited, carpooling should be done to the extent possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Seat Saving: </span><span class="font13">Seats may be saved only for those traveling with you in the same vehicle or living with you in the same home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Noon Meal: </span><span class="font13">Please bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers and glass containers are not permitted in the convention facility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Donations: </span><span class="font13">We can show our appreciation for the convention arrangements by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at our Kingdom Hall or at the convention. Any checks contributed at the convention should be made payable to &quot;Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Accidents and Emergencies: </span><span class="font13">Emergency-response services receive many cell-phone calls over minor matters. If a medical emergency arises at the convention site, please contact a nearby attendant, who will immediately notify First Aid so that our qualified first-aid personnel on-site can assess the seriousness of the situation and render assistance. If it is necessary, our first-aid personnel will call 911.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Footwear: </span><span class="font13">Each year a number of injuries occur that are related to footwear. It is best to choose modest, well-fitting shoes that will allow one to walk safely on stairs, gratings, and so forth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Hearing Impaired: </span><span class="font13">The program will be broadcast in the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. To use this provision, you will need to bring a small battery-operated FM receiver with earphones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Recording: </span><span class="font13">Recording devices should not be connected to the facility's electric or sound system and may only be used in a way that does not disturb others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Baby Strollers and Lawn Chairs: </span><span class="font13">Baby strollers and lawn chairs should not be brought to the convention site. However, child-safety seats that can be secured in a seat next to the parents are acceptable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Fragrances: </span><span class="font13">Most conventions take place in enclosed areas with mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be a kindness for us to limit the use of strong fragrances, colognes, and perfumes that may cause reactions in persons with respiratory or related problems—1 Cor. 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Follow-Up Forms: </span><span class="font13">A </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Please Follow Up</span><span class="font13"> (S-43) form should be used to provide information regarding any interest from informal witnessing during the convention. Publishers should bring one or two follow-up forms to the convention. Completed forms may be submitted to the Book Room for handling or to your congregation secretary upon your return.—See the February 2005 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> p. 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Restaurants: </span><span class="font13">Honor Jehovah's name by your fine conduct at restaurants. In many places, it is customary to leave a 15 to 20 percent tip, depending on the service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Hotels: </span><span class="font13">(1) Please do not reserve more rooms than you will actually use, and do not have more people stay in your room than what is allowed. (2) If you must cancel your reservation, notify the hotel immediately. (3) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it, and return it immediately so that others may use it. (4) Do not cook in rooms where cooking is not permitted. (5) Leave a tip for the housekeeper each day. (6) Do not abuse any complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice provisions that are made available for guests to use while they are at the hotel. (7) Display the fruitage of the spirit in dealing with the hotel staff at all times. They are caring for a large number of guests and appreciate our kindness, patience, and reasonableness. (8) The room rate shown on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Recommended Lodging List</span><span class="font13"> is the full price per day, excluding tax. If you are overcharged or billed for things you did not request or use, refuse these charges and inform the Rooming Department at the convention as soon as possible. (9) If a problem arises with your hotel room, be sure to inform the Rooming Department while at the convention.</span></p></li></ul>

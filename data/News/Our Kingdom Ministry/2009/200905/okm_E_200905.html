<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Teach With Simplicity</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Simplicity is a key ingredient in effective teaching. Considering the way the Great Teacher, Jesus, taught can help us to enhance our &quot;art of teaching.&quot;—2 Tim. 4:2; John 13:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Speak With Simplicity: </span><span class="font8">The Sermon on</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. What is one important aspect of clear, effective teaching?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">2. What is involved when teaching with simplicity, and what effects does such teaching have? </span><span class="font8">the Mount contains some of the most profound truths ever spoken by man, all expressed with simplicity. (Matt., chaps. 5-7) The crowds listening to Jesus were &quot;astounded at his way of teaching.&quot; Officers sent to arrest him were moved to say: &quot;Never has another man spoken like this.&quot; (Matt. 7:28, 29; John 7:46) We do not need to use high-sounding words, complicated phrases, or detailed illustrations to make the truth thoroughly convincing to others. The truth can be clearly explained using familiar terms.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Gauge the Amount: </span><span class="font8">Jesus took into consideration his audience in determining how much information to convey to them at one time. (John 16:12) We must be observant and flexible in this regard, especially when witnessing to relatives, newly interested persons, or children. We should be careful not to overwhelm them with information even when they may appear to be listening attentively. Those who are honesthearted will continue to take in knowledge of the true God, Jehovah. -John 17:3; 1 Cor. 3:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Focus on Main Points: </span><span class="font8">Jesus did not clutter what he was teaching by including too many details. When he said: &quot;All those in the memorial tombs will... come out,&quot; it was not the time for him to elaborate regarding the two destinies of those resurrected. (John 5: 28, 29) When conducting Bible studies, we should focus on the main points and curb the tendency to bring unnecessary outside material into the discussion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> How grateful we are that Jehovah has taught with simplicity all we need to know! (Matt. 11:25) May we apply ourselves to teaching with simplicity and experience the joys of having a fruitful ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">3. Why may some tend to overwhelm their audience, and how can this be avoided?</span></p></li>
<li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The Service Meeting is designed to equip us for a productive ministry. The focus is on preaching the Kingdom good news, making disciples, and declaring the approaching execution of divine judgment. (Matt. 28:20; Mark 13:10; 2 Pet. 3:7) We benefit most from this important meeting when we are well prepared and ready to participate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Talk: </span><span class="font8">Source material for a talk is generally shown in the instructions to the speaker.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. What is the purpose of the Service Meeting, and how may we gain the most benefit from it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">2. How can we prepare to listen to a talk?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">You may review the assigned material, including the cited scriptures, and think about how you may apply the information in your ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Question-and-Answer Discussion: </span><span class="font8">This part will be handled much like the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> Study, with a brief introduction and conclusion. Underline key points in each paragraph, and be prepared to give brief meaningful comments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Audience Discussion: </span><span class="font8">This part will be presented as a talk, but the speaker will call for some audience participation. If you underline the key points and look up the cited scriptures, you may be able to comment when questions are asked. The brother handling this part will make every effort to involve the audience in covering main points.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Demonstrations: </span><span class="font8">Some parts will include realistic demonstrations to show how the information considered may be used in the local territory. Elders or experienced publishers or pioneers will be called on to help out in this way. Your preparation for this part may include anticipating how the matter will be presented. When a sample presentation is demonstrated, think about how you might personalize it and adapt it to different householders. Be sure to have with you the publication or magazine that will be used in the demonstration. During your Family Worship evening, you may find it beneficial to practice some of these presentations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> The Service Meeting is more enjoyable when we are prepared and we anticipate the fine instruction to be presented. Doing so will result in a greater interchange of encouragement. (Rom. 1:11, 12) If we take the time to prepare for the Service Meeting, we will be better equipped to fulfill our commission. —2 Tim. 3:17.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> After Jesus miraculously fed a large crowd, he arranged for the leftover food to be saved. (Matt. 14:19-21) Such appreciation for Jehovah's provisions sets a fine example for us to 'show ourselves thankful' by making good use of all that Jehovah provides through &quot;the faithful steward.&quot;—Col. 3:15; Luke 12:42; Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. How may we imitate Jesus' example of appreciation for Jehovah's provisions?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Magazines: </span><span class="font8">Magazines can easily accumulate. If we regularly have leftover magazines, we should reduce the number that we request. What about older magazines? These do not lose their value with the passage of time. If we have an accumulation of older magazines, perhaps the service overseer or another elder can assist us to find effective ways to place them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Other Literature: </span><span class="font8">When the offer changes to a different publication, first check to see if you already have field service copies of the publication at home before obtaining additional copies of the literature at the Kingdom Hall. Be mindful of getting copies only as needed for the week, and return to the counter for more after those are placed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> As for publications for personal use, request only what you actually need. Write your name in the space provided. That will help you keep track of your personal copy. If you use the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Library</span><span class="font8"> on CD-ROM and have saved your personal copies of the magazines, you may not feel a need to request personal copies of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">bound volumes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Placement of Publications: </span><span class="font8">We strive to place our publications only with those who show genuine interest. Keep in mind that we are the ones primarily responsible for the financial coverage of these valuable tools in our ministry. When leaving a publication with interested ones, do not hesitate to inform them of the privilege they have to support the worldwide work with their donation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Jesus miraculously provided physical food for others, but more often he fed people spiritually. Jesus said: &quot;Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah's mouth.&quot; (Matt. 4:4) Our publications teach Bible truths vital for gaining everlasting life. (John 17:3) They are far too valuable to waste!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Assembly Day Program for 2010</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> &quot;Make Sure of the More Important Things,&quot; &quot;Standing Firm as One Flock,&quot; &quot;Keep Bearing Witness to the Truth,&quot; and &quot;We Are the Clay—Jehovah Is Our Potter.&quot; (Phil. 1:9,10, 27; John 18:37; Isa. 64:8) These are but a few of the many themes discussed at past special assembly days. Are you eager to attend the special assembly day for the 2010 service year? It will develop the theme:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1. (a) What Scriptural special assembly day themes have been developed in recent years? (b) Are there any particular highlights from previous special assembly days that assisted you in your ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">for United States of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;The Time Left Is Reduced,&quot; taken from 1 Corinthians 7:29.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Start building enthusiasm for the special assembly day as soon as the date is announced in your congregation. Some parents help their children look forward to the assembly by putting the date on the family calendar, along with a checklist of items needed, and then they count down the days. During your Family Worship evening, you may wish to review notes from previous special assembly days. You can also prepare your heart for this event by reviewing </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education,</span><span class="font8"> pages 13-16, to help you and your family &quot;pay attention to how you listen.&quot;—Luke 8:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Apply What You Learn: </span><span class="font8">A common expression heard after an assembly is, “What a wonderful program!&quot; That is always true, as this is one of many rich provisions from Jehovah. (Prov. 10:22) For the information to bear fruit, you must meditate on it and retain it. (Luke 8:15) Take time on your way home after the assembly to discuss the program as a family or with those in your car group. Discuss one another's goals and points that will help you in your ministry. Doing so will contribute to your benefiting from the information long after the assembly.—Jas. 1:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> We always feel special when we receive a practical gift that is exactly what we need. Do we not eagerly anticipate what Jehovah has in store for us at our next special assembly day? We can be sure that it will be practical in every way. We can expect to receive from our heavenly Father, Jehovah, just the right gift by way of encouragement and training for carrying on the work he has assigned us to do.—2 Tim. 4:2; Jas. 1:17.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Whether it is your first or yet another year for enrollment, you young Christians face new challenges and pressures.

(Prov. 1:8; 6:20; 23:23-25; Eph. 6:1-4; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17) By now you no doubt know what challenges to expect in your school. With godly training and knowledge of the environment you will face, prepare yourself to give a witness. (Prov. 22:3) Give serious consideration to the instruction and helpful Scriptural suggestions found in the two volumes of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask</span><span class="font8"> as well as in related articles published regularly in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Your unique territory will allow you to give a witness in many ways. When others observe your exemplary dress and grooming, your conduct and speech, your respectfulness toward your classmates and teachers, and even your grades, and they sense that you have a solid foundation in life, some may ask, &quot;Why are you so different?&quot; (Mal. 3:18; John 15:19) An opportunity may open up for you to give a witness and explain your convictions. (1 Tim. 2:9, 10) Throughout the year, you will likely face challenges such as nationalistic ceremonies and holidays. If asked why you do not participate, will you just say, &quot;It is against my religion; I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses,” or will you take the opportunity to give a witness about your loving Father, Jehovah? Good preparation under Jehovah's direction will make you ready to give a fine witness to teachers, fellow students, and others.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Although you may be a bit apprehensive about going to school, know that you have the support of many that want you to have a successful school year. Furtherjnore, we rejoice with you in the prospects you have to witness to others in your unique territory. Therefore, be courageous and ready for school!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">Song 204</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Meet the Challenge of Witnessing to Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> As the Kingdom work continues to increase in these last days, there is an urgent need for spiritually qualified men to take the lead. (Mark 4:30-32; Acts 20:28; 1 Tim. 3:1 13) Yet, in some places fewer men than women are embracing the Kingdom message. In some cultures, men defer to their wives when it comes to spiritual matters and religious instruction for the children. How can we encourage more men to become con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1. What urgent need exists in caring for Kingdom interests?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">km09</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 08-E Us </span><span class="font8">scious of their spiritual need and join us in true worship?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Search for Men: </span><span class="font8">When a family head accepts the truth, he often influences others in the family to join him in pure worship. For example, while in prison for their preaching, Paul and Silas witnessed to a jailer. The man and his entire household were baptized. (Acts 16:25-34) As a result of Paul's preaching in Corinth, &quot;Crlspus the presiding officer of the synagogue became a believer in the Lord, and so did all his household.&quot; (Acts 18:8) Peter was used by Jehovah to witness to Cornelius, an army officer described as &quot;a devout man and one fearing God.&quot; Cornelius, together with his relatives and intimate friends, was baptized.—Acts 10:1-48.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Witnessing to men &quot;in high station&quot; may have far-reaching effects. (1 Tim. 2:1, 2) For example, Jehovah's angel advised Philip to speak to &quot;a man in power” who was over all the treasure of the queen of the Ethiopians. Philip heard the man &quot;reading aloud the prophet Isaiah&quot; and explained to him the good news about Jesus. This Ethiopian became a disciple and likely spread the good news en route to his homeland. He also may have witnessed to the queen and those in her court, persons who otherwise would have had limited opportunities to hear the good news.—Acts 8:26-39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Contact More Men: </span><span class="font8">Since men are often at their jobs during the day, could you arrange your schedule to spend more time in the ministry in the evenings, on weekends, or during holidays? Regularly working business territory will give you additional opportunities to witness to men who are seldom at home. Brothers can also make a special effort to witness informally to their male workmates. In the house-to-house ministry, especially in territory that is worked</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">2. How did the efforts of Paul and Peter to witness to men bear good results?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3. In imitation of Philip, to whom &quot;in high sta tion&quot; can you give a witness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">4. How can we give men more opportunities to hear the good news?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Kingdom Ministry, August 2009 </span><span class="font8">frequently, brothers might on occasion ask to speak with the man of the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>S</sup>A sister who receives a favorable response to the truth from a man should not call back alone. She may take along her husband or another publisher. As the interested person makes progress, it is generally best to turn the call over to a qualified brother.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Choose Topics That Interest Men: </span><span class="font8">The apostle Paul considered his audience and adapted his approach so that he could &quot;gain the most persons.” (1 Cor. 9:19-23) Likewise, we should consider what topics will likely appeal to the men we may meet and prepare accordingly. For instance, men are often concerned about economic challenges, good government, and caring for the safety and security of their family. They may also be interested in the purpose of life, the future of the earth, and why God allows suffering. Our presentation of the Kingdom message will be better received if we manifest such insight in our approach.—Prov. 16:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Reach Out to Unbelieving Husbands: </span><span class="font8">While the fine conduct of our Christian sisters often exerts the greatest influence on their unbelieving husbands, members of the congregation can also have a positive effect. (1 Pet. 3:1-4) When an unbelieving mate accompanies his wife to a meeting, the warm welcome he receives from the congregation will be a powerful witness. His presence likely indicates a measure of interest in the truth, and he may be willing to accept a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> On the other hand, some husbands show little spiritual interest initially but may eventually be willing to discuss the Bible</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">5. How should a sister handle the matter when she receives a favorable response to the Kingdom message from a man?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">6. How may we imitate the apostle Paul so as to “gain the most persons&quot;?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">7. How may ail in the congregation have a positive effect on unbelieving husbands who attend a meeting?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">8. How may brothers reach out to help unbelieving husbands who have demonstrated little interest in the truth?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">with a brother they feel comfortable with. Brothers in one congregation made a point when occasionally visiting a religiously divided family to chat with the unbelieving husband about things they knew he was interested in. This eventually led to spiritual discussions, and now he is baptized. In another case, a brother helped a friendly unbelieving husband to build a fence around his house. By demonstrating personal interest in this way, a Bible study was started. (Gal. 6:10; Phil. 2:4) If you are a Christian brother, why not reach out to one or more of these unbelieving husbands?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Train for the Future: </span><span class="font8">Men who respond to the Kingdom message and reach out for privileges in Jehovah's service may come to be among the &quot;gifts in men,&quot; Christian elders who use their abilities and strengths in behalf of the congregations of Jehovah’s people. (F.ph. 4:8; Ps. 68:18) Such men shepherd the congregation willingly and eagerly. (1 Pet. 5:2, 3) What a blessing they become to the entire association of brothers!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup> For instance, Saul became &quot;an apostle to the nations,&quot; though once a persecutor of Christians. (Rom. 11:13) The disciple Ananias was initially reluctant to preach to Saul because of this. Nevertheless, Ananias followed the Lord's direction and spoke to the man who became the apostle Paul. Over the years, Paul's ministry benefited the thousands who heard him preach as well as the millions who continue to benefit from his inspired letters recorded in God's Word. -Acts 9:3-19; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>11</sup> May we therefore make whatever adjustments are necessary to meet the challenge of witnessing to men. As we pursue this goal, we are assured of Jehovah's blessing on our diligent efforts to do his will and care well for Kingdom interests.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">9. What outcome may training of Christian men have?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">10. How did Ananias' efforts to assist Paul benefit many?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">•Jesus set the example of caring for the Kingdom-preaching work in an organized and efficient manner. Likewise today, those responsible for this worldwide Kingdom-preaching campaign are very desirous of seeing this work cared for in like manner. In harmony with this endeavor, congregations worldwide use meetings for field service as one way to organize groups of Kingdom preachers for the field service, - Matt; 24:45-47; 25:21; Luke 10:1-7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> A Fine Arrangement: </span><span class="font8">Meetings for field service are designed to provide encouragement, practical instruction, and direction for those about to go out in the field ministry. The daily text may be briefly discussed when clearly applicable to the field ministry. At times, reminders from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font8"> the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font8">book, or perhaps the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font8"> book are called to mind in order to prepare all present for the work that day. A brief demonstration regarding a publication being offered may also be presented. Before the concluding prayer, all should know with whom they will be working in the ministry and where the territory to be worked is located. Shortly after this meeting of no more than 15 minutes, all should be on their way to the territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How Are They Organized? </span><span class="font8">The service overseer, taking the lead, is responsible for the coordination of meetings for field service. Group overseers, or their assistants, are responsible for accompanying their respective field service groups on the weekends. Some overseers or ministerial servants may be able to accompany service</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">2. What is expected at meetings for field service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3. Who are responsible for the organization of meetings for field service? groups midweek. Group overseers work closely with the service overseer so as to have sufficient territory for their group to work from house to house on the weekends. During the week, the service overseer will supervise the arrangements for those who will take the groups out for field service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">'•Where and When Should These Meetings Be Held? </span><span class="font8">Rather than having the entire congregation meet in one location, it is generally best for these meetings to be held in convenient locations, usually private homes, throughout the territory with the intent of working the congregation's territory effectively. Kingdom Halls may also be used for this purpose. Many congregations use the Kingdom Hall to hold a meeting for service shortly following their Sunday public talk and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> Study. Effort should be made to minimize the amount of travel to the territory. Therefore, arrangements can be reviewed periodically to ensure that the current locations continue to be appropriate for working the territory efficiently and completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>s</sup> The best time for these meetings to be held and how many times they should be conducted throughout the week depend on the makeup of the territory. The following questions may serve as a guide to determine where and when meetings for field service can best be held.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> What territory needs further attention? What is the best time to'w'ork from house to house? Should a time in the evening be scheduled for house-to-house work or to make return visits? All field service arrangements should be placed on the congregation information board. It is the 4-6. (a) What objective do meetings for field service have in relation to the congregation territory? (b) What can be considered to determine the need for meetings for field service?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">desire of all Kingdom publishers to cover their assigned territory thoroughly to such a degree that we too may say as did the apostle Paul: &quot;I no longer have untouched territory.&quot;—Rom. 15:23.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Conducting Meetings for Field Service: </span><span class="font8">The one assigned to care for this meeting shows deep respect for this theocratic arrangement by preparing well. These meetings should start on time and should be instructive and brief, between 10 and 15 minutes. The conductor should have territory for the group to work before the meeting is started. Although it is not necessary to wait for latecomers after the meeting for field service has ended, leaving a message about where the group will be working can be helpful. All should be on their way to the assigned territory shortly after the meeting has finished. A well-organized and instructive meeting for field service will no doubt provide the necessary direction for all present to carry out their ministry that day.—Prov. 11:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Attending Meetings for Field Service: </span><span class="font8">Cooperation is essential. (Heb. 13:17) When possible, the one organizing the group will assist any who need someone to work with. It is good for experienced publishers to be present so as to be helpful in caring for newer and less experienced publishers. Those willing to be assigned to work with someone different, on occasion, may be able to accomplish much good. (Prov. 27:17; Rom. 15:1, 2) All should make a concerted effort to be punctual. Our respect for this theocratic arrangement and consideration for our fellow workers will move us to make the necessary adjustments in this regard.—2 Cor. 6:3, 4; Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Pioneer Support: </span><span class="font8">Pioneer support at meetings for field service is valuable and encouraging to all. Understandably, pioneers have many responsibilities. Aside from conducting Bible studies and making return visits, their daily schedule may include caring for family responsibilities and secular employment. Thus, pioneers should not feel required to support every meeting for field service organized by the congregation, especially if such are held each day. However, it will likely be possible for pioneers to support at least some meetings for service each week. To some degree, meetings for field service are a training ground, and the spiritual background and experience of the pioneers can be of great assistance to others. Their constant exposure to the field ministry has allowed them to gain experience in the ministry. This can be shared. Their zealous participation in the ministry and at meetings for field service has made them an example to imitate. And their participation at these meetings for service is very much appreciated.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’&quot;As was the case with Jesus and his disciples, a large part of our Kingdompreaching work is accomplished by witnessing from house to house. Meetings for field service are for the purpose of mutual encouragement and effective participation in this work. All publishers of the good news should be supporters of such theocratic arrangements to the extent possible. (Acts 5:42; 20:20) May all- of us give wholehearted support to this endeavor. By so doing, we can be sure of having Jehovah's rich blessing and can make the heart of our Leader, Jesus Christ, rejoice as we preach the good news of God's Kingdom. -Matt. 25:34-40; 28:19, 20.</span></p>

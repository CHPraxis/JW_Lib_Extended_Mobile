Jesus provided a good example for us in that he viewed those to whom he preached as sheep in need of help. (Matt. 9:36-38) Though Ananias was initially apprehensive about calling on Saul, what helped him to change his viewpoint? (Acts 9:13-15) How did his approach indicate a positive attitude on his part? (Acts 9:17) What reasons do we have for approaching people in our territory with a positive attitude? How will a positive attitude make our ministry more effective? Briefly interview one or two publishers whose positive attitude led to good results in their ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">* Limit introductory comments to less than a minute, and follow with a question-and-answer discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">How Will They Hear?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> With Jehovah's day fast approaching, there is an urgent need to assist yet countless others in obtaining an accurate knowledge of God and his purpose for mankind. (John 17:3; 2 Pet. 3:9, 10) This may be challenging at times, since many are apathetic or may ridicule us because of our preaching work. (2 Pet. 3:3, 4) Nonetheless, we have every reason to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1. Why may the preaching work be challenging, and why do we persist? </span><span class="font9">believe that there are still those in our territory who will accept the good news once they hear it. How will such ones hear without someone to preach?—Rom. 10:14, 15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Facing Opposition: </span><span class="font9">For the sake of those willing to hear the Kingdom message, we must not be deterred. Philippi was the first city in Europe to hear the apostle Paul preach the good news. When false accusations were leveled against him and Silas, both were beaten with rods and thrown into prison. (Acts 16:1624) However, that painful experience did not cause Paul to shrink back in fear. When he visited Thessalonica, the next city on his missionary tour, he 'mustered up boldness by means of God.' (1 Thess. 2:2) Does not Paul's example illustrate the reason for our 'not giving up'?—Gal. 6:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Many who have refused to listen for years have experienced a change of heart. Economic reversal, illness, a death in the family, or reports of disturbing events on the world scene may prompt such a change. (1 Cor. 7:31) Some whose parents were opposed have become adults and are willing to listen. Our continued preaching gives such ones the opportunity to 'call on the name of Jehovah' before it is too late.—Rom. 10:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> &quot;Without Letup&quot;: </span><span class="font9">Our love for God and neighbor will motivate us to continue &quot;without letup&quot; in the preaching and disciplemaking work, just as the apostles did in the first century. (Acts 5:42) Many today are &quot;sighing and groaning over all the detestable things&quot; now taking place. (Ezek. 9:4) What hope and relief such ones receive when they hear the good news! Even when most people refuse to listen, we have Scriptural assurance that Jehovah is well pleased with our efforts. -Heb. 13:15, 16.</span></p></li></ul>

Our consciences will be molded according to the lofty standards of righteousness revealed in God's Word. (Ps. 19:7, 8) As our understanding of Jehovah's way of thinking increases, our obedience in all areas of life will be motivated by a desire to please him.—Prov. 27:11; 1 John 5:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Be Determined to Participate: </span><span class="font10">As you prepare, make it your goal to praise God among his congregated people. (Heb. 13:15) The entire congregation will consider this new study publication together. The smaller portion of material will allow all of us to prepare thoroughly, giving us confidence to share what we have learned. Our well-prepared, concise comments will incite others to love and fine works and will contribute to a lively, meaningful consideration of the material. (Heb. 10:24) Also, our joy will be made full as we individually make expressions of our faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> On his final night on earth as a human, Jesus linked observing Jehovah's commandments with remaining in God's love. (John 15:10) With the assistance of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;God's Love&quot;</span><span class="font10"> book, we will be more resolved than ever to apply Bible principles in everyday life and to 'keep ourselves in God's love.'—Jude 21.</span></p></li></ul>

Each congregation should try to hold its own Memorial observance. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from some association after the Memorial.</span></p>

If there is a change at any time, the Congregation Service Committee should complete, sign, and send an S-29 form to the branch office promptly.

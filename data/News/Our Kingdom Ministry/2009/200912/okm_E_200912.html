<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Preach With Urgency!</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> &quot;Preach the word, be at it urgently.&quot; (2 Tim. 4:2) Why is Paul's exhortation so important in our day? How can these words impact our lives and those of others?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. What exhortation of Paul demands attention in our day?</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Lives Are Involved: </span><span class="font11">Millions of people around the world have yet to hear the good news that can lead to their salvation. (Rom. 10:13-15; 1 Tim. 4:16) Many honesthearted ones are being found in territory frequently worked. If we call on a different day or at another time of day, we may find a different person. Such diligent searching will leave us with a clean conscience and free of bloodguilt.—Acts 20:26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In spite of facing violent opposition, first-century Christians 'filled Jerusalem with their teaching.' (Acts 5:28) Are we equally determined to &quot;give a thorough witness&quot;? (Acts 10:42) When in the ministry, do we make wise use of time? If we are waiting as others make a return visit, do we take the initiative to speak with passersby?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Increases Our Alertness: </span><span class="font11">With the end of this system of things near at hand, we must stay alert, keeping on the watch. (1 Thess. 5:1-6) When we regularly speak about our Kingdom hope, we avoid becoming weighed down by this system of things. (Luke 21:34-36) In turn, as we keep the day of Jehovah &quot;close in mind,&quot; we are moved to increase our share in the lifesaving preaching work.—2 Pet. 3:11, 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> When we preach with urgency, we reflect Jehovah's view of life: &quot;He does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.&quot; (2 Pet. 3:9; Ezek. 33:11) May we be resolved to contact as many as possible in our territory, all to Jehovah's praise!—Ps. 109:30.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>'Impart Your Soul' to Your Students</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In order to help a Bible student to the point of dedication, more is required than simply conducting a regular Bible study with him. The apostle Paul compared his relation-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. What is required to help a Bible student? ship with those he taught to that of a nursing mother cherishing her children. We too are pleased to impart &quot;our own souls&quot; in order to help our students to grow spiritually. -1 Thess. 2:7-9.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Take a Personal Interest: </span><span class="font11">As a Bible student applies what he learns, his conscience will prompt him to discontinue close association with those who do not conform to Bible principles. (1 Pet. 4:4) His family may disown him. (Matt. 10:34-36) We can help fill the emotional void by demonstrating warm personal interest. One experienced missionary recommends: &quot;Do not rush away from the study after it is over. If appropriate, stay and talk for a while.&quot; Be alert to offer your student practical help. For example, could you telephone or visit him when he is sick? Can you sit with your student at meetings and help with the children, if fitting?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Help From the Congregation: </span><span class="font11">If you are working in the ministry' near your student's home, why not visit briefly to introduce your service companions? When appropriate, from time to time invite different publishers, including elders, to accompany you on the study. Also, soon after you establish a study, encourage your Bible student to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall. This will enable him to enjoy upbuilding association with members of the congregation who may become his spiritual family.—Mark 10: 29, 30; Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> A parent who tirelessly assists his children spiritually is overjoyed when they take a stand for Jehovah and walk in the truth. (3 John 4) We can experience similar joy as we impart our souls to help our Bible students.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">2. Why should we demonstrate personal interest, and how may that be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. How can we help our student receive encouragement from the congregation?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11">4. How may our diligence be rewarded?</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Informal witnessing can be very effective. The Bible contains numerous examples of informal witnessing with good results. (John 4: 7-15) What might we do to prepare for this type of witnessing?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Dress and Grooming: </span><span class="font11">Proper attention to our dress and grooming at all times will allow</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1. What example shows that informal witnessing can be effective?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">2. How can our dress and grooming complement our readiness to give a witness? </span><span class="font11">us to share our faith freely with others. (1 Tim. 2:9,10) If we feel uncomfortable about our appearance, we will likely hold back from giving a witness. In contrast, our neat, clean appearance may in itself arouse curiosity. For example, while traveling, a well-dressed Witness couple were seated next to a Muslim man. Noticing their appearance, the man asked if they were Christians. This led to a three-hour Bible discussion.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Starting Conversations: </span><span class="font11">When Jesus met the Samaritan woman at Jacob's fountain, he began the conversation by simply requesting that she give him a drink. Similarly, we may be able to start a conversation by making a brief statement or by asking a simple question. Although we may at times be hesitant, by depending on Jehovah's assistance, we may 'muster up boldness' to start a conversation. —1 Thess. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Creating Opportunities: </span><span class="font11">Many publishers have found ways to witness informally. Review your circumstances, and think about the people you are likely to meet on a daily basis. Carry with you appropriate literature and a small Bible. Be observant, and take an interest in people around you. When you have given thought to opportunities that you may encounter during the day, you will likely be ready to give a fine witness.—Phil. 1:12-14; 1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> We have two good reasons for taking advantage of opportunities to witness informally—love for God and love for neighbor. (Matt. 22:37-39) In view of the urgency of the preaching work, informal witnessing cannot be left merely to chance. We should be ready to take advantage of every appropriate opportunity to share the Kingdom good news with others while there is yet time.—Rom. 10:13,14; 2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">3. Following Jesus' example, how have you started a conversation?</span></p></li>

<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Telephone Witnessing Can Be Effective</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Why might we consider using telephone witnessing in our ministry? Because it is another means of helping others to obtain accurate knowledge for gaining salvation. (2 Pet. 3:9) Although our primary method of declaring the good news of God's Kingdom is house-to-house preaching, we willingly take advantage of other methods to reach those who may not be found at home.—Matt. 24:14; Luke 10: 1-7; Rev. 14:6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1. Why might telephone witnessing be considered an important part of our ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> How It Is Organized: </span><span class="font11">As with field service arrangements for house-to-house work, telephone witnessing territory is also provided for the publishers. It may be done alone or with a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">small group of perhaps two or three.</span><span class="font11"> The place that is used should be conducive to the task at hand. Many find it advantageous to sit at a table and have in front of them items that they normally use when preaching from house to house.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How to Witness by Telephone: </span><span class="font11">When witnessing over the telephone, our presentation should be conversational. Some who are just beginning may read a presentation to the householder but in a conversational manner. Introductions found in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> and the tract </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know the Truth?</span><span class="font11"> can be helpful in this regard. When developing your own presentation, identify a theme, develop a question, and be ready to share a few scriptures that provide the answer. Generally you would offer the same publications that are being offered from house to house. Consider the following reminders: Relax and speak slowly. Be courteous, patient, and friendly, as this can be perceived over the phone. Listen as the householder gives his thoughts, then acknowledge and express appreciation for his comments. Be careful not to mention the donation arrangement, as this could be misinterpreted as a form of telephone solicitation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The person you talk to on the telephone may be a shut-in or a person whose work schedule makes it difficult to reach him in the house-to-house ministry. There are others who live in gated communities or in apartments with restricted entrance. Therefore, in an effort to accomplish our ministry more fully and thoroughly, consider using the effective method of telephone witnessing.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">■ What should you do if directed to stop preaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In some instances, the police have approached publishers who were sharing in some form of the ministry, informed them that they were violating the law, and directed them to stop. You should promptly and politely leave the territory if directed to do so. (Matt. 5:41; Phil. 4:5) Do not try to resolve matters on your own by getting involved in a discussion about our legal rights. If it is possible, tactfully obtain the badge number of the police officer and the number of his precinct. Thereafter, promptly inform the elders, who will then contact the branch office about the incident. Similarly, if you are asked to leave an apartment building or complex by the superintendent or any other apartment representative, you should comply immediately and inform the elders. A mild and humble manner of dealing with those in authority can do much to prevent unnecessary difficulties. -Prov. 15:1; Rom. 12:18.</span></p>

We should “widen out,” putting forth an effort to get to know all our brothers and sisters well. (2 Cor. 6:11-13) That would obviously include getting to know them by name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Brothers who conduct congregation meetings should try to get to know the names of all who attend. Calling on each one by nam4 from the platform makes them feel that their comments are appreciated, and at the same time, it helps others to know their names. Of course, there will always be some newer ones or visitors in the audience, making it difficult for anyone to know every name. Nevertheless, a continuing sincere effort is encouraging to others and reflects a genuine personal interest. —Rom. 1:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Take the Initiative to Get Well Acquainted: Traveling overseers are usually able to get well acquainted with a large number of brothers and sisters. How do they do it? In three principal in our outlook. The prosperity of the worldwide work and the increasing evidence of the nearness of the great tribulation should motivate all of us to do our utmost in serving with godly devotion. (2 Pet. 3:11, 14) Zealous activity during August would be a fine way to show our appreciation for what we have learned We also want newly ass</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ociated one</span><span class="font11">s to display a positi</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ve attitude</span><span class="font11"> toward using what they are being taught. If some of our Bible students have progressed to them started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Whether serving as publishers or as pioneers, all of us are helped if we keep in mincf that what Jehovah asks of us is not burdensome. (1 John 5:3) He prom-isestosustalnus.(Heb. 13:5b, 6) In spite <a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark4">1</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>of public indifference, apathy, or resistance, we must be positive and keepjai ■&gt; preaching because it is God’s will that we do so.—1 Tim. 2:3,4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ ways: (1) They regularly work with them in the field service; (2) as their circumstances permit, they accept invi- _■&gt; tations to visit them in their homes; \ and (3) they take the initiative to greet both adults and children at the meet- ''' ings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Can you see ways to widen out in your associations and get to know your brothers better? We can certainly Invite others to accompany us in the field service. Going from house to house, making return visits, going on Bible studies, or doing street witnessing with magazines are all excellent ways to get well acquainted. It is also good to Invite others to visit your home, perhaps sharing a meal or light refreshments occasionally. Taking the initiative to approach new ones or those who tend to be shy not only does much to upbuild them spiritually but also brings rich rewards.—Acts 20:35; 1 Thess. 5:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ Paul knew his brothers well. His making personal reference to many of them by name in his letters was proof of his unselfish interest in them and his genuine love for them. (1 Thess. 2:17;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">2 Tim. 4:19, 20) Our efforts to know our brothers well will mean blessings for all of us.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Keep Walking Progressively in an Orderly Routine</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul had a special affection for the congregation in Philippi, which he was instrumental in forming. He was grateful for their kind material provisions and spoke of them as a gooff example. —2 Cor. 8:1-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Paul’s letter to the Philippians was prompted by deep love. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Insight</span><span class="font12"> book, Volume. 2, page 631, reports; “Throughout the letter he encourages the Philippian congregation to continue in their fine course—seeking greater discernment and getting a sure grip on the Word of life, a stronger faith, and hope in the prize to come.” They </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">respo</span><span class="font12">nded warmly, cementing a bond of love between them and the apostle. Paul’s words take on special meaning for us today, giving us good reason to reflect carefully on his admonition, particularly what is stated at Philippians 3:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> A Mature Mental Attitude Is Essential: </span><span class="font12">At Philippians 3:15, Paul wrote as a man with years of experience. He acknowledged the Philippians’ spiritual advancement, appealing to them as mature Christians with a right mental attitude. As long as their mental attitude reflected the humility and appreciation demonstrated by Jesus, they would continue to be “blameless and innocent, children of God without a blemish .... keeping a tight grip on the word of life.” (PhiL 2:15, 16) When we read Paul’s words, we should feel that he is talking to us. Thus we earnestly desire to have the same mental attitude that Jesus had and to display humble appreciation for our privileges. We continually appeal to Jehovah in prayer, asking for help in this and in other matters. —Phil. 4:6,7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> As Philippians 3:16 indicates, all of us should endeavor to make progress. The word “progress” means “moving forward, making advancement.” People who are progressive are “interested in ne\y ideas, findings, or opportunities.” Paul wanted the Philippians to understand that Christianity is never stagnant and those who profess it must keep moving forward. Their progressive spirit would be demonstrated by a willingness to examine themselves, to acknowledge their weaknesses, and to reach out for opportunities to do more or to improve the quality of what they were doing. Today Jehovah’s earthly organization keeps moving forward progressively, ever expanding its scope of activity and its understanding of God’s Word. Each one of us must keep pace with it, taking advantage of all its provisions and sharing fully in its work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Progress Requires an Orderly Routine: </span><span class="font12">Paul continued by urging his brothers to “go on walking orderly in this same routine.” (Phil. 3:16) Being orderly requires us to put persons or things in their proper places in relation to one another and to be well behaved. The Christians in Philippi kept themselves in their proper place, staying close to Jehovah’s organization and to one another. Their lives were governed by the law of love. (John 15:17; PhiL 2:1,2) Paul urged them to “behave in a manner worthy of the good news.” (PhiL 1:27) The need for orderliness and fine behavior is just as important for Christians today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> A routine is a habitual performance of an established procedure. It is thus closely related to a customary way of doing things. Having a routine can work to our advantage because we do not have to pause and deliberate when making decisions about our next step—we have already established a set pattern that we follow by force of habit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> An orderly theocratic routine consists of habits and customs that are wholesome, beneficial, godly —with the objective of building ourselves up spiritually, helping others, and, if possible, doing more in Jehovah’s service. Success in achieving these goals requires establishing and maintaining a routine that includes personal study, regular attendance atmegt-ings, and participation in the preachin</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">g wo</span><span class="font12">rk.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Essentials Included in an Orderly Routine: </span><span class="font12">One essential is “accurate knowledge and f</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ull dis</span><span class="font12">cernment.” (Phil. 1:9) Personal study deepens our faith, strengthens our appreciation for the truth, and motivates us toward fine works. However, some have found it difficult to be consistent in their study habits. One of the principal reasons given is a lack of time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> The benefits of reading the Bible daily cannot be overemphasized. Its instruction is “beneficial” in every way. (2 Tim. 3:16,17) </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">How ca</span><span class="font12">n </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">we fi</span><span class="font12">nd time for Bible study in our daily routine? Some have found that they can get up a few minutes </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">earli</span><span class="font12">er each morning, when their mind is alert. Others find that they do better when reading a few minutes before retiring at night. Wives who are at home during the day may be able to set aside a little time in the afternoons before others get home from work or school. In addition to regular Bible reading, some have included reading of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers</span><span class="font12"> book in their weekly study routine.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> When we establish new habits, there is a real possibility that they will conflict with our former habits. In the past we may have been inclined to allow nonessential activities to consume available time. Breaking away from that pattern is not easy. No one is going to dictate our study habits; nor are we required to make an accounting of what we do in this regard. The consistency of our study habits depends largely on our appreciation of “the more important things” and our willingness to buy out “the opport unetime” to benefit from them.—Phil. 1:10; Eph. 5:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> Christian meetings play a vital role in our spiritual progress, providing necessary instruction and encouragement. Hence, attending meetings is another essential part of our orderly routine. Paul emphasized the importance of this. It is npt.an option determined by preference—Heb. 10:24,25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> How can orderliness be displayed when we plan our weekly schedule of activity? Some arrange for specific times to care for personal pursuits and then try to squeeze the meetings into any available openings, but it should be the other way around. Our weekly meetings should be given priority, with other activities plarmed around them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>13</sup> Regular meeting attendance requires good planning and family cooperation. On weekdays most of us have a busy schedule of activity that often leaves us pressed for time. This means that, if possible, the evening meal must be scheduled early enough for the family to have sufficient time to eat, get ready, and arrive at the meeting before it begins. To that end family members can cooperate in various ways.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>14</sup> Regular field service is indispensable if we are to keep walking progressively in an orderly routine. All of us clearly recognize our weighty responsibility to preach the Kingdom message. That is what makes us Jehovah’s Witnesses. (Isa. 43:10) Since it is the most urgent and beneficial work being performed today, there is no way that we can properly view it as ,an incidental part of our routine. Paul admonished: “Let us </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">always</span><span class="font12"> offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name?,—Heb. 13:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>18</sup> Whenwe plan our activity for each week, specific times should be set aside for field service. Likely the congre</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">gati</span><span class="font12">on has meetings for service arranged several times each week, and it is simply a matter of deciding whic</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">h one</span><span class="font12">s we can support. It would be good to reach out for a share in each feature of service, such as doing house-to-house work with magazines and other literature, making return visits, and conducting Bible studies. We may even .plan, ahead to do.informal witnessing by carrying literature and being alert to opportunities to start conversations. Since we usually go out with others, we need to inquire about their schedule so that we can make arrangements that will be mutually convenient.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>16</sup> Our routine of preaching should be maintained despite indifference in the territory. We know in advance that only a few will respond favorably. (Matt. 13:15; 24:9) Ezekiel was commissioned to preach to people who were ‘rebellious, insolent, and hardhearted.’ Jehovah promised to </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">help</span><span class="font12"> Ezekiel by making his &quot;forehead exactly as hard as their foreheads,” that is, “like a diamond, harder than flint.” (Ezek. 2:3, 4; 3:7-9) A regular routine for service therefore req</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">uires </span><span class="font12">per</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">severan</span><span class="font12">ce.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> Good Examples to Imitate: </span><span class="font12">Most of us d</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">o bet</span><span class="font12">ter in field service when there is </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">someone</span><span class="font12"> t</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">o take</span><span class="font12"> the lead. Paul and his companions set a good example, and he urged others to imitate him. (Phil. 3:17) His routine included all the elements needed to keep himself spiritually strong.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>18</sup> Today, too, we are blessed with fine examples. At Hebrews 13:7, Paul urged: “Remember those who are taking the lead among you,... and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith.” Of course, Christ is our Exemplar, but we can imitate the faith exercised by those taking the lead. Like Paul, the elders must be conscious of the need to be good examples to others. While their personal circumstances may vary, each one should be able to show that he is maintaining an orderly routine in keeping Kingdom interests first. Even with secular and family obligations, elders should have well-established habits in personal study, meeting attendance, and taking the lead in the field service. By elders’ giving evidence that they are ‘presiding over their households in a fine maimer,’ all in the congregation will be encouraged to keep walking in an orderly routine.—1 Tim. 3:4,5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> Goals for the New Service Year: </span><span class="font12">The beginning of a new service year is a fitting time to reflect on our personal routine. What does a review of our activity for the p</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ast</span><span class="font12"> year show? Were we able to maintain, or possibly</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">lmprove</span><span class="font12">, our level of activity? We may have been more thorough in oufpersbnal study. We may have attended meetings with better regularity or may have increased our field service by enrolling as auxiliary pioneers. Perhaps we are able to point to specific acts of Christian kindness we have performed in behalf of others in our congregation or family. If so, we can rejoice that we have walked in a way that pleases God, and we have good reason to “keep on doing it more fully.”—1 Thess. 4:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>20</sup> What if our routine was somewhat inconsistent or sporadic? How were we affected spiritually? Was our progress hindered for some reason? Improvement begins with a request for Jehovah’s help. (Phil. 4:6,13) Discuss your needs with the rest of the family, requesting their help in adjusting aspects of your routine. If you have problems, ask the elders for assistance. If we make an earnest effort and respond to Jehovah’s direction, we can be sure that we will avoid “being either inactive or unfruitful.”—2 Pet. 1: 5-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>21</sup> Walking in an orderly routine leads to blessings that make your efforts worthwhile. As you determine to walk progressively in an orderly routine, “do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit. Slave for Jehovah.” (Rom. 12:11)—For a more detailed treatment of this subject, see </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower A </span><span class="font12">of May 1,1985, pages 13-17.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> As you know, good organization and careful scheduling are required if you are to succeed as a pioneer. While there Is usually not a lot of time for recreation, a pioneer’s brief periods of relaxation often prove to be more satisfying and rewarding. (Prov. 19: 17; Acts 20:35) By keeping busy in the service, you are protected from the Influence of the self-seeking, take-it-easy way of life pursued by the world. Jehovah has promised that he will make you spiritually rich if you are self-sacrificing and put Kingdom interests first. You are sure to experience genuine joy and contentment by being wholehearted in Jehovah’s service. —Prov. 10:22; Col. 3:23,24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Should the full-time ministry be viewed as a privilege open only to a special few? No. In view of our dedication vow, every Christian should give serious consideration to full-time service unless circumstances make it impossible.—Mark 12:30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If your health and Scriptural responsibilities clearly do not allow you to pioneer at present, you can be assured that Jehovah knows and understands. He will reward you for your faithfulness in what your circumstances permit. (1 Cor. 4:2; 2 Cor. 8:12) If, though, it now seems favorable for you to pioneer again, why not approach the presiding overseer and request an application?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Can Your Family Help? You may have left the ranks because you needed to care for family obligations. Is it possible that other family members are now in a position to give assistance that would enable you to reenter the pioneer work? For some, with just a little help in caring for certain responsibilities, pioneering can once again be attainable.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>11</sup> Good cooperation and a little extra effort on the part of other family members might make this possible. Help might take the form of assistance with finances or transportation, as well as regular appointments to work together in service. Likely there are other ways they can assist. If circumstances do not permit you to take up this privilege of service again, perhaps such assistance can be given to another family member who can do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Why not discuss this matter as a family? The prospects may be good if you make it a united project. If another pioneer can be added to the ranks, the whole household can rightly feel that they are having a share. Such a generous spirit will not only add to the Kingdom witness in the territory but will also draw the family closer together spiritually—Luke 6:38; Phil. 2:2-4.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">—Valuable Tools for the Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> A skilled craftsman usually carries an assortment of tools, each designed for a specific task. As Kingdom pro-claimers, we have a large assortment of brochures to help us skillfully meet the spiritual needs of the people to whom we preach. (Prov. 22:29) At one door you may meet someone who is depressed. At another the householder longs for honest government, while someone else wonders if there is any purpose in living. How can we use our brochures to help these people?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> When offering the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?,” you might say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Some people who observe the suffering and injustice in the world tend to blame it all on God. They reason that since God is almighty, he would put an end to our suffering if he really cared for us. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.] Psalm 72:12-14 shows that God does indeed care about us. Suffering and injustice are not his fault. He has promised that wrongdoers will soon be removed. This brochure. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?,</span><span class="font11"> shows what he will do and how we can benefit.&quot; You may be able to continue the discussion with comments on page 27, paragraph 22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you are using the “Purpose of Life” brochure, you might want to begin this way:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Sooner or later, nearly everyone wonders about the purpose of life. Is it merely to live 70 or 80 years and then go to the grave? Or is there more to life? What do you think? [Allow for response. ] Here at Psalm 37:29, we see God’s beautiful purpose for man and the earth.” After reading the scripture, turn to the illustration on page 31. and comment further about what it will be like to live in Paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'The “Look!” brochure could be introduced by displaying the entire cover illustration and asking:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ “What do you think it would take to make the earth look like this? [Allow for comment.] Everyone in this picture has a home and enjoyable work. There is peace and plenty to eat, and the earth is without pollution. Hard as they may try, human governments find it is impossible for them to bring about such a world. However, the Bible assures us that God will ‘make all things new.’ [Turn to page 30, and read Revelation 21:3, 4.] This brochure can help you learn what you need to do to live in that new world.” If sufficient Interest is shown, turn to page 3, and demonstrate how we conduct a Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> You might use this approach with the “Life on Earth” brochure:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Many people think they will have to go to heaven in order to enjoy everlasting life, but what would you think of living on earth forever? [Allow for a response.] The Bible assures us that eternal life is possible, and it tells us how we can reach that goal.&quot; Read John 17:3. Then show the householder illustration 49 and ask: “How would you like to live in a world like this?” Offer the brochure, and arrange for a return visit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> The brochures feature timely subjects, answer people’s questions, and give comfort. Using these tools skillfully, we can help sincere ones to “come to an accurate knowledge of truth.&quot; —1 Tim. 2:4.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Cultivating Interest on Return Visits</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The ministry has rightly been likened to farming, and making return visits has been compared to cultivating and watering. (Matt. 13:23; Luke 10:2; 2 Cor. 9:10) As “God’s fellow workers,&quot; we have an obligation to help any newly sprouted seed to grow to maturity and become fruitful. (1 Cor. 3:6,9) How can we best accomplish this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Be prompt in making return visits on all who show interest. Review your house-to-house records, and decide whom to visit and what to discuss. Generally your subject for discussion will be determined by what was discussed on the initial visit. Be flexible, having in mind other Scriptural thoughts that may be introduced. It is always good to use the Bible, recognizing its power to reach the heart.—Heb. 4:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you left the brochure “Does God Really Care A bout Us?, ” you might begin by saying something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Many sincere people believe that</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">God is going to destroy the earth, while others fear that man will do that himself. What do you think? [Allow for response.] The Bible tells us that instead of destroying the earth, God will’ cleanse it of unrighteousness, making it a place of peace and security.&quot; Direct attention to page 22, and read Proverbs 2:21, 22, which is quoted there. If interest is manifest, explain the home Bible study arrangement or offer the latest magazines, and make an appointment to return and discuss more about God's promised ndw world.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If you placed the “Look!” brochure, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “On my previous visit, we read in the Bible about God’s promise to make the earth a paradise, like the one illustrated on the cover of the brochure I left with you. We can enjoy this blessing by learning more about God’s will and how it affects us.” Read John 17:3, and then turn to paragraphs 52 and 53 on page 27. Briefly discuss why there is a need to take in accurate knowledge of God’s Word.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> When following up a placement of the “Purpose of Life” brochure with a person who is religiously inclined, you may find it appropriate to say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Very likely you've repeated the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Lord’s Praye</span><span class="font11">r many' times. </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">What </span><span class="font11">thought comes to your </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">mind</span><span class="font11"> when you ask for God's Kingdom to come?&quot; Following the householder’s response, refer to paragraphs 8 and 9 on page 26, and then read Daniel 2:44. Perhaps you could continue the conversation by explaining that the coming of God’s Kingdom will mean an end to wickedness and suffering. Point out that if we are righteous in God’s eyes, we can enjoy everlasting life in Paradise on this earth.’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Remember that a return visit can be made on anyone who </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">was willing to </span><span class="font11">listen, whether lite</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">rature was placed or </span><span class="font11">not. Try to set aside some time every week for making return visits. Jehovah will bless your diligent effort to cultivate the interest you find. May it bear fruitage to his praise.—John 15:8.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Our special assembly day program starting in September will feature the theme “Keep Bearing Witness to the Truth.&quot; The entire program will focus on the example Jesus left us and how he took advantage of every opportunity to share the truth with others. It will emphasize our responsibility as disciples of Christ to imitate him in bearing witness to the truth.—1 Cor. 11:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The role the congregation plays in promoting the truth will be considered. Making good use of our magazines and other publications will also be stressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’The principal talk by the visiting speaker is entitled “Bearing Witness to the Truth—What It Accomplishes.&quot; (John 8:32) This special assembly day program will surely deepen our appreciation for the truth and help all of us to remain steadfast and “firmly set in the truth.”—2 Pet. 1:12; 1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> In the past few years, onlyl out of 3 persons in attendance at the Memorial was a publisher of the good news. Likely the same will be true this year. Some may attend at the urging of a relative or an acquaintance who lives in another city, while others may have been invited by local publishers. Still others who attend, although baptized, are no longer active in the ministry. We sincerely welcome all who show respect for Jesus’ command'. “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.’’—1 Cor. 11:24; Rom. 15:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Assigned attendants should be alert to welcome everyone, especially a new one, as he arrives at the Kingdom Hall. However, all of us can have a share in following the course of hospitality at the Memorial. (Rom. 12:13) How so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> On that evening some publishers will be very busy providing transportation for interested people. Others may be able to arrive early and be on hand to greet visitors who come on their own.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">When a str</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">anger</span><span class="font6"> enters the hall, greet him warmly, and start a conversation. Ask him if he knows anyone in the local congregation. If he does, take care of him until that individual arrives. (Compare Luke 10:35.) If he does not know anyone personally, why not invite him to sit with you during the meeting? Explain hbw the wine and the bread will be used during the program. He may need your assistance in looking up scriptures quoted by the speaker.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> At the conclusion of the Memorial celebration, let him know you are pleased he </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">cam</span><span class="font6">e He may have questions about our work that you can answer. Your personal interest may lead to a discussion on some Bible topic, either at the Kingdom Hall or elsewhere. Some excellent st</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">udies</span><span class="font6"> have been started b</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">y alert brothers</span><span class="font6"> who have taken this commendable initiative. Before he leaves the Kingdom Hall, i</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ntro</span><span class="font6">r duce him </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">to others</span><span class="font6">, and give him a warm invitation </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">to retu</span><span class="font6">rn.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> What a pleasure it is to welcome our dear brothers and sisters who have not been attending the meetings regularly or have not been active in the ministry for some time! Rather than </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">asking </span><span class="font6">questions about wh</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">y tfiey</span><span class="font6"> have stayed away, simply express yb</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ur Joy to h</span><span class="font6">ave them present. Perhaps something they hear during the Memorial discourse will move them to reevaluate their dedicated relationship with Jehovah. The warm welcome you give and the genuine concern you display may touch their hearts. Let them know that you look forward to seeing them again.—Rom. 1: 11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> A special public talk entitled “True Religion Meets the Needs of Human Society” will be given in most congregations oh April 10. Make sure that all who attend the Memorial celebration are invited and </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">assisted to be pre</span><span class="font6">sent. It is our hope that those attending these special meetings will feel welcome and experience the warm spirit of fellowship among Jehovah's people.—Ps. 133:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Benefiting Ourselves: It Is estimated that in most congregations </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">only </span><span class="font6">a third of the audience study the lesson in advance.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> When preparing for the study, you may find it helpful first to read and think about the questions in the box near the end of the article. These can X help focus vour attention o</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">n the main </span><span class="font6">points to be considered in the lesson.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> During the study listen carefully to what is said. Pay attention to the conductor’s ope</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ning</span><span class="font6"> remarks; these comments set the stage for the study. He may raise three or four questions that will be answered, or he may review some highlights from last week’s lesson if this week’s is a continuation of the same subject. If there is some adjustment </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">in our understanding o</span><span class="font6">f a Bible prophecy or a Scriptural principle, he will call this to our attention. Of course, comments by the conductor must be brief, since one purpose of the study is to give the congregation an opportunity to express their hope. Listen care-your faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> Declare Your Hope: Do you regularly offer comments during the study? Brief, poin</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ted remarks</span><span class="font6"> are preferred. (Compare Luke 21:1-4.) A si</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">mple com</span><span class="font6">ment fro</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">m the hea</span><span class="font6">rt is appreciated by all. Usually the first comment on a question should be brief and direct. This allows others to bring in a scripture or draw attention to a detail in the paragraph. In t</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">his way many c</span><span class="font6">a</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">n make </span><span class="font6">public declaration of their hope. Comments should always be positive and upbuilding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> If you have just started attending the study or if you are </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">nervous</span><span class="font6"> about commenting, you may wish to ask the conductor for assistance. Ask him to look for your hand when a certain paragraph is considered. Perhaps you can volunteer </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">to</span><span class="font6"> read a_citedschpture text and make a brief application of its meaning. You might make a fe</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">w notes </span><span class="font6">in the m</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">argin</span><span class="font6"> to help you recall what you want to say when you comment. If you are a y</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">oungste</span><span class="font6">r, remember that your comments are welcome and appreciated—Matt. 21:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">~ It is vital that we e</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">xpres</span><span class="font6">s </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">our falt.h</span><span class="font6">, and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> St</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">udy provides</span><span class="font6"> a fine opportunity to do so. If you are hesitant to comment, do what you can to overcome the problem, and </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">make </span><span class="font6">your</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">self give at least one answe</span><span class="font6">r.

<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Although the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax </span><span class="font6">book is being featured this month, you may decide to offer the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask</span><span class="font6"> book if you talk to a parent ora youth who is concerned about the problems that perplex young people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* Youmayfind it appropriate to say something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Growing up in these troubled times is not easy. Youths face many new situations that require them to make weighty decisions. ‘Should I drink? Take drugs? What conduct is proper with the opposite sex?' When young people ask about these basic issues, they are often barraged with conflicting answers. Where do you think many of them turn for advice? [Allow comments.] This book. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work,</span><span class="font6"> provides helpful information. [Direct attention to the table of contents, showing the variety of subjects covered.] Youths need answers that are straightforward and realistic. The answers in this book are backed by what the Bible has to say.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'Here is another presentation you might be able to use: </span><span class="font6">■ “Young people are subjected to many pressures today. They need help to cope successfully. When we are trying the best we can to help them, don’t we look for something that provides practical guidance? [Allow for comment.] Some of the most intense pressures come from other youths, their peers. Notice the pictures on pages 76 and 77 in this book. [Direct attention to the captions for these pictures and to the Italicized paragraphs on page 77.] The following pages in this chapter outline honest, workable answers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ These certainly are “critical times hard to deal with,&quot; especially for young people. (2 Tim. 3:1) The book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask</span><span class="font6"> can really help a young person to face today’s challenges successfully. The 39 chapters are richly illustrated, and the articles are realistic and practical. So whenever the occasion arises, be alert to use this fine publication.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Praise to Jehovah During April?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> The psalmist David had a heartfelt desire to acceptably praise Jehovah, and so he declared/&quot;! shall laud Jehovah very much with my mouth, and in among many people I shall praise him.&quot; (Ps. 109:30) April is a fine time to 'add to all his praise’ by increasing our share in the field ministry. (Ps. 71:14) Ar</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">e you planning</span><span class="font6"> to be among the many who do this by joining the auxiliary pioneer ranks?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Plan Now: ’’The plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage,&quot; j we are reminded at Proverbs .21:5. This calls for your taking the matter to Jeh</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ovah in prayer,</span><span class="font6"> putting him firstin your plans. (Prov. 3:5,6) Next, take a close look at your current schedule to determine where adjustments can be made to spend an average of two hours a day in the ministry. Your “buying out&quot; time from other activities allows you to devote more time to the preaching work. —Eph. 5:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Communicate and Cooperate: The apostle Paul spoke of certain ones who were “a strengthening aid” to him in accomplishing his ministry. (Col. 4:11) Discuss your plans with others who want to enroll in April. Their support and companionship can bring mutual spiritual benefits. The service overseer c</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">an help y</span><span class="font6">ou if you have questions about service arrangements or territory to work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">* Cooperation and support from within the family can help individual members to auxiliary pioneer Household chores may have to be temporarily redistributed. The schedule for handling these duties may also need adjusting. A family conference to discuss these needs couldbe helpful in accomplishing your objective. Good communication and cooperation are the key to success.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> Keep a Positive Outlook: </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Do not b</span><span class="font6">e quic</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">k to ru</span><span class="font6">l</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">e out auxiliary pioneering </span><span class="font6">because of unfavorable circumstances. You</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ng people</span><span class="font6"> in </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">scho</span><span class="font6">ol, retired people, housewives with children? family heads working full-time, all have been able to make the sacrifice—and gladly so—to auxiliary pioneer in April. They agree with the psalmist that “on the part of the upright ones praise is fitting,&quot; and they have </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">not </span><span class="font6">considered it too costly to put forth the extra effort required to spend 60 hours in the ministry. (Ps. 33:1) If you are unable to enroll, why n</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ot sha</span><span class="font6">re in the joy by increasing your activity as a congregation publisher?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> For many, auxiliary pioneering in April has been a stepping-stone to the regular pioneer service. Having built up their activity, they found that the transition to the regular pioneer work proved to be much easier.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> Yes, the season lends itself to increased theocratic activity in April. The additional hours of daylight allow for doing more witnessingdn the morning and early evening. We want to do all we can to praise our God, Jehovah. Auxiliary pioneering in April is a fine way to show our appreciation for his many acts of undeserved kindness toward us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">'The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font6"> book has helped us to understand the thrilling message recorded in the book of Revelation. Help others appreciate how that message affects them by featuring this book in the ministry during March. You may find the following suggestions helpful in preparing your presentation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> After an appropriate greeting, you might say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Have you ever </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">hear</span><span class="font6">d of the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">four </span><span class="font6">horsemen of the Apocalypse? [Allow for replyj Different explanations as to what these horsemen represent have been given. But did you know that their symbolic ride is actually part of a Bible prophecy foretelling events that have occurred in our time and that all of us are involved in one way or another? [Allow for reply.) Would you be Interested in understanding this prophecy and what its fulfillment means to us?&quot; If genuine interest is shown, you could point to the illustrations in chapter 16 of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font6"> book and tie in some of the verses in bold type. Or you could comment on some aspect of the vision by using the t</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ract Wtfl </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">This </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World Survive?</span><span class="font6"> If interest is shown, </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">of</span><span class="font6">fer the book, or arrange to return to discuss more about the vision and its meaning.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">■ “Have you ever heard the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">term ‘Ar</span><span class="font6">mageddon'? [Allow for reply.] Many have </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">thought t</span><span class="font6">hat it refers to a devastating n</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">uclear w</span><span class="font6">ar in our time. Actually, Armageddon is something quite different. According to the Bible, it will mean ma</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">jor chan</span><span class="font6">ges for the better, resulting in a world of lasting peace.” Depending on the person’s response, you can point to a s</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">criptu</span><span class="font6">re such as Revelation 16:16 or Psalm 3710J1 and then direct attention to </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">chapter 39 o</span><span class="font6">f the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font6"> book.

Otherwise, you may choose to consider appropriate points in the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* You may be able to create interest by using this suggestion: </span><span class="font6">■ “At this time of year, many all over the world are thinking about the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Did you ever wonder what he has been doing since his resurrection? Many thriH-ing events in our day are linked with Jesus' present role In God's purpose.

Would </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">you like to le</span><span class="font6">arn more about God's purpose in sending his Son to the earth and what that means for you and your loved ones?” You may be able to draw attention to paragraphs 1 and 2 of_chapter_41 of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font6"> book or highlight appropriate p</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">oints from current </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">\ssnesofThp</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Watchtomer</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;"> nr </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> Or you may want to use the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peacefid New World</span><span class="font6"> to stimulate further interest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Our preaching work gives people the opportunity to ‘hear the. words of Revelation’s prophecy.’ (Rev. 1:3) But if they are to survive “the great tribulation,&quot; they must also act on them.

<p><span class="font6">■ “It’s good to see you again. The last time we spoke, we talked about one of the prophecies of the book of Revelation, and I left you a publication that explains it. You probably noticed that although the book of Revelation is quite deep, it can be understood in the light of present -day happenings by applying a number of fundamental Bible truths. I would like to take a few minutes to highlight a few things that the Bible tells us about our times.” Then turn to an appropriate publication that you can use to start a home Bible study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">■ Tm happy to find you at home today. When I visited you recently, we talked about events making up a sign that would occur just before the end of the world. [Review appropriate aspects of the sign at Matthew 24:3-14.] Have you noticed any event that has taken place lately In the world or in our community that you think might be a fulfillment of part of that sign?” Using the illustrations in chapter 16 of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font6"> book, comment on the fulfillment of some of these Bible prophecies. At the conclusion'of the visit, mention the title of the public talk for the week, and extend an invitation to join you at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">' If you invited the householder to the Memorial, say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ “When I last visited you, we talked about how important Jesus’ death is to mankind.

[State time and place of celebration.] It may help you appreciate the significance of the occasion if we review some of the blessings that we now enjoy as a result of what Jesus did for mankind, as well as the blessings that are yet to come.” Then endeavor to discuss appropriate points from one of the current magazines or from chapter 41 of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font6"> book.

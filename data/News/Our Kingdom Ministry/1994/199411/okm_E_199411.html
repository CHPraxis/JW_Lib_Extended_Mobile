<p><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">November 1994 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 37, No. 11</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>God’s Word Has</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The Bible has greatly influenced the lives of millions. What it says is more motivating than anything man could produce. (Heb. 4:12) Look at what it has done for us. Truly, its worth is beyond compare.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah's Witnesses are the foremost students and advocates of the Bible. We should view Bible reading as a vital part of our regular theocratic schedule, giving it priority over television viewing and all other recreational pursuits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Make It a Regular Habit: </span><span class="font8">Jehovah's people have come to appreciate the powerful influence that regular Bible reading can exert. For many years a large sign on one of our factory buildings In Brooklyn has been urging passersby to “Read God's Word the Holy Bible Daily.” New members of the Bethel famtty are required to read the entire Bible during their first year of Bethel service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">* Despite your busy schedule, are you keeping up with the suggested weekly Bible reading outlined In the Theocratic Ministry School Schedule? If you have experienced difficulty in doing this, why not work to improve during November? The Bible reading for the entire month Is Psalms 95-109, which requires reading about three or_four pages a week. Some choose to do a little reading each day, perhaps early in the morning or before retiring at night. However you do it, the important thing is that you reap the wholesome benefits to be gained by regularly reading God's Word.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Offer the Bible During November: </span><span class="font8">Many people still have respect for the Bible and are willing to listen when we read from it. During November we will be offering the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font8">and the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man's?</span><span class="font8"> This presents a splendid opportunity to show honesthearted ones the value of God’s Word. Be enthusiastic in doing that.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Prepare some thoughtful comments on the outstanding features of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font8"> that will stimulate the people’s interest in obtaining it. Highlight its practical value. You could feature one of the topics in the section &quot;Bible Topics for Discussion” and tie that in with the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?</span><span class="font8"> Or you might demonstrate the value of the 92-page index of Bible words by showing how it enables a reader to locate familiar texts. Some publishers may want to highlight either the “Appendix” or the “Table of the Books of the Bible” by showing its value in Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Be sure to point out that the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font8"> is in modem English, which makes it easy toun-derstand. Some interesting comparisons with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version </span><span class="font8">are 1 Corinthians 10:25 and 16:22. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font8"> uses the divine name, Jehovah, 7,210 times.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Yes. the Bible is God’s Word. If we read it. believe It. and apply its counsel in our lives, we will reap great benefits. It was written to give us instruction and hope. (Rom. 15:4) It is vital that we consult it every day and that we be ready to use it to teach others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ways to Improve Our Kingdom Preaching</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Our preaching work is more urgent now than ever before. Whether people live or die will depend on their reaction to the good news. (1 Pet. 4:5, 6, 17; Rev. 14:6, 7) For this reason we should always look for ways to improve our Kingdom preaching. What are some ways to make improvement?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Prepare Well: </span><span class="font8">Using the current issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font8"> select a presentation that you feel would appeal to most people in your territory. It is Important to adapt your remarks to local circumstances. Or you may prefer to prepare a presentation of your own, using ideas and Scripture texts that you have personally found to be effective. You will need an interestarousing Introduction. (See </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font8">book, pages 9-15.) Perhaps you plan to ask a thought-provoking question or to request the householder’s comment on some news item of local interest. When you have your presentation in mind, practice it with a family member or another publisher who can offer suggestions for your improvement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Converse With People: </span><span class="font8">Our purpose is to convey an Important message. This can be done by engaging our listener in a meaningful conversation. If the householder raises an objection or offers an opinion, listen carefully to what he has to say. His comments will help you to give a Scriptural answer for the hope within you. (1 Pet. 3:15) If his view does not agree with the, Bible, you might tactfully say: “Many people feel as you do. Yet, here is another way of looking at the subject.&quot; Then read an appropriate text, and get his comment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Have a Flexible Schedule: </span><span class="font8">Being well prepared will be of little value if you are unable to talk to people. Today it Is common to find only a few householders at home when we call. If that is the way it is in your territory, try to adjust your schedule so that you can work from house to house when more people are at home. You might find that the best time to call is on the weekends; others may be more accessible during the week but in the early evening hours. In some areas publishers find it advantageous to witness on worldly holidays because they find more people at home. People are generally in a relaxed mood and may be more willing to converse at such times. It would be good to adapt your introduction to the occasion and then to tie your remarks in with a Scriptural theme.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Analyze the Effectiveness of Your Presentation: </span><span class="font8">After leaving each door, ask yourself: ‘Did I reach the heart of the householder? Did I draw him out and pay attention to what he had to say? Did I answer tactfully? In view of the circumstances, did I use the best approach?’ It may be helpful to work with an experienced publisher or a pioneer from time to time and to listen carefully to his presentations with a view to improving your own effectiveness in the ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> If you are skillful in your work, you will be able to share Kingdom truths that “will save both yourself and those who listen to you.”—1 Tim. 4:16; Prov. 22:29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What Kind of Spirit Do You Show?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Paul concluded his letter to the congregation in Philippi with this exhortation: “The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit you show.” (Phil. 4:23) He commended them for their genuine interest in preaching the good news as well as their warm, loving concern for the well-being of one another. —Phil. 1:3-5; 4:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> It should be our desire to reflect the same spirit in our congregation. When all show zeal, kindness, and hospitality, this creates a spirit that becomes evident to observers. A positive and loving spirit brings unity and spiritual progress. (1 Cor. 1:10) A negative spirit produces discouragement and halfheartedness.—Rev. 3: 15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Elders Take the Lead: </span><span class="font8">The elders have a responsibility to keep a fine, positive spirit among themselves and within their congregation. Why? Because the congregation can be influenced by their attitude and conduct. We appreciate having elders who are zealous in field service, who greet us with a warm smile and a kind word, and who are positive and upbuilding in their counsel, whether given pri</span></p>

There is a great need for this book. Hundreds of millions of people profess to be Jesus’ followers and claim to believe what he taught. People need to know what set him apart from all other men—their salvation depends on it. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font8"> book, chapter 133, states: “Our hearts are moved when we consider his sublime courage and manliness, his unparalleled wisdom, his superb ability as a teacher, his fearless leadership, and his tender compassion and empathy.” The Bible clearly identifies him as (1) a Witness (John 18:37), (2) a Savior (Acts 4:12), and (3) a King (Rev. 11:15). Have a capable publisher demonstrate a presentation using some of these points. Encourage all to share in distributing this book during December.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">‘Of course, all of us should do our share to make the congregation friendly, hospitable, zealous, and spiritually-minded. Individually, we can show warmth and love in our association with others. (1 Cor. 16:14) There should be no distinctions of age, race, education, or financial status among us. (Compare Ephesians 2:21.) Because of our hope, we can reflect a spirit of joy, generous hospitality, and zeal in the ministry.—Rom. 12:13; Col. 3:22,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> All who associate with us, including new ones, should be made to feel welcome and to sense the love and devotion of the brotherhood. By our ministry and by manifesting fine Christian qualities, we give evidence that the congregation is “a pillar and supportof the truth.” (1 Tim. 3:15) We also experience spiritual security by means of &quot;the peace of God” that guards our hearts and mental powers. (Phil. 4:6,7) May all of us diligently strive to show the kind of spirit that will assure us of enjoying Jehovah's undeserved kindness by the Lord Jesus Christ—2 Tim. 4:22.</span></p><img src="okm_E_199411_files/okm_E_199411-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:112pt;height:11pt;">

<p><span class="font8">■ What caution is needed when we work dangerous territory?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Increasingly, we hear reports of violence, muggings, and social disorders. especially in urban areas. Although we feel concerned, we know that even in areas of unrest, there are sincere people who will responcTto the Kingdom message. So at the appropriate time, we must muster up boldness to press forward, confident of Jehovah’s watchcare.—Prov. 29:25; 1 Thess. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> When we go into a potentially dangerous area, Jehovah expects us to be cautious and to use good judgment. Be alert. “Shrewd is the one that has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal himself, but the inexperienced have passed along and must suffer the penalty.” (Prov. 22:3) Experienced publishers appreciate the wisdom of working together in pairs or even in groups of several publishers, if necessary. Ecclesiastes 4: 9.12 states: &quot;Two are better than one ... If somebody could overpower one alone, two together could make a stand against him.” Criminals often look for those who are alone and thus easier to victimize.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Be extra careful about going into apartment buildings with dark hallways and deserted stairwells. Be cautious about accepting an invitation into a house or an apartment. Do not argue with those who may appear to be threatening or challenging. Be quick to identify yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Some publishers always carry a Bible or a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font8">or an </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazine in their hand for the purpose of identification.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Keep an eye on individuals loitering in the area. Be cautious about entering an elevator with others who do not appear to be residents of the building. Do not wear expensive jewelry. If you have to be out after dark, avoid walking down dark streets where there is little traffic. If you are a mugging victim, do not resist if it is only your </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">mone</span><span class="font8">y or possessions they want; your life is worth more than any material thing you possess.—Mark 8:36.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Brothers taking the lead need to be alert, keeping track of publishers in the territory. Usually it is best to keep the group concentrated in the same area so others are always nearby. If any kind of violence or disturbance develops in the neighborhood, the group should leave the territory immediately.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> If we are alert and cautious, we can continue to reach those in high-crime areas who “are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done.”—Ezek. 9:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Blessings That Come From Working With Others</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Do you feel there are benefits to be enjoyed in working with others in the ministry? Jesus did. Although the harvest was great and the workers were few, he sent 70 disciples into the field “by twos.” What a rewarding time all of them had preaching in “every city and place to which he himself was going to come”!—Luke 10:1,17; Matt. 9:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> It is stimulating to work with others. Some of us are shy and find it difficult to approach strangers. Having someone else at our side may give us confidence to speak the Word of God with boldness. When we have someone with us, it may be easier for us to carry out the work in the way that we have been trained. (Prov. 27:17) The wise man said: “Two are better than one.”—Eccl. 4:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> It is good to work with a variety of publishers and pioneers. The apostle Paul’s service companions included Barnabas, Silas. Timothy, and John Mark, and they enjoyed many blessings while preaching together. The same can be true today. Have you worked with someone who has'been in the truth for a long time? After observing his skill in giving a witness, likely you have picked up some good ideas that have helped you improve. Have you accompanied publishers who are relatively new? Then you may have been able to share some of what you have learned and thus may have helped them to be more effective and to find greater joy in their ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Are you presently conducting a Bible study? If so, why not invite one of the elders or the circuit overseer to accompany you? It is beneficial for our Bible students to get acquainted with the overseers. If you are hesitant about conducting the study in the presence of an elder, perhaps he would be willing to conduct It and let you observe. Afterward, feel free to ask him for suggestions on how you can help the student progress more rapidly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Be an encouraging companion when you work with others. Be positive in your comments about the territory. Never gossip about others or complain about congregation arrangements. Keep your mind focused on the ministry and on blessings from Jehovah. If you do, both you and your companions will return home spiritually refreshed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Your circumstances may make it difficult for you to work regularly with other brothers and sisters. However, if possible, why not arrange to have some time for working with another publisher? Both of you will be blessed!—Rom. 1:11,12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible—Source of Comfort and Hop© in a Troubled 5Vorld</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> This world keeps mankind under tremendous pressure and in need of comfort and hope. The Bible is the only source of genuine comfort. It offers hope for a new world of righteousness. (Rom. 15:4; 2 Pet. 3:13) The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Insight </span><span class="font8">book, Volume 1, page 311, observes: “Without the Bible we would not know Jehovah, would not know the wonderful benefits resulting from Christ’s ransom sacrifice, and would not understand the requirements that must be met in order to get everlasting life in or under God’s righteous Kingdom.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> During November we will draw special attention to the role God’s Word, the Bible, plays in helping people to cope with pressures from the world. We will offer the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font8"> and the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God's Word or Man’s?</span><span class="font8"> What can we say that will help rightly disposed individuals to appreciate the value of the Bible?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> After introducing yourself, you could say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Likely you agree that we are surrounded by problems that tend to rob us of our peace of mind. Where can we find practical counsel to show us how to cope with these problems? (Allow for response.] I have found the Bible to be reassuring because it teaches us how to be happy, [Read Luke 11:28.] The purpose of our work is to encourage people to read the Bible and benefit from its instruction. This Bible study aid. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?,</span><span class="font8"> can help you do that. Note what it says about the cause of most of the world’s problems. [Read the second sentence of paragraph 9 on page 187.] If you would like to read this book, I would be happy to leave this copy with you.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> You might choose to use a simple approach like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “We are interested in encouraging greater respect for God’s Word, the Bible. I would like to give you a copy of this tract, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Why You Can Trust the Bible. </span><span class="font8">It explains why we can look to the Bible to find a sure hope for a better world. [Turn to page 6, and read Psalm 37:29 along with the concluding paragraph.] Read this tract for yourself, and the next time I visit, let me know what you think of the hope the Bible offers.&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Some </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">publishers may want to use this direct approach for starting a Bible study:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “I am calling to offer you a free home Bible study course. The Bible is inspired of God, and its instruction can help us set things straight. The modem-language </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font8"> is designed for personal study. It has proved to be popular with millions of Bible readers around the world. Let me briefly demonstrate how you can use it. [Turn to page 1653, and call attention to 23A. According to the interest shown, look up one or two of the cited scriptures and discuss the point being made. Explain how looking up the cited texts will reveal what God has purposed to accomplish by means of his Kingdom.] I would be pleased to return and discuss this Kingdom hope further.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> The Bible is the source of comfort and hope as well as truth that can lead us to everlasting life. (John 17:3, 17) Sharing Bible knowledge with others pleases Jehovah, “whose will is that all sorts of men should be saved.”—1 Tim. 2:4.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Them to Hear “Even Another Time</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> “We will hear you about this even another time.” (Acts 17:32) That was the response of some to Paul’s famous discourse on Mars’ Hill. Likewise today, some are willing to hear more about the Kingdom message that we shared with them on our initial visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> We do most of our teaching when we return to cultivate the interest. Good preparation will help us get positive results. Page 51 of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook </span><span class="font8">recommends: [‘First get the arguments supporting the material clearly in mind. Try to determine why a thing is so. See if you can put the ideas in your own words. Get a good understanding of the Scriptural proofs. Be prepared to apply the scriptures effectively.&quot;^</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you placed the book “The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?,” you might say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “When we spoke previously, we discussed reasons why we can have confidence in the Bible. The book I left with you raises the question, ‘Why Read the Bible?” [Read introduction on page 5, and allow for a response to the concluding question.] The Bible tells us that very soon God himself will solve all mankind’s perplexing problems, and it guides us in the way we must go to enjoy the blessings of that happy time. [Read Psalm 119:105.[This book is designed as an aid to personal and family study of the Bible. I would be pleased to show you how to use it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* On calls where you left the tract “Why You Can Trust the Bible, ” you could say this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “All of us fare interested in what the future holds. In view of present world conditions, what do you think will happen? [Allow for response.] While man can only speculate about what will happen, God knows exactly what will take place. [Read Isaiah 46:10.] It may surprise you to learn that the Bible predicts that we will soon enjoy the blessings of a paradise new world. [Read the third paragraph on page 4.] Let me tell you more about this wonderful promise.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> If you are following up the placement of the “New World Translation, ” perhaps this suggestion would work for you:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Recently, I left a copy of the Bible with you, and I promised to return to help you make the best use of it. At times we may wonder how we can maintain friendly relations with others. The Bible has good advice to offer, and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font8"> makes It easy to find what we need. [Turn to page 1595 and look under the heading “Lo</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">ve(s</span><span class="font8">).” Call attention to such texts as l 'Corinthians 13:4; Colossians 3:14; and 1 Peter 4:8. Briefly explain how applying these principles can produce fine results.] This is one example showing how the Bible offers practical solutions to our problems. Next time, I’d like to show you another way the Bible can help us find happiness and peace of mind.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> There is no greater treasure that we can pass on to others than an accurate knowledge of God’s Word. Such knowledge can teach the fear of Jehovah and encourage people to walk in his way, which brings everlasting blessings. —Prov. 2:20,21.</span></p></li></ul>

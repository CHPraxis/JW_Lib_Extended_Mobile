<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Sowing Bountifully?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> There is a saying: “The more you put into something, the more you get out of it.” This is especially true in our worship. The more time and effort we spend in preparing for meetings, preaching the Kingdom message, and showing love for our brothers, the more we will gain in spiritual growth. The opposite is also true. If we are self-sparing or halfhearted in what we do, can we truly expect satisfying results?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> The apostle Paul stated the principle well at 2 Corinthians 9:6: “He that sows sparingly will also reap sparingly; and he that sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.” Are you sowing bountifully?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Personal Bible Study: </span><span class="font7">To be fruitful ministers, we must first sow bountifully in our personal study. We should have a keen spiritual appetite. (Ps. 119: 97, 105; Matt 5:3) With all the cares of daily life pressing in on us, it takes conscious effort to develop a genuine awareness of our spiritual need. For most of us, it requires “buying out the opportune time.” (Eph. 5:16) Some arrange to get up earlier on certain days to do personal study. Others have set aside some evenings for that purpose. In what way do we reap bountifully? We acquire a stronger faith, a brighter hope, and a happier and more positive frame of mind.—Rom. 10:17; 15:4; 1 Pet. 1:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">'Congregation Meetings: </span><span class="font7">At Psalm 122:1, David said: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’” Do you feel the same? Sowing bountifully means regular attendance at our five weekly meetings. Make up your mind that you are not going to allow unpleasant weather to interfere. Usually, the more obstacles we overcome, the greater our blessings.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Arrive early and linger afterward to share in upbuilding conversation with your brothers. Widen out your associations to include as many different ones as you can. Prepare well for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> Study and other meetings so that you can sow bountifully by commenting as you have opportunity. By “freely watering” others at meetings, you will also be “freely watered.”—Prov. 11:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Field Ministry: </span><span class="font7">Perhaps nowhere is this principle of bountiful sowing more true than in the field ministry. The more time we devote to it, the more likely we are to reap interesting experiences, fruitful return visits, and productive Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>7</sup> Sowing bountifully in the field ministry Involves quality as well as quantity. An excellent aid to help us improve the quality of our ministry is the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font7">book. Pages 9-15 list over 40 introductions covering 18 subjects to help arouse interest at the doors. If you find interest, be sure to take note of it so that you can return and reap the fruitage of your sowing. Hopefully your efforts will lead to a Bible study, and you can teach someone else how to sow bountifully.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>8</sup> If we sow bountifully, we can expect greater blessings from Jehovah.—Mal. 3:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Congregation Book Study Promotes Educational Activities _ ilv</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> The Congregation Book Study plays a vital role in the educational program of Jehovah's organization. The book study groups are scattered throughout the territory, making it convenient for all to attend. With a study located in their own neighborhood, interested ones may more readily accept an invitation to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> An effort is made to keep each group small in size. This allows the conductor to give personal assistance to each one. Not all learn at the same rate. If anyone has difficulty in understanding a point even after studying the lesson in advance, the conductor may discuss it further after the study. Moreover, with a small group, there are more opportunities to make comments and share in reading scriptures. Do you contribute to the discussion by regularly commenting? Do you try to answer in your own words? Your readiness to participate can be beneficial for you and others. As you prepare, use your perceptive powers to discern how you can personally apply certain points in the lesson.—Heb. 5:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> By observing the teaching methods used by the book study conductor, you can learn how to conduct home Bible studies in a more interesting and instructive manner. After the paragraphs are read by a qualified brother, the questions are discussed. The study conductor encourages all to speak up. As time allows, he endeavors to draw out comments on the cited scriptures to help us understand how they apply. (Compare Nehemiah 8:8.) At times he may add a brief clarifying comment of his own or use auxiliary questions to bring out a key point. An example or an illustration may help us see how the information relates to our lives.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">* Meeting attendance at some Congregation Book Studies is rather low. Do you attend re</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">gula</span><span class="font7">rly? If not, you have been missing an Important provision. The book study arrangement is one of the ways in which Jehovah demonstrates his care for us. (1 Pet. 5:7) He wants us to progress in knowledge and wisdom so that we will be strong spiritually. On the other hand, Satan would like to slow down our spiritual growth and weaken us so that we will be less useful to Jehovah and His organization. Do not let this happen! Let the warm, loving atmosphere in this intimate grpupToucfi-your heart and motivate you to continue praising Jehovah. —Compare Psalm 111:1.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Meetings for service convenient to the publishers are arranged at most book study locations. These may be for midweek, weekend, or evening witnessing. The book study conductor makes sure that sufficient territory is on hand and that someone will be present to take the lead in the field. Meetings for field service should last no more than 10-15 minutes. The conductor may briefly consider the daily text if it relates to our preaching activity and offer one or two specific field service suggestions or present a brief demonstration of the current offer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> The conductor endeavors over the course of time to work personally with each one in his group, giving appropriate encouragement and training. —Compare Mark 3:14; Luke 8:1.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">NOTE: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Godly Fear&quot; District Convention and for a 30-minute review of the program highlights the following week. The day-by-day review of the district convention program should be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on outstanding points. This well-prepared review will help the congregation remember key points for personal application and for use in the field. Comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Question Box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">■ How should matters be handled when a householder insists that Jehovah’s Witnesses make no further calls at that home?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we encounter a sign at the door that strictly prohibits calls of a religious nature and specifically mentions Jehovah's Witnesses, it may be best to respect the householder’s wishes and avoid knocking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sometimes we come upon a sign prohibiting salesmen or solicitors. Since we are doing charitable religious work, that does not really apply to us. It would be appropriate to go ahead and knock at such doors. If the householder objects, we can tactfully explain why we feel that such signs do not apply in our case. If the householder then makes it clear that the prohibition includes Jehovah’s Witnesses, we will respect his wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we are working the territory, a householder may become visibly upset and emphatically insist that we do not call again. If he refuses to reason on the matter, we should comply with this request. A </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">dated</span><span class="font7"> note should be placed in the territory envelope so that publishers working the territory in the future will avoid calling at that address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such homes are not to be avoided indefinitely. The present occupants may move away. We may contact another family member who will respond favorably. There is also the possibility that the householder to whom we spoke will have a change of heart and become more agreeable to having us call. So after some time, a tactful inquiry should be made of the occupants to determine their current feelings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The territory file should be reviewed once a year, making a list of the homes where we have been advised not to call. Under the direction of the service overseer, some tactful, experienced publishers can be assigned to visit these homes. It could be explained that we are calling to Inquire if the same householder still lives there. The publisher should be familiar with the material In the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font7"> book, pages 15-24, entitled “How You Might Respond to Potential Conversation Stoppers.” If there is a reasonable response, future calls can be made in the usual way. If the householder continues to be antagonistic, no further calls should be made until the following year. The local body of elders can decide if the circumstances in a particular case make it advisable to handle things differently.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Meaningful Meetings for Field Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> At Luke 10:1-11, we have a record of a meeting Jesus held with the 70 newly assigned disciples to help them prepare for field service. He provided specific directions to help them get organized, prepare what they would say, and deal with difficult situations. We can learn by examining this account.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Evidently all 70 disciples were present for the meeting with Jesus. Much time is wasted at meetings for service if some individuals habitually come late. Their tardy arrival usually makes it necessary to reorganize car groups as well as territory assignments. This often causes the entire group to be delayed. All of us can do our part by arriving on time and being ready to proceed promptly to the territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">’Jesus gave the group a specific topic for conversation to use, namely, “the kingdom of God.&quot; (Luke 10:9) We are assigned to preach the same message, and we usually appreciate some helpful suggestions on what we should say. The conductor may refer to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font7"> book, which offers more than 40 different introductions and appropriate Scripture texts that can be used in a wide variety of situations. A brief review of one or two presentations can help us get something in mind to say, enabling us to speak with more confidence at the doors.</span></p>

Please do not request 32-page booklets, since these are not available from the Society.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">■ Beginning on October 3, 1994, the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!</span><span class="font7"> will be considered at the Congregation Book Study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">■ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make announcement to the congregation when this has been done.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Not only did Jesus tell his disciples what to say but he told them how to say it. (Luke 10:5, 6) Demonstrations featured on the Service Meeting program show us how we can express ourselves effectively. The conductor might review what was presented at the last meeting and give suggestions on how it can be used in service that day. A brief prepared demonstration of a simple Scriptural presentation can help us collect our thoughts and put them into words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Jesus also Instructed his disciples about their personal conduct. (Luke 10:7, 8) The conductor may likewise give us pointed direction to help us avoid anything that might detract from our work. He may caution us about congregating on street comers or wasting time disputing with opposers. He may remind us of the need to keep an accurate house-to-house record or to make the householder aware that contributions are accepted for the worldwide work. Parents may need a reminder about carefully supervising their children.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> The 70 disciples cooperated with Jesus’ instructions and afterward “returned with joy.&quot; (Luke 10:17) If we respond to direction we receive at meetings for service, we too can anticipate increased joy In preaching the Kingdom message.—Acts 13:48, 49, 52.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping Others to Honor Our Maker</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Do we feel as did the psalmist when he said: “O Jehovah,... with you is the source of life”? (Ps. 36:5,9) How can we in turn help others appreciate and give honor to Jehovah as our Creator? By offering </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font7"> during June. This book is truly outstanding in that it provides solid evidence of God’s existence and clearly shows why evolution cannot be true. It also builds up trust in the Bible as God's Word. Surely we want everyone to know how creation, not evolution, brings honor to Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Here is a simple, direct presentation. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">After greeting the householder, display the picture on page 6, and ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">■ &quot;Howdidlifegetstartedonthisearth? Some say it was all by accident. The Bible gives all the credit to God. What do you think? [Allow for response.] This book provides answers that are in full harmony with the Bible and scientific facts. I’d like you to have it so that you can review all the evidence and decide for yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup>After introducing yourself, you might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “In this modem scientific world, is it practical to believe in creation, or do you think we got here by chance? [Allow for response.] Notice the Bible’s reasoning on this matter. (Read Hebrews 3:4.] Would you not agree that every building has a builder? So, could the universe have come into existence by itself?” Show the Illustration on page 114 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> book, and then call attention to the thought expressed in paragraph 2 on page 115. If the householder shows interest and takes the book, tell him that the next time you call you will discuss the question, What is the future of man and the earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* Or after greeting the householder, you could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “What do you think our first ancestors looked like? [Allow for response.] Did they look like this ‘ape-man’? [Open to page 83 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> book.] Notice what the Bible states at Acts 17:26. [Read.] So, on what are drawings of ‘ape-men’ based?&quot; Draw attention to the caption under the drawing on page 89. Tell the householder that he can benefit from reading the book and learning the answer to this question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>&amp;</sup> Another approach might be to point to the cover of the “Creation” book and say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “Today we’re asking our neighbors, Did man get here by evolution or by creation? What do you think? [Allow for response.] Although many highly educated people accept evolution as a fact, other highly educated ones do not believe it. Notice the conclusion drawn by a former astronaut. [Highlight points on pages 122-3.] We must personally examine the evidence to see which we should believe—evolution or creation.” If the householder accepts the book, raise a question that can be answered on your next call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Do you yearn to help others learn the marvelous truths about our Creator and his loving purpose toward his creation? The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> book can help you do that. It honors our Grand Creator, the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, by extolling his works and making known his marvelous purpose to sanctify his name and to bless mankind through Christ’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Building Faith in Mankind’s Creator</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Most people have come to some kind of conclusion about the origin of life. Sad to say, many have been wrongly influenced to accept evolution as the answer. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> book takes an in-depth look at both sides of the issue and offers overwhelming proof in support of the Bible. How can we help sincere people who have displayed a willingness to listen? By making return visits. When we return, it is always good to have something definite in mind to say that will build faith in Jehovah as our Creator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> If the person manifested belief in the Bible, this approach might be effective for starting your conversation:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">■ “Isaiah 45:18 makes a powerful statement about the origin of the universe; I’d like to know what you think about it. [Read and allow for comment.] Jehovah identifies himself as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. What about </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">life </span><span class="font7">on this earth? Isaiah 42:5 gives him all the credit for that too. [Read.] If what the Bible says is true, evolution must be false. Do you feel you can trust the Bible?” Refer to chapter 17 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> book, and point out further reasons for believing in Jehovah as the Creator.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> You could begin your conversation with something like this: </span><span class="font7">■ “On my last visit, the question was raised. What is the future of man and the earth? Notice how the book I left with you answers that question.” Turn to pages 234-5 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> book and encourage him to read paragraphs 6 and 7. If further interest is shown, you might ask: “What dramatic changes, do you think, will take place on the earth?&quot; If appropriate, this point can be discussed at that time or on your next visit by continuing into other paragraphs in this same chapter of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If the householder appeared somewhat religiously inclined, you might ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">■ “Have you noticed that many people today give credit to an impersonal nature or a personification called Mother Nature? [Allow for comment.] The Bible does not leave us in the dark as to the real Creator.” Read Revelation 4:11. After the scripture is read, the householder may express himself. You can then call attention to a specific point or two from chapter 11 of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> book and perhaps highlight the Creator’s purpose to make all the earth into a paradise under Christ’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Another way you could begin the return visit is by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">■ “Mankind has suffered much pain and sorrow because of evil and wickedness. Jehovah, the Creator of this earth, has promised that these conditions will come to an end. [Turn to page 196, and read Proverbs 2:21, 22.] Those who recognize him as their Maker and do his will can look forward to marvelous blessings.” If appropriate at the time, continue with a discussion of Revelation 21:4,5 on pages 197-8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Experienced publishers have come to know that it is best to schedule set times for return visits. Having definite arrangements for this work will help us to follow up interest promptly. Determine the time that is best for you and for the people living in the territory. By your sharing regularly in this work, you will find joy in fulfilling the commission to “make disciples.”—Matt. 28:19,20.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Working Frequently Covered Territory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We rejoice to receive reports that many congregations are working their territory frequently. (Matt. 24:14; 1 Tim. 2:3, 4) Although this presents a unique challenge, experience has shown that it can be successfully met if we are well prepared and equipped to deal with various circumstances that arise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Effective Introductions Are the Key: </span><span class="font11">It is very important to be prepared to use one or more well-thought-out introductions. They should include pointed statements that make clear the vital reasons for our frequent calls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book supplies many fine examples of appropriate introductions to use. Three are listed on page 15 under the heading “In Territory Often Worked.&quot; Rehearse the ones you would like to use in your territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Some publishers find success using items from the local newspaper to initiate conversations in frequently worked territory. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book gives three examples of how this can be done. Consider the second introduction under the heading “Crime/Safety&quot; on page 10 and the first two introductions under the heading “Current Events” on pages 10 and 11.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Introductions You Prepare: </span><span class="font11">Feel free to develop and use appropriate introductory comments patterned after those presented in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book. Express these in your own natural way, using your own words. You could rehearse them with an experienced publisher before using them in the field.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> For example, you might say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Since we visited you last, [mention recent occurrence people in community are talking about). Because all of us are affected in one way or another, many of our neighbors have expressed serious concern. Perhaps you too have given it some thought. [Pause briefly to allow for possible response.) In view of world conditions today, would you not agree with what the prophet Jeremiah wrote at chapter 10, verse 23?&quot; After reading the scripture, get the householder's observations, then direct attention to a specific scripture that shows how Jehovah will resolve the particular problem under discussion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup> Or you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “No doubt you noticed in the news today [mention specific happening). Perhaps you will agree that this affects all of us. [Pause briefly for possible response.) We can hope for the authorities to come up with a short-term remedy; however, the Bible shows how the problem will be resolved permanently.&quot; Direct attention to a specific scripture that explains what God will do.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> “Why Do You Call So Frequently?” </span><span class="font11">Appropriate responses to this potential conversation stopper are given in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book on page 20 under the heading “Why Do You People Call So Often?&quot; Even without being asked, we can give a fine witness if we seize every appropriate occasion to help others appreciate that genuine love of God and neighbor motivates us to call as often as possible. A discussion of Jesus’ words at John 21:15-17 could prove to be very beneficial in this regard.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Until Jehovah says it is enough, let us continue to meet the challenge of working frequently covered territory. With this determination, we can be assured of his guidance, protection, and blessing right down to the end.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Meeting Attendance</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">—A Serious Responsibility</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> How seriously do you take meeting attendance? That is a searching question, is it not? No doubt most of us feel that we appreciate the meetings. However, reports indicate that meeting attendance in many congregations has recently declined. What could be the cause? Are some of us allowing unnecessary secular work, tiredness, homework, a slight physical indisposition, dr a little bad weather toEterfere with our obligation to attend meetings regularly? (Deut. 31:12) Since this is a Scriptural requirement, every one of us should give prayerful consideration to the question, How seriously do </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font11"> take meeting attendance?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Some of our brothers walk for hours along dusty roads and cross crocodile-infested rivers in order to attend meetings. In your own congregation, there may be faithful ones who are “never missing” despite severe health problems, physical disabilities, crushing work loads at their place of employment, or demanding assignments at school.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">(Luke 2:37) Why do they make the effort to attend? Because they know that they cannot meet the challenges of this pressure-filled world in their own strength. They must rely on the strength that God provides.—2 Cor. 12:9,10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Today we follow the pattern set by the early Christians, who met regularly to pray, share experiences, and study God’s Word. (Acts 4:23-30; 11:4-18; Col. 4:16) We receive instruction on Bible prophecy and doctrine, as well as on godly conduct and Christian morals, along with timely admonition on improving our lives now by careful application of Scriptural principles. (1 Tim. 4:8) In addition, we are reminded of our hope that one day there will be an end to problems and suffering. It is vital that this hope be kept alive.—Heb. 6:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> How seriously does your family take meeting attendance? Is it as much a part of your schedule as mealtime or secular work? On meeting nights, do you find yourself debating whether to attend or not, or is regular association with your brothers not optional in your household? Many publishers remember the example of their dedicated parents when they were growing up. “One thing about Dad,&quot; an elder fondly recalls, “was that he always made sure the family got to the meetings. If someone was sick, one of us would stay home with him, but the rest went to the meetingf</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> In succeeding issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> we will discuss the value of each congregation meeting with a view to helping build appreciation for these spiritual provisions. If yqurmeeting attendance could be more consistent, we are sure that the articles will help you to realize what you are missing. They will include helpful reminders for those who conduct the meetings, as well as suggestions all of us can apply when preparing for and participating in them. Why not sit down as a family and give prayerful consideration to your pattern of meeting attendance? Then make any necessary acUustments in your schedule. Regular meeting attendance is a vital part of our theocratic education and should be taken very seriously indeed.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1994 “Godly Fear” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Heartfelt expressions of appreciation for the spiritually refreshing program were heard from many of the 1,411,812 who attended the 1993 “Divine Teaching” District Conventions in the United States branch territory. New ones who were baptized as a result of their paying attention to the divine teaching found in the Bible totaled 13,920. Our having enjoyed such an upbuilding program last year should truly motivate us to make every effort to attend the stimulating program being arranged for the 1994 “Godly Fear” District Conventions next summer. With so many problems facing mankind today, surely all of us will invite and try to arrange for our Bible students to be there with us. It will prove to be a real source of encouragement and strength as we continue serving Jehovah with godly fear in spite of any obstacles that may present themselves in the days ahead.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Be sure to make your co</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nvention ar</span><span class="font13">rangements carefully and prayerfully so that you can be there to enjoy all three days of the delightful spiritual program, from the opening song to the closing prayer. Lovingly include in your plans those who may need assistance, especially newly interested ones, so that they also can attend every session. It would be very helpful to consider the information in this insert with any Bible students who may plan to attend. (Gal. 6:10) The program starts with music at 10:20 a.m. on Friday and ends at approximately 5:00 p.m. On Saturday the program begins at 9:30 a.m. and closes with song and prayer at approximately 5:00 p.m. The Sunday morning session begins at 9:30, and the day’s program concludes at approximately 4:15 p.m. The following information will assist you with your preliminary preparations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Instructions for Obtaining Rooms: </span><span class="font13">After the Service Meeting for the week of January 3, congregations should post on the information board the Recommended Lodging Locations list for the district convention to which the congregation is assigned. This list gives all the motels presently cooperating with the Society’s rooming arrangements. Your cooperation with these arrangements will assist the convention organization in its efforts to provide sufficient rooming accommodations for everyone at reasonable prices.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> What You Should Do: </span><span class="font13">After—NOT before—your congregation posts the Recommended Lodging Locations list containing the addresses, phone numbers, and agreed-upon rates of the motels, you are free to phone the motel of your choice from the list and make reservations. Identifying </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">yourse</span><span class="font13">lf as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower convention will qualify you for the rates listed, which in most cases are greatly reduced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> One night’s DEPOSIT IS REQUIRED to hold the room. Your deposit should be sent directly to the motel AS SOON AS you make reservations. If your deposit is not received by the motel, your reservations can be canceled at any time. MOTELS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO HOLD ROOMS WITHOUT A DEPOSIT. If you must cancel your reservation, you should immediately notify the motel, making the room available for other delegates.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, JANUARY 1994</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> If the motel you call first is filled, call your next selection from the list and so on. Often, everyone calls the motels closest to the convention facility being used; therefore, you may find it beneficial to try some motels farther away. These often have quality rooms at lower rates. The convention Rooming Department will continue to provide the congregations with revised lists, deleting motels that have been filled and listing additional motels until everyone has a room. Thus, if all the motels on the list are filled, please wait patiently for the next list, and you will be able to obtain a room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Dormitories: </span><span class="font13">A few conventions use school dormitories in addition to motels in order to accommodate everyone. Usually congregations will receive information on these a month or so after receiving the first motel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Special Needs: </span><span class="font13">This provision is only for exemplary publishers, including their well-behaved children, who are approved by the Congregation Service Committee. Arrangements to care for persons with special needs should be made by the congregation where they attend rather than have this obligation put on the convention organization. Elders and o</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ther</span><span class="font13">s who are aware of the individual circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often requires that publishers consider the needs of those in full-time service, the elderly, the infirm, and perhaps others. Publishers may extend help by taking such ones with them or caring for their needs in other ways.—Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Of course, the Rooming Department will endeavor to provide suitable rooming accommodations for publishers with special needs if they cannot be assisted by those in the congregation. These publishers may discuss their situation with the congregation secretary. The secretary should speak with the Congregation Service Committee to see if it is possible for the congregation to assist these individuals to care for their own rooming accommodations. If the congregation is unable to render the needed assistance, the secretary may give such persons a copy of the Special Needs Room Request form. Only those with special needs should fill out this form. It is to be filled out by the person making the request. It should be returned to the secretary, who will check it for completeness, accuracy, and verification of the circumstances that qualify the person for such consideration. The circumstances are to be EXPLAINED IN DETAIL by the secretary in the space provided on the form. All of this should be done well ahead of the convention. The secretary will then forward the form to the Rooming Department. The individual making the request will be notified directly about the accommodations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> Those with special needs should NOT go to the convention and request a room when they arrive, because the Rooming Department must have the verification of the Congregation Service Committee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> Private-home accommodations are set aside for those who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who can afford motel rooms but who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money. Furthermore, it is not proper for those making such requests to presume upon the hospitality of brothers by expecting to be accommodated extra days before or after the convention. These rooms are provided for the convention period ONLY. Those receiving such accommodations should make sure that they and their children act respectfully toward the home of their host; they should not rummage through or damage the host’s possessions or enter private areas of the home. If householders experience any difficulties along this line, these should immediately be brought to the attention of the rooming overseer at the convention, and he will be happy to help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Delegates Attending From Outside the Assigned Area: </span><span class="font13">In nearly every case, the location assigned for you to attend is the one nearest your congregation. Having adequate seating, literature, food, rooming accommodations, and so forth is based on the premise that the maj</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ority of publishe</span><span class="font13">rs will attend the convention to which th</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">eir congrega</span><span class="font13">tion is assigned. However, if for good reason you will be attending a convention other than the one assigned and need accommodations, the congregation secretary can give_yp.u the address for that convention headquarters from the list on the back of the Special Needs Room Request form. Then you can request in writing a copy of the motel listing for that location, sending along a stamped, self-addressed envelope. Upon receipt of this list, use it to make your reservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Your Cooperation Needed: </span><span class="font13">The success of this rooming arrangement depends on the cooperation of all of those involved. (Heb. 13:17) Thus, we are asking everyone to cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement and USE ONLY THE MOTELS ON THE RECOMMENDED LODGING LOCATIONS LIST FOR THIS YEAR so that major difficulties we still experience in negotiating with the motels can be prevented. We have made contracts with the hotels on the list stating that our people will be using them. It is a guarantee that they will get the business if they make special rates for us. Most publishers are taking to heart the clear direction that has been given in previous convention inserts, and many good results are being experienced. However, it is still necessary to request that everyone PLEASE OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING MOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">(a) Do not locate and call motels in the convention city and ask them if they are on the current list or have special Watchtower rates for the convention. Also, please do not use the same motel year after year without first checking to see that it is definitely on the current list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(b) Do not accept a higher price for a motel room than what is quoted on the current list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(c) Please do not make reservations at a motel you do not in</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">tend to use</span><span class="font13"> or at more than one motel with the idea of checking them, selecting the best, and canceling the others. (Matt. 5:37) This is unfair, as it prevents the motels from getting business they could have had and deprives other publishers of the use of those rooms, which are often vitally needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(d) Do not reserve rooms for yourself or others without giving names and immediately sending the deposit for each room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">(e) Do not put more people in the room than the law and the management allow, which is normally no more than four or five persons, including children. Remember, you are paying a rate based on the number of persons you AGREED would be in the room.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>14</sup> Violations in these areas make it difficult to negotiate good rates, and they bring reproach on Jehovah’s name and organization. (Compare Psalm 119:168.) Therefore, the Society will be asking the Rooming Department to check with the motels to determine if any are experiencing such problems and who is involved. On the other hand, IF YOU EXPERIENCE A PROBLEM WITH A MOTEL, please do not hesitate to bring it to the attention of the Rooming Department overseer at the convention so that he can assist you in resolving the matter right away.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>15</sup> The convention organization is working hard to save our brothers as much expense as possible, so it is in the best interests of all to cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement so that this provision can continue. The listing gives a choice of goodquality accommodations at motels that cooperate. With this arrangement, our aim is to help delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible so that they can enjoy the fine spiritual program at the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> Sign Language Conventions: </span><span class="font13">A major adjustment appears in the 1994 District Convention Locations list in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> of February 15,1994, showing that for the first time ever, there will be a complete American Sign Language district convention. There will be not just one but two complete signlanguage conventions. The program parts will not be interpreted but will be given in American Sign Language by qualified brothers. This means that the entire convention program will be conveyed directly to those in attendance, who will also be able to enjoy very upbuilding fellowship with much larger groups. In view of this, NO PROVISION for any type of sign language will be made at any other conventions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>17</sup> With such a significant change being made for the deaf field, it is important that all deaf individuals IMMEDIATELY begin making plans to attend one of these two sign-language district conventions. The elders should diligently check with each deaf person in their congregation to be sure that these know about this arrangement and to determine whether any assistance is needed so they can attend.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">[Note to Body of Elders: Please read the Society’s December 15, 1993, convention assignment letter and the first and last paragraphs of the Recommended Lodging Locations list for your congregation during the Service Meeting for the week of January 3. After that meeting, post the letter and the list on the information board. Elders are NOT to change their service meeting to an earlier night for this week. NO ONE, INCLUDING THE ELDERS, SHOULD MAKE MOTEL RESERVATIONS BEFORE THIS SERVICE MEETING. In this way all congregations will receive the information the same week. To the extent possible, the congregation secretary should handle convention-related material and announcements on future Service Meetings unless otherwise specified or he is unable to do so.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Bible—Mankind's Oldest Modern Book</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Bible is the most widely circulated book in all history. No other book has been translated into so many languages. In addition, no group of people have been as zealous as Jehovah’s Witnesses in distributing the Bible and publicly presenting it as the Word of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">* Since it is God's Word, we can be confident that it gives workable answers to modern-day problems. And Jehovah's organization provides practical help to find such answers in publications as well as videos. Therefore we are pleased to announce that the English version of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible —Mankind’s Oldest Modern Book,</span><span class="font11"> the second of three videos demonstrating the Inspiration of the Bible, may now be ordered from your congregation. It is 40 minutes in length.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Like the first video in this series, this second one also builds confidence in the Bible as a divine guide. It uses footage taken in Bible lands and in museums around the world to help us realize how Jehovah God has preserved the Bible throughout the centuries down to our day. You will see Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. The Memorial should not start so late that newly interested persons find it inconvenient to attend. Further, the schedule should not be so tight that there is no time before or after the celebration to greet visitors, make arrangements for continued spiritual assistance for some, or for a general interchange of encouragement among all present. After thoroughly considering all factors, the elders should determine what arrangements will best help all who attend the Memorial to benefit fully from the occasion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ Starting in February, and no later than March 6, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Human Creation’s Groaning—When Will It End?” ■ The special public talk for the 1994 Memorial season will be given worldwide on Sunday, April 10. The subject of the talk will be “True Religion Meets the Needs of Human Society.” An outline will be provided. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer, a circuit assembly, or a special assembly day that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congrega-how the accuracy of the Bible has been maintained despite repeated copying and translation. You will see how this divine book has been preserved in the face of extreme opposition to its distribution. You will also see living testimonies of how the Bible has changed people’s lives for the better.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> This video will be invaluable for family Bible discussion and for many other practical purposes—just like the first one. We are sure that Jehovah will bless its use. Those who have not yet ordered it can do so immediately through the literature department in the congregation.

The person making the gift must receive the letter of substantiation before he can claim a deduction on his tax return. Canceled checks for contributions of $250 or more on a single date are no longer considered proof of the donation by tax authorities. The substantiation must also indicate whether the donor received any goods or services in connection with his contribution. Bodies of elders.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping Others Appreciate the Value of Our Publications</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “The word of God is alive and exerts power.&quot; (Heb. 4:12) Since our Biblebased publications help people benefit from the power of God's Word, we use them to stimulate interest in the Bible when witnessing informally or when calling from house to house.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> January’s literature offer is any 192-page book printed on paper that yellows or discolors or any published before 1980. If such books are available in your congregation, prepare your presentation of the Kingdom message so as to lead into a specific point in the book you are using. How can this be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How to Prepare: </span><span class="font11">To begin, select a statement in the book you are using that will likely appeal to honesthearted people in your territory. Next, think of a current event or a subject of general interest that you might be able to discuss briefly with the householder before calling his attention to the printed statement you have selected. Perhaps there is a cited or quoted scripture you could read, either from the Bible or directly from the book, to support your statements. If the person shows genuine interest, you may then wish to offer the book. At that time or later if more appropriate, explain briefly how this worldwide preaching work is financed, and give the person opportunity to contribute if he so desires. In any case, try to leave him with a question or a thought that you can use as the basis for a return visit.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">* Many congregations have on hand a few copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Your Youth—Getting the Best Out Of It</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Listening to the Great Teacher. If</span><span class="font11"> these books are available. why not prepare for conversations with the young people you meet in the territory? Encourage them to read one of these fine publications. If offering </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, </span><span class="font11">you can use the formula outlined above and prepare to discuss any number of basic Bible doctrines that are covered in this excellent Bible study aid.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Offer </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mankind's Search for Gods </span><span class="font11">You may be able to start a conversation by calling attention to a news item that either highlights religious involvement in world affairs or otherwise shows religion's influence in the lives of people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Then pose a question, such as this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ “How do you think God views the religious systems that are influencing world affairs today? [Allow for answer.] Would it surprise you to learn that the basic teachings of all these religions are quite similar and that they stand in sharp contrast with the teachings of the Bible?” If the householder is willing to listen, show him the table of contents, and explain briefly that whether a person is religious or not, his life is being affected by powerful religious influences. Point out that he can benefit from learning why mankind's search for God has led in so many directions and away from learning how to identify the right religion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> At times it may be more appropriate to offer magazines or a tract. We have every reason to be enthusiastic and zealous about encouraging others to read these publications so that they can be equipped to experience the power of God's Word in their lives by responding to its direction.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Returning to Build Appreciation</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Meaningful return ..visits progressively stimulate and enhance a householder's growth toward becoming a believer. What are some pra</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ctical su</span><span class="font11">ggestions to keep in mind when calling back on those who have shown interest?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> First of all, prepare well. This begins on the initial call. How so? By keeping accurate records of interest shown. Note the name of the householder, the subject discussed, the response. and any placements made. Then review your house-to-house record before you return, and give prayerful thought to what you will say.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Now you are ready. What can you say? If you left the householder with a question on the initial call, you can then build on that subject when you return. For example, if the initial call centered on the blessings of God’s Kingdom, you could raise the question “Why does God permit wickedness?&quot; </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When you return, after introducing yourself, you might say: </span><span class="font11">■ “When we last spoke, we discussed why a God of love pennits so much wickedness today. Have you given.fur-ther thought to that?” [Allow response.] Do you think God really cares about mankind? [Allow response.) Consider what the Bible says at John 3:16.” After reading the verse, you could draw attention to specific portions of chapter 8 in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">TheTruth Thal Leads to Eternal Life,</span><span class="font11"> which points out the reasons for God’s toleration of wickedness today.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">’ Another thought-provoking question you might leave on your initial call would be: “If God intended man to live forever, why do people growold and die?” When you return, you could show them the Bible’s answer to that question as found at Romans 5:12. After reading the scripture, refer to the first paragraph on page 35 of the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Js This Life All There Is?,</span><span class="font11"> which discusses the basic reason why man grows old and dies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">* If on your initial call you discussed ways to identify the true religion and left th</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">e book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Mankin</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">d’s Search for God,</span><span class="font11"> a good question on which you could base your return. visit might be: “Hqw did so many religions come about?” When returning, you could talk about specific points in chapter 2 of that book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> A word of caution. Be careful about the questions you ask when you return. Asking “Did you read the material I left?” or “Do you remember me?&quot; or “Do you remember what we talked about the last time I was here?&quot; tends to put the householder in an awkward position. Such questions usually do not produce good results. On the other hand, be friendly, flexible, and brief. These qualities will enhance the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ These and other approaches may be used to cultivate appreciation in the hearts of interested ones. Why not set a personal goal of making at least one return visifeach week? Put to use the practical suggestions presented above, and search out experienced publishers who will help you. Your joy will increase as you build on the initial interest by making effective return visits.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The January 1, 1994, issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> page 22, reminded us that our magazines publish “timely articles that have come to grips with the real needs of people.” We want to give these journals wide distribution. During the months of April and May, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> are the featured offer, as well as any brochure except the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font12"> brochure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The house-to-house work gives us our best opportunity to place these magazines. Effective Informal witnessing and return visits also result in regular placements. Doing street work and calling on business establishments in our territory are likewise productive ways to increase distribution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Subjects to Discuss: </span><span class="font12">The April 1 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> considers the subjects “A Better World—Just a Dream?” and “A Better World—At Handr This is certainly in keeping with the magazine’s objective to announce the Kingdom of God. The second article concludes by showing how an eternal paradise will become a reality under the rulership of Christ Jesus.—Luke 23:43.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> “Where Can You Find Trustworthy Guidance?” is the question discussed in the April 15 issue. The May Issues will explore this subject further in the articles “Is Religion Filling Your Needs?&quot; and “Why Read the Bible?” We should be able to start conversations readily with people who feel their life lacks meaning and purpose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Increasing Placements: </span><span class="font12">The January 1 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> offered four suggestions to increase placements. We were encouraged (1) to be magazine conscious. When we read them, we should give some thought to which articles might be most appealing to people in our territory. Also, if we regularly carry copies with us, we may be able to place them with coworkers, neighbors, teachers, schoolmates, or shoppers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> We were reminded (2) to keep our presentations simple. Pick out one interesting point, and put it in a few words. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">It you</span><span class="font12"> can get the magazine into the home, it can do the “talking” to the person you met or others in the household.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’Another need is (3) to be flexible. It is good to have different articles in mind to discuss—one for youths, another for men, and something else for women.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Finally, we need (4) to set a personal goal for placements. While the congregation cannot set a certain quota, we can individually set a goal for ourselves. This may give us more incentive to be enthusiastic in offering the magazines. If we place a standing order for magazines, we may be prompted to do more.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> We want others to know about God’s Kingdom. Let us take full advantage of the fine help the magazines provide in spreading the Kingdom message.—Matt. 10:7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The purpose of the Service Meeting is to motivate and equip us to share more fully in the preaching and disciple-making work. (2 Tim. 3:17) However, if we do not properly prepare for the meeting or we fail to apply what we learn, the benefits will be minimal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">’Preparation in advance will help you to absorb the instruction more fully. Review the publications that will be used, and bring them with you so that you can follow along and be able to participate. Be an attentive listener, and take notes for later use.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The presiding overseer reviews the scheduled meeting parts carefully. Capable. qualified elders and ministerial servants are assigned to prepare them. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(om</span><span class="font12"> p. 70) Congregations having few elders and ministerial servants may assign other qualified brothers to assist them, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(km</span><span class="font12"> 10/76, Question Box) Each speaker should prepare thoroughly, adhere closely to direction provided, and make sure that he does not go overtime.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The meeting usually begins with announcements. The brother assigned should contact the presiding overseer in advance to find out what matters need to be mentioned. These may include letters from the Society or reminders about service arrangements or monthly reports. We may learn that there are sick ones who need to be visited or hear details of congregation activities planned for the future?Pay close attention so that you will be informed and ready to do your share.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> When a meeting part calls for audience participation, prepare by reading over the material and looking up the scriptures. Think about how you plan to apply the suggestions and what kind of comments you can make to encourage others. You might illustrate the practical value of the instruction by relating a brief experience.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> When there is a demonstration, try to picture yourself in similar circumstances, and think about what you would say. Note the arguments used and the line of reasoning. Try to recall what you said the last'time you were in this type of situation, and consider how the points demonstrated can help you get better results in the future.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Participants in demonstrations and interviews should be well rehearsed in advance. Each one shoulcfkhow' what he is going to say and what he is supposed to do on the platform. Unrehearsed parts rarely motivate or encourage the audience. Some come prepared to rehearse their part at the conclusion of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> Study so that they can practice on the platform and let the brothers handling the microphones know what will be needed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">'The program will sometimes include a talk dealing with a specific congregation need or a timely </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">article. Listen closely, take the counsel to heart, and try to apply it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> We want to be “prepared for every good work.&quot; (2 Tim. 2:21) The Service Meeting is one of the provisions Jehovah makes to aid us in doing that. Faithful attendance and a sincere effort to use what we learn will surely help us so that we can “fully accomplish [our] ministry.”—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Cleanliness Honors God</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The Mosaic Law contained strict requirements to ensure cleanliness. They set Israel apart as a people who were required to keep themselves physically and spiritually clean. (Lev. 11:35, 36; 15:1-11; Isa. 52:11) This clean condition brought honor to God and contributed to the health of the nation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Today too, cleanliness is an identifying mark of Jehovah's people. But while this identifies Jehovah’s people as a group, is it true of each of us individually? The extent to which we are concerned about neatness and personal cleanliness reflects how much we appreciate Jehovah’s requirements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> What about the appearance of our home? Does it detract from the Kingdom message we bear? Is it possible that some may question our sincerity if we speak about transforming the earth into a paradise while our own home is unkempt and the yard is overgrown with uncut grass or weeds? If our home gives the appearance of being disorderly or there are disagreeable odors because of unsanitary habits, can it be said that we have developed the “patterns of cleanness that will fit in with the new world under God's Kingdom”?—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">am</span><span class="font12"> pp. 130-1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’ What about the car we use for field service? Is it reasonably clean, inside and out, so that its appearance does not detract from our work? What about our clothing, book bag, and personal grooming? Are they neat and presentable, giving no cause for offense? It is reasonable that we keep ourselves and our clothing clean by regular bathing and laundering—u&gt;89 6/1 pp. 16-19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> What if a brother has become careless so that his personal hygiene or surroundings have become a cause for reproach to the congregation? Perhaps he simply needs some loving assistance because of age or infirmity. If so, it would be a kindness to help him. Someone may have the problem and not even be aware of it; kind admonition may prompt him to correct the situation. Individuals who consistently set a poor example in this respect would not qualify for outstanding privileges ~in the congregation. Of course, elders should guard against imposing their own personal standards or preferences.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Newly interested persons are invited to enjoy spiritual feasts at our Kingdom Hall. Usually, we are eager to extend an invitation because the hall is so attractive and neat. It takes work, though, to keep it that way. Look around your hall. Are the chairs, floors, and walls clean? Are the rest rooms scrubbed regularly? When we become accustomed to looking at a soiled carpet or walls with peeling paint, we may soon view that as acceptable. However, strangers visiting for the first time may be left with an unfavorable Impression. We should do our best to maintain an appealing and attractive hall, doing our share when the time comes for cleaning or refurbishing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Without speaking a word, we can glorify God by our personal appearance and the neatness of our homes, automobiles, and Kingdom Halls. Our good example will not give any cause for stumbling but will bear testimony that our worship is clean and upright.—1 Cor. 10:31, 32; Jas. 1:27.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Serve Jehovah Without Distraction</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “Happy is the people whose </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">God is Jehovah</span><span class="font13">r (Ps. 144:15) Are these words of King David still true, even during these wicked days? (Eph. 5:16) Yes! Christians still And joy in serving Jehovah. Things are not always easy for us. Satan causes us difficulties during these “critical times,” yet we are not downhearted. (2 Tim. 3:1,2) The worsening conditions are further proof that the time is at hand for God’s Kingdom to sweep away this decaying old world and replace it with a clean new world. (2 Pet. 3:13) The darkness of this world does not dim or extinguish the flame of our happy hope: rather, our Kingdom hope shines ever more brilliantly. Areyou n</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ot g</span><span class="font13">lad to be serving Jehovah as an </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">illuminator</span><span class="font13"> in this dark world?—Phil. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> As individuals, we must constantly watch how we are serving Jehovah. Why? Because Satan is a great Distracter. One dictionary defines “distract” as “to turn aside,” “to draw or direct (as one’s attention) to a different object or in different directions at the same time,” and “to stir up or confuse with conflicting emotions or motives.” Since being hurled down to this earth, Satan has succeeded in “misleading” mankind. He uses many devices to turn man’s attention away from the true issues of our day. (Rev. 12:9) Though Jehovah’s Witnesses have exerted themselves in preaching the Kingdom for the past one hundred years, how many people appreciate the all-important issues of the sanctification of God’s name and the vindication of his sovereignty by means of God’s Kingdom? Relatively few. (1 John 5:19) If Satan can </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">distract billion</span><span class="font13">s of people on this earth, the ever-present d</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ange</span><span class="font13">r is that he can distract us or capture our attention , so that we abandon Jehovah’s service. Sadly, some of our brothers have been confused by Satan’s distractions. They have allowed their minds to be drawn in different directions. There are all sorts of distractions today. Consider just a few of them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Economic Problems and Love of Material Things: </span><span class="font13">In most countries of the earth, unemployment and the high cost of living cause anxieties. True, we must provide food, clothing, and shelter for ourselves and our families. But if we allow ourselves to become overly anxious about the necessities of life, these concerns will dominate our thinking. Our physical survival can become the most important thing in life rather than our giving support to the Kingdom issue. The apostle Paul gave counsel in this regard at Hebrews 13:5, 6. Jesus Christ assures us that those who seek first the Kingdom need not be anxious; Jehovah provides what we truly need. (Matt. 6:25-34) Pioneers and other full-time servants throughout the world can confirm that this is true.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Satan’s world promotes the love of material things. Acquiring more possessions or safeguarding them is the driving force in the lives of millions. Similar distractions existed in Jesus’ day. A rich young ruler asked Jesus what he needed to do to inherit everlasting life. Jesus answered: “If you want to be perfect [or, complete], go sell your belongings and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven, and come be my follower.” (Matt. 19:16-23) Apparently, his many material possessions distracted this young man from serving God whole-souled. His heart was turned toward his riches. Jesus knew that the young man would be benefited if he unburdened himself of these distractions. They prevented him from being complete in his devotion to God. What about you? Do you find yourself working longer hours secularly just to maintain the life-style to which you have become accustomed? Has this affected your service to Jehovah? Are your material possessions crowding out Kingdom interests? (Matt. 6:24) Can you si</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">mplify vour life</span><span class="font13"> to devote more time to spiritual interests?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Ordinary Affairs of Daily Life: </span><span class="font13">If we are not careful, we may become so engrossed in the ordinary affairs of life that we begin to neglect spiritual pursuits. Remember the people of No</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ah’s day</span><span class="font13">. They were so pr</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">eoccupie</span><span class="font13">d with social affairs, eating and drinking, marrying and getting their children married, that they took no pote of Noah’s warning message about the impending Deluge. Before they realized it, the Flood came and swept them all away. Distractions spelled destruction for them. Jesus said: “So the presence of the Son of man will be.” (Matt. 24:37-39) Indeed, most people today are too wrapped up in their own lives to pay attention to the warning message we bring to them. They show an appalling indifference to spiritual things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Is your life becoming so crowded with social activities that spiritual matters are getting less and less attention? On one occasion, Jesus was invited to be a guest in the home of Martha and Mary. Mary was intently listening to what he had to say. On the other hand, Martha “was distracted with attending to many duties.” Martha had undue concern about being a good hostess. She failed to appreciate the need to take time to listen to Jesus. He kindly pointed out to Martha that elaborate provisions were not necessary; more attention should be given to spiritual matters. Do you need to apply that counsel? (Luke 10:38-42) Jesus also warned that we must pay attention to ourselves so that we do not overeat and drink heavily, dulling our senses. At this critical hour of human history, we need to be fully alert—Luke 21:34-36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Pursuit of Pleasures: </span><span class="font13">One of the greatest distractions the Devil uses to draw attention away from the Kingdom issue is the pursuit of pleasure. Millions in Christendom have put pleasure in the place of God. They prefer being amused by some diversion rather than taking a serious interest in God’s Word. (2 Tim. 3:4) Of course, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">wholesome</span><span class="font13"> entertainment and recreation are not wrong in themselves. But spending excessive time each week on such things as television, movies, videos, sports, secular reading, or hobbies may permit a treacherous heart to develop and pull us away from Jehovah. (Jer. 17:9; Heb. 3:12) How can that happen? During Christian meetings, you may find that your mind wanders; you may even wish the meeting would end so that you can get back to the pursuit of pleasures. Soon, you could find yourself looking for reasons to stay home rather than attend meetings or engage in field service. Now is the time to determine explicitly if these pursuits have become distractions in your life. (Luke 8:14) Could not some of the precious hours consumed by entertainment be better used for spiritual development?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Time-Consuming Side Issues: </span><span class="font13">Some have got caught up in efforts to resolve common problems in modern society. Christians need to avoid becoming involved in the world’s endless debates over social issues or its futile struggles to correct injustices. (John 17:16) All of this is part of Satan’s design to divert attention from the Bible’s counsel and the fundamental fact that there is only one long-term solution—the Kingdom of God. If we have suffered a personal injury or injustice, we must guard against becoming vindictive or so emotionally distraught that we forget who we are—Witnesses of Jehovah. Above all, it is Jehovah who has been wronged, and it is his name that we must sanctify.—Isa. 43:10-12; Matt. 6:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> While everyone wants to maintain a measure of good health, paying undue attention to the seemingly endless theories and remedies offered can make one obsessed with health matters. There are ever so many who advocate a wide variety of diets, treatments, and therapies for physical and emotional problems, many of which are in conflict with one another. What a person does in matters of health is a personal decision, as long as there is no conflict with Bible principles. Let us always maintain our complete trust in God’s Kingdom as the true remedy for mankind’s ills—Isa. 33:24; Rev. 21:3,4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">if </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Become Steadfast, Unmovable: </span><span class="font13">As the end draws near, Satan will increase his efforts to distract you from your service to Jehovah. “Take your stand against him, solid in the faith.” (1 Pet. 5:9) How? You must nourish yourself with God’s thoughts. (Matt. 4:4) Do not let the distractions of the world rob you and your family of the time you need to meditate and to reflect quietly on God’s Word. At family meals, discuss upbuilding experiences and other spiritual matters together. Stick to a consistent schedule of personal study and preparation for the meetings.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> When anxieties threaten to unsettle your mind, throw your burden on Jehovah in prayer. Be assured that he cares for you. (1 Pet. 5:7) Let the peace of God guard your heart and mental powers. (Phil. 4:6, 7) Do not let distractions blur your spiritual vision. Keep Jehovah before you constantly, as did Jesus. (Acts 2:25) Keep your vision focused straight ahead on your goal, as Proverbs 4:25-27 encourages us: “As for your eyes, straight ahead they should look, yes, your own beaming eyes should gaze straight in front of you. Smooth out the course of your foot, and may all your own ways be firmly established. Do not incline to the right hand or to the left.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> Faithfully attend all meetings, and discipline yourself so that you pay attention to instruction from God’s Word. (Heb. 2:1; 10:24, 25) And rather than look for pleasures offered by this decadent world, make it your goal to maintain a productive ministry. This is what brings lasting joy and satisfaction. (1 Thess. 2:19, 20) Finally, do not let anything or anyone distract you from your sacred service. “Become steadfast, unmovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.”—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">■ “Id like to show you an interesting comment made in this article entitled ‘A Better World—Just a Dream?' It says: 'This world, our world, is certainly not an ideal place. . . . The list of present woes seems endless.' This situation makes it difficult to be optimistic about the future, doesn't it? Let me show you, however, what Psalm 37:11 says about the future.&quot; After reading the verse, ask the householder how he feels about this promise. If he responds favorably, turn to the article “A Better World—At Hand!,’’ page 4, and say. “A number of Scripture texts are cited, including the one we just read from Psalm 37:11. I believe you would enjoy reading these articles and looking up the references in your Bible. I’d be pleased to leave them with you.” If appropriate, mention that our work is supported by voluntary donations and that you would be willing to accept a small donation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">■ “There are so many problems in the world today, such as [mention something that currently concerns the community or a news headline].

<p><span class="font12">“If we are enthusiastic about our magazines, the best in the world, we will be anxious to place them with others so that they too can embrace the Kingdom hope and share in exalting Jehovah as the Sovereign Lord of the universe.—Ps. 83:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">‘Jesus encouraged his followers to work at making disciples. (Matt. 28:19) That means more than just placing literature: we want to help people progress spiritually. To do that we must return to provide further assistance for those who manifest interest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If the householder’s interest appears to be minimal or he does not have time to converse, you may decide simply to add his name to your magazine route:</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">■ &quot;Notice what page 3 tells us about the theme of the message Jesus preached when he was on earth.&quot; Then briefly discuss the information on page 3. Ask the householder what he thinks he needs to do to learn more. Then say: “It’s important that we appreciate why we need God’s Kingdom so much. I’d like to return and discuss why we must look to God’s government as our only hope.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">They Have Not Held Back From Witnessing</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Our name. Jehovah's Witnesses, identifies us and describes what we do. We bear witness to the excellencies of our God, Jehovah. (Isa. 43:10, 12) Each one must share in giving this witness if he is to become a member of the congregation. Witnessing is done primarily through our public ministry, which includes calling from house to house, doing street work, making return visits, and conducting Bible studies. All of us are rightly urged to reach out for a full share.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Some members of the congregation, however, are limited in how much they can do. Serious illness or infirmity may keep them confined. Opposing relatives may raise imposing barriers. A young person may be restricted by an unbelieving parent. Individuals living in Isolated areas without transportation may feel stymied. Natural shyness could cause timid ones to shrink back. Some publishers who find themselves in these or similar situations may feel that they are not measuring up as Christians because what they are able to do is much less than what others are doing and less than what they really want to do. There is no reason for them to belittle their own efforts. (Gal. 6:4) They can take comfort in knowing that Jehovah is pleased when they give their best in whatever situation they find themselves.—Luke 21:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Finding a Way to Sharei </span><span class="font7">Thousands of experiences have been related showing how individuals in difficult circumstances have not allowed obstacles to prevent them from witnessing. Using their initiative, they have devised a great variety of ways to do informal witnessing. Those confined at home have used the telephone to open a wide door for witnessing. Every visitor is viewed as a potential listener. Even though a wife with an opposing family might not be able to witness in the home, she takes advantage of opportunities to speak to neighbors or others she meets in her daily routine.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> A young person may be forbidden by an unbelieving parent to share in our public witnessing. Rather than accept that as an insurmountable obstacle, he may view his classmates and teachers as his personal “territory’’ and be able to give a fine witness and perhaps even conduct Bible studies. Many living in isolated localities have been able to share by writing letters. Those motivated by Christian zeal will always find some way to avoid becoming “inactive or unfruitful regarding the accurate knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.”—2 Pet. 1:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> When it comes to our share in the witness work, Jehovah has set a uniform standard for all, namely, that we should be “whole-souled.&quot; (Col. 3:23) Although the amount of time we spend and what we accomplish will vary, the underlying motivation is the same —genuine love that emanates from “a complete heart.” (1 Chron. 28:9; 1 Cor. 16:14) If we are giving our best, we will never have reason to feel that we are lacking in faith or are useless as members of the congregation because the amount we are able to do is small. Like Paul, we can truthfully say that we have ‘not held back from telling the things that are profitable nor from teaching publicly.’—Acts 20:20.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Expand Your Treasure of Kingdom Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Jesus likened the Kingdom hope to a priceless treasure. (Matt. 13:44-46) Are we like the men in Jesus’ illustrations who sold all their possessions to buy something of greater value? If so, we will give God’s Kingdom first priority, even though it may Involve inconvenience and self-denial.—Matt. 6: 19-22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Since our Kingdom service is a treasure, it should be our desire to expand it. What does our personal course in life show? Are we expanding our Kingdom activity? We can do so by sharing in various features of the ministry, including house-to-house work, making return visits, conducting Bible studies, and witnessing informally.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup>‘How Can I Expand My Share?’ </span><span class="font7">With the start of a new service year, it is good for each one to review his personal activity to see what he might do to increase the time spent in the field ministry and ask: ‘Can I arrange my affairs in order to enroll as an auxiliary pioneer from time to time or even on a continuous basis? With a few adjustments, could I enter the regular pioneer service?’ New pioneers who enroll by September 1 qualify to attend the Pioneer Service School next year.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Some publishers have set a personal goal to do more informal witnessing. Often this activity produces excellent fruitage. Others may feel a need to improve in making effective return visits or starting new Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> If we conclude that our ministry is limited in some way, what can we do to expand it? Those who have successfully met higher goals recommend that we first make a determination to put Kingdom interests first no matter what. (Matt. 6:33) Faith and full reliance on Jehovah are necessary. (2 Cor. 4:7) Seek his help through sincere and persistent prayer. (Luke 11:8,9) We can be confident that Jehovah will bless our genuine efforts to increase our share in his service.—1 John 5:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Talk to other brothers and sisters who have successfully expanded their ministry. Ask them how they were able to overcome obstacles without getting discouraged. Their personal experiences may be just what is needed to convince you that an expanded ministry is not unattainable.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">’ When you read articles in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font7">dealing with the field service, prayerfully consider how you can apply the suggestions to your ministry. Do the same when attending congregation meetings or assemblies. The suggestions offered in this article are based on a discussion that was part of the circuit assembly program for last year. It is the first of a series of articles designed to help us follow through on and apply the encouragement provided by that program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Jesus took his ministry very seriously, making it a primary concern. He declared: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me.&quot; (John 4:34) Do we feel the same way? If we do, surely we will find ways to expand our activity and share “good things” with others from our treasure store.—Matt. 12:35; Luke 6:45.</span></p>

There are enjoyable things to anticipate, but there are also a few matters that can cause apprehension. Many youths will be assigned to different instructors, enrolled in new courses, and put in close association with students who are strangers. Our young people want to be cooperative with school authorities and congenial with their fellow students, but they should keep in mind that they have to guard against anything that could be spiritually detrimental.—1 Cor. 15:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> A major concern for Witness children and youths is to avoid the contaminating influence of the world, which permeates educational systems in many lands today. Christians young and old must be courageous in rejecting the worldly standards and thinking that are now being promoted regarding moral Issues, and they must ‘keep on guard’ by consulting and being guided by Jehovah’s Word. (Ps. 119:9) Concerned parents need to be informed regarding what is Included in the school curriculum in order to give appropriate direction to their children. If what is taught in school or elsewhere conflicts with the holiness and chasteness required of Jehovah’s servants, it must be avoided. —1 Pet. 1:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> It is also quite common to encounter issues involving nationalistic ceremonies, holiday celebrations, sports activities, or social gatherings. The brochure </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">School and Jehovah's Witnesses </span><span class="font7">is helpful to Christian youths regarding these matters. Potentially difficult situations may be surmounted or minimized when parents of young children take the initiative in approaching teachers with a copy of this publication. They can explain that this will help the teacher understand why Jehovah’s Witnesses choose not to participate in certain activities. Making this information available to the teacher can do much toward creating a spirit of cooperation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Additionally, it would be good for Christian students to keep a personal copy of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font7"> brochure with their study material at school. Opportunities often arise for giving a witness to other students who ask questions when attention is focused on our beliefs. Also, Witness children should carry on their person at all times their Advance Medical Directive/Release card or Identity Card that is up-to-date, properly witnessed, and signed. Those who apply this admonition will surely be like the ‘shrewd one who has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal himself.’—Prov. 22:3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> When we call at their homes, we usually And that people are engrossed in “the anxieties of this system of things.” (Mark 4:19) We are confronted with the challenge of capturing their interest with a thought-provoking presentation. Initially, most people may have little interest in what we have to say. If we can say something that will touch their lives, we may be able to stir some interest in the Kingdom message. A key to starting conversations is to select appealing talking points from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book. What could you say?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> You might use this approach: </span><span class="font7">■ “If you had the power, what distressing problem in our day would you correct? (Allow for response, and if appropriate, agree that many people feel the same way.) Up to this point, world leaders seem to have little success in finding solutions to many perplexing problems of the day. But there is One who can and will bring an end to all the problems afflicting mankind. Please note what is stated at Psalm 145:16. (Read the scripture, and refer to the illustrations on pages 11-13.| Paragraph 14 on page 14 raises the question we just discussed and goes on to ask: ‘But when will this occur?' ” Explain that the book will answer that question, and if there is interest, offer the book. ■</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Or you could say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">■ “Perhaps you know the empty feeling that comes with losing a loved one in death. Likely it made you feel sad and very helpless. You may have pondered these questions: [Read questions in paragraph 1 on page 76.) Wouldn’t it be comforting to have the answers to these questions? It may encourage you to know that the Bible holds out a sure hope for those who have died. [Read John 5:28,29.] This book helps us to understand the condition of the dead and what hope there is for the future.&quot; Briefly refer to chapters 8 and 20. If there seems to be interest, give the householder an opportunity to examine the book.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> There is a good possibility that you will encounter opportunities to witness informally. If so, you might say in your own words something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">■ “The world is full of problems these days, and no doubt you have your share of them. Sad to say, it seems that the innocent ones suffer the most. Do you think God will ever put an end to all suffering? (Allow for response.] Let me point out what God promises to do for those who serve him. [Read Psalm 37:40, and then open the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book to page 99.] This book explains why God has permitted wickedness and how he will bring it to an end.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> If you are a younger publisher, you could use a presentation based on the illustrations found on pages 156-8. You might start by asking:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">■ “Would you like to live in a world like this? (Allow for response.] Each one of these beautiful pictures is based on a promise stated in God’s Word, the Bible. [Point to Scripture references.] This book can help you learn more about God’s promise to make the whole earth into a paradise. It contains lifesaving information and is well worth the time it takes to read it.”—John 17:3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> When offering the book, be mindful of the need to make your listeners aware of their opportunity to contribute toward the worldwide work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">With the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Love for people should move us to be prompt in returning to help those who are hungering and thirsting for the truth. (Matt. 5:6) We should take note of and cultivate any spark of interest we may find if we do not want it to die out. Preparation is the key to success.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Our goal should be to start Bible studies. (Matt. 28:20) The initial printing of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font7"> book included these introductory comments: “This is indeed an excellent book to use in studying with everyone, young or old, no matter what their standard of education.&quot; It is written in a way that makes conducting studies easier, enabling even newer publishers to have a share. Our success in starting new studies depends upon our effectiveness in making return visits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How Can We Start Studies? </span><span class="font7">When we return, it is usually good to tie in our discussion with some point or question mentioned on our initial visit. Perhaps you discussed the condition of the dead, leaving the question, “What hope is there for our dead loved ones?” Explain that the resurrection is not an unfounded hope; the Bible records numerous examples of resurrections that have already taken place. Review illustrations on pages 167-9. Then discuss what is stated in paragraphs 1 and 2 on page 166. If there is interest, offer to return to further the discussion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> You may have spoken to a parent who expressed concern about the increasing problems experienced in raising children. You might, in your own words, say something like this: </span><span class="font7">■ “AU parents want the best for their children. The Bible contains instruction that can help parents to train their children to find a satisfying Ufe that has meaning and purpose. For that reason, we strongly recommend that families study the Bible together. [Refer to paragraph 23 on page 246.] The knowledge gained can bring everlasting blessings to the entire family.” Read John 17:3. Express your willingness to return to show the famUy how to get their study started.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> If you are a young or a newer publisher and you spoke briefly about the Paradise hope on the first call, with the book open to page 3, simply express something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">■ “The Bible promises that those who do God’s will can look forward to living in a world like this, where there will be happiness and peace. This book shows what we have to do to enjoy that blessing.&quot; Briefly explain our study procedure, and offer to demonstrate it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> As Jesus’ disciples, we have an ob-Ugation to help people. (Rom. 10:14) If we placed literature or simply had a good conversation, we have a responsi-biUty to cultivate the interest. (Matt. 9:37, 38) If we fulfifl this assignment properly, aU can share the blessings that result.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>

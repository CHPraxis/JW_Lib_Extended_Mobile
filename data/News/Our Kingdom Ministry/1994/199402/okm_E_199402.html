<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Hail Jehovah’s Firstborn!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> On Sunday. Nisan 9, 33 C.E., a great crowd with palm branches in their hands hailed Jehovah's firstborn Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, as “the One coming as the King in Jehovah’s namer (Luke 19:38; Heb. 1:6) On Monday and Tuesday, Nisan 10 and 11, Jesus was intensely occupied with his public ministry, making those final days among the busiest of his earthly life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Today, an even greater crowd with figurative palm branches In hand cry out with a loud voice: “Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.&quot; (Rev. 7:9,10) On March 26, we will meet to celebrate the Memorial of Christ’s death. As that date approaches, can we intensify our efforts in the ministry and thus add to this global shout of praise?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Increase Field Activity: </span><span class="font10">Many publishers have already enrolled as auxiliary pioneers during March. Would you like to join them? If so, turn in your application without delay. One of the elders will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">* Whether you can serve as an auxiliary pioneer or not, you will want to have a full share in the ministry during March. The congregation may be able to arrange for group witnessing every day during the month. Sufficient territory should be set aside for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> All congregations should arrange for a special meeting for field service for Saturday. March 26. Although there is much to do in preparation for the Memorial, it is recommended that everyone who is able to do so engage in the field ministry on Saturday morning. In addition to working from house to house, be sure that those you have invited to attend the Memorial have transportation and that they have the time and place of the meeting clearly in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Invite and Encourage Others: </span><span class="font10">Jesus commanded his followers: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (1 Cor. 11:24) As Jesus’ anointed footstep followers obey that command, every servant of Jehovah is invited to attend and observe the Memorial celebration. Among others, you should invite Bible students, relatives, those with whom you have had Bible discussions, unbelieving mates, and business acquaintances. Make a list so that no one is overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> There will be additional opportunities for encouraging interested people at the Memorial itself. Be sure to arrive early so that you can greet new ones who are attending for the first time. If several of your Bible students attend, it may be practical for another publisher to sit with some of them during the meeting. Invite newcomers to attend the congregation’s regular Public Meeting. The elder selected to present the public talk should be well prepared to deliver a stimulating discourse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> At the conclusion of the Memorial celebration, as we join our voices in singing song 105, “Hail Jehovah’s Firstborn!,&quot; may we be able to look back with satisfaction on a zealous month of theocratic activity to Jehovah’s praise!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Fully Support Your Congregation’s Public Meeting Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Some years ago a young man found a handbill advertising the meetings of the local congregation. Since he was looking for the truth, he decided to attend the Public Meeting that very Sunday, arriving at the hall well in advance. A publisher warmly greeted him and. during the course of the conversation, offered him a Bible study, which he declined. However, he was so impressed by the well-prepared public talk that he changed his mind, and after the meeting he accepted the study. This young man made rapid progress and was baptized several months later. We can learn at least three helpful lessons from this experience.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> First, the Public Meeting had been </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">advertised.</span><span class="font10"> Do you use printed handbills to advertise your congregation’s meeting program? As the chairman announces the title of the public talk to be delivered the following week, think of those in your territory who may be especially interested in the subject, whether they are currently reading our literature or not. Some people do not like to read, or they read with great difficulty, but they may be willing to listen to a talk on a Scriptural topic.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Second, the newcomer was given a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">warm welcome.</span><span class="font10"> If you plan to arrive at the hall as early as possible, you can greet your brothers and sisters as well as any interested ones. (Heb. 10:24) If a newcomer is attending for the first time, he may not know what to expect. Explain that our meetings begin with song and prayer, and tell him how the meeting will be conducted. If appropriate, invite him to sit with you so that you can share your Bible and songbook with him. Invite him to discuss with you any questions he may have once the meeting has been concluded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Third, the talk was </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">well prepared. </span><span class="font10">Those who are privileged to represent the congregation as public speakers spend many hours preparing and rehearsing the material in order to incite the audience to greater love and fine works. All of us are under pressure today, and the refreshing truths from God’s Word are just what we need to help us endure. Of course, no matter how informative the public talk may be. it will be of little value to us personally unless we pay close attention to what is said. Do you occasionally have difficulty concentrating during the talk? It may be helpful to make brief notes, just as we often do during our conventions. Be sure to follow along in your Bible as each Scripture text is read and explained.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">‘The Society has provided public talks on a wide variety of Scriptural subjects. Working through the presiding overseer or a brother designated by him. the body of elders coordinates the congregation’s Public Meeting program. Subjects outlined by the Society are selected to address current local needs. Do not miss any of this vital information, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">fully</span><span class="font10"> support your congregation's weekly Public Meeting.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Question Box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">What procedure should be followed when presenting resolutions to the congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A resolution is required when a decision must be made about important matters such as purchasing property, remodeling or building a Kingdom Hall, sending special contributions to the Society, or caring for the circuit overseer’s expenses. It is usually best to present a resolution for approval each time congregation funds are dispensed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As an exception, the congregation might resolve once to contribute a specific amount each month to the Society in addition to what each individual is contributing toward the worldwide preaching work already. Also, normal Kingdom Hall operating expenses, such as utilities and cleaning supplies, do not require a resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When a need becomes evident, the body of elders should discuss the matter thoroughly. If the majority are counts report. Relate Society’s expressions of appreciation for donations sent, and commend congregation for loyal support of local congregation needs. Encourage participation in weekend field activity, and outline any special field service arrangements for holiday on February 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">“Stimulate Growth Through Meaningful Return Visits.&quot; Questlon-and-answer discussion. Have demonstration of return visit based on presentation in paragraph 3. Highlight need for discernment in not covering too much material during visit, and stress importance of Instilling Interest in future visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">is min: </span><span class="font10">“Objects of Hatred by All the Nations.” Talk by experienced elder. Song 122 and concluding prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Song 198</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 min: </span><span class="font10">Local announcements. Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">“Hail Jehovah’s Firstborn!” Question-and-answer coverage of article. Warm, enthusiastic presentation by elder, encouraging all to make list of individuals they will invite to attend Memorial and next regular public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">in agreement that something needs to be done, one of the elders, perhaps a member of the Congregation Service Committee, should prepare a written resolution for presentation at the Service Meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The elder acting as chairman should briefly but clearly explain the need that exists and what the body of elders recommends to care for it. The congregation is then given opportunity to ask pertinent questions. If the matter is complicated, it may be best to delay the vote until the next Service Meeting to give everyone time to think about it. The actual vote is taken by a show of hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Voting on the resolution is limited to dedicated and baptized members of the congregation unless legal requirements direct otherwise, as may be the case when corporation matters or Kingdom Hall loans are Involved. It would not be appropriate for visitors from other congregations to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After the resolution has been approved, it should be dated, signed, and placed In the congregation file.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Demonstrate points made in paragraph 7. Have publisher approach person who enters Kingdom Hall and looks around. Publisher learns that man was encouraged to attend by relative who lives in another city. Publisher Invites man to sit with him and his family so that they can share Bible and songbook. Publisher offers to answer any questions that man might have after the meeting. Conclude part by announcing time congregation will celebrate Memorial.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“Objects of Hatred by All the Nations”</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In recent years all of us have rejoiced to hear thrilling reports about marvelous blessings experienced by Jehovah’s people around the world. Legalization of the work in Malawi after 26 years of brutal oppression moved us to tears of joy. We heaved a sigh of relief when we witnessed the collapse of godless Communism in Eastern Europe that resulted in the freeing of literally thousands of our brothers from its oppressive yoke. We watched with anxious concern as our freedom of worship was challenged in Greece; we were elated when we won a resounding victory in the highest court in Europe. We have been delighted to hear reports about the large-scale expansion of the Society’s branches that has made possible the production of massive quantities of literature for truth seekers. We could not help but marvel when we learned that more than 7,400 were baptized at the convention in Kiev, Ukraine. Yes, these dramatic advances in the Kingdom work have lifted our spirits to new heights!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> While our cause for rejoicing is great, we have to guard against becoming overly elated. A series of favorable reports could cause us to conclude that opposition to the good news is crumbling and that Jehovah’s people are gaining acceptance around the world. Such thinking can be deceptive. While we have won some satisfying victories and achieved a measure of success in lowering barriers to the good news in some lands, we must not forget that our fundamental relationship with the world remains unchanged. As followers of Jesus, we are “no part of the world.” As such, we are sure to be “objects of hatred by all the nations.” (John 15:19; Matt. 24:9) As long as this system of things remains, nothing is going to change the basic rule that “all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.&quot; —2 Tim. 3:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The pages of history attest to the truthfulness of this warning. While Jesus, the Founder of Christianity, gave marvelous testimony before powerful rulers and their subjects, he suffered daily abuse and was in constant danger of being put to death. Even though his apostles helped many become disciples, shared in writing the Christian Greek Scriptures, and manifested miraculous gifts of the spirit, they were likewise hated and mistreated. In spite of their good conduct and love of neighbor, all Christians were viewed by the majority as a contemptible “sect” that was “spoken against everywhere.’ (Acts 28:22) While the worldwide Christian congregation today has been used by Jehovah in a marvelous way to accomplish his will, it has been continuously opposed and maligned by every element of this wicked system of things. There is no reason to expect that opposition to cease.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In the first century, Satan persecuted Jesus’ disciples in a variety of ways. Hateful opposers told outright lies that misrepresented them. (Acts 14:2) There were vicious threats in an attempt to intimidate them. (Acts 4:17, 18) Angry crowds tried to silence them. (Acts 19:29-34) They were imprisoned without just cause. (Acts 12:4, 5) Persecutors often resorted to physical violence. (Acts 14:19) In some cases innocent ones were deliberately murdered. (Acts 7:54-60) The apostle Paul personally endured virtually all these forms of abuse. (2 Cor. 11:23-27) Opposers were quick to exploit any opportunity to interfere with the preaching work and to inflict suffering on these faithful workers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Today Satan is using similar tactics. Outright lies have been told, falsely portraying us as a misguided sect or cult. In some lands, authorities have judged our literature to be disruptive and have banned it. Our respect for the sanctity of blood has been publicly ridiculed and challenged. In the 1940’s, angry mobs incensed over the flag-salute issue attacked our brothers, inflicted injuries, and destroyed their property. Thousands have been sent to prison over the neutrality issue. In totalitarian lands our brothers have been falsely accused of being subversive, resulting in hundreds being brutally tortured and killed in prisons and concentration camps. The pressure has been relentless, clearly showing that we are objects of hatred without just cause.—See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers,</span><span class="font11"> chapter 29.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> What Does the Future Hold? </span><span class="font11">While Jehovah’s people may achieve a breakthrough from time to time to relieve the pressure in some part of the world, the overall situation remains the same. The Devil continues to be angry over his debasement in 1914. He knows his time is short. His rage is sure to intensify as the great tribulation draws near. He is totally committed to his war against the enthroned King, Christ Jesus, and he is determined to fight to the finish. He and his demons can vent their anger only on Jehovah’s people here on earth, who faithfully “observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.”—Rev. 12: 12,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> So as we look to the future, we need to be realistic in what to expect. There is no reason to think that the Devil will back down or give up. The hatred of us that he has instilled in this world can flare up at any time and in any place. In many lands our freedom to preach has been secured only after a long struggle. That freedom may be very fragile, maintained only by some current sympathetic ruler or unpopular law. Dramatic upheavals can occur overnight, bringing chaos and wanton abuses of human rights.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> The present prosperity and freedom that we enjoy in some lands could end abruptly, subjecting our brothers to the same abuses they have suffered in the past. We dare not allow ourselves to be lulled into a spirit of apathy or indifference, thinking that our adversaries have been subdued. This world’s hatred may not always be fully manifested, but it remains intense. Everything in God’s Word shows that the world’s opposition will intensify rather than subside as the end approaches. So we have to be on guard, showing ourselves to be “cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves.” (Matt. 10:16) We should realize that we will have “a hard fight” right to the end, and endurance is the key to our survival.—Jude 3; Matt. 24:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> In the part of the world where we live, the work may be prospering without any noticeable hindrance by opposers. This could make us skeptical about there being any cause for serious concern. Nevertheless, there is a need to be vigilant. Circumstances can change quickly. Without warning, opposers can exploit some issue and use it against us. Apostates are constantly searching for some cause for complaint. Irate clergymen who feel threatened by our work may publicly denounce us. Our plans to construct a Kingdom Hall in our community may spark a controversy that upsets the whole neighborhood. Inflammatory statements may appear in print, casting us in a bad light. Prominent local figures may purposely misrepresent us, causing our neighbors to be hostile when we call. Even loved ones in our own household may become resentful and persecute us. So there is a need to be on guard, realizing that the enmity of the world is very much alive, and it can surface at any time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> How Should This Affect Us? </span><span class="font11">Afi of this rightly affects our thinking and our outlook for the future. In what way? Should this make us apprehensive, fearful about what we may have to endure? Should we slow down in our preaching work because some in our community may be disturbed by it? Is there a valid reason to feel agitated when we are unjustly maligned? Is it inevitable that harsh treatment will rob us of our joy in serving Jehovah? Is there any uncertainty about the outcome? No, never! Why not?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>11</sup> We must never lose sight of the fact that the message we proclaim originates, not with us, but with Jehovah. (Jer. 1:9) We are under obligation to heed the exhortation: “Call upon his name. Make known among the peoples his dealings... in all the earth.” (Isa. 12:4, 5) He has tolerated the mistreatment of his people for a specific purpose, namely, ‘to have his name declared in all the earth.’ (Ex. 9:16) We are doing a work decreed by Jehovah, and he is the one who gives us the courage to speak out with boldness. (Acts 4:29-31) This is the most important, beneficial, and urgent work that can be done in these final days of the old system.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>12</sup> This knowledge gives us the courage to take a firm stand in direct opposition to Satan and this world. (1 Pet. 5:8, 9) Knowing that Jehovah is with us makes us “courageous and strong,” dispelling any cause for fear before our persecutors. (Deut. 31:6; Heb. 13:6) While we will always try to be tactful, reasonable, and discreet when threatened by opposers, we will make it clear that we are determined to “obey God as ruler rather than men” when our worship is challenged. (Acts 5:29) When there is reasonable opportunity to speak out in our defense, we will do so. (1 Pet. 3:15) However, we will not waste our time disputing with hardened opponents who are only interested in discrediting us. Rather than become incensed or try to retaliate when they malign or falsely accuse us, we simply “let them be.” —Matt. 15:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>13</sup> Our endurance through trials is pleasing to Jehovah. (1 Pet. 2:19) What price must we pay for that approval? Must we resign ourselves to serving without joy because we are hated and opposed? Far from it! Jehovah promises to reward our obedience with “joy and peace.” (Rom. 15:13) In the face of intense suffering, Jesus remained happy because of “the joy that was set before him.” (Heb. 12:2) The same is true of us. Because the reward for our endurance is so great, we are moved to “rejoice and leap for joy” though we suffer grievous trials. (Matt. 5:11, 12) Even in times of adversity, this joy is, in itself, a cause for giving praise and honor to Jehovah in support of the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>14</sup> Is there any uncertainty about the final outcome, giving us reason to be apprehensive or indecisive? No, the outcome of the conflict between Jehovah’s organization and Satan’s world was decided a long time ago. (1 John 2:15-17) Regardless of the intensity or magnitude of the opposition, Jehovah will give us the victory. (Isa. 54:17; Rom. 8: 31, 37) Even though we are fully put to the test, nothing can prevent us from receiving the reward. We have no cause to “be anxious over anything,” because Jehovah has granted us peace in response to our supplications—Phil. 4:6,7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>15</sup> So we thank Jehovah every time we hear reports about our brothers being rescued from persecution or given freedom to preach in areas where they have been restricted in the past. We rejoice when changing circumstances open up new opportunities for thousands of sincere people to come in contact with the Kingdom message. We are truly grateful when Jehovah chooses to give us the victory in confrontations with hateful opposers. We know that he will bless and prosper our work in whatever way is necessary in order to exalt his house of true worship and give the “desirable” ones from all the nations an opportunity to enter.—Hag. 2:7; Isa. 2:2-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>16</sup> At the same time, we are fully aware that our enemy, Satan, is very powerful, and he is going to oppose us vigorously right down to the end. His attacks may be open and flagrant, or they may be subtle and deceptive. Persecution may erupt suddenly in places where we have known only peace in the past. Wicked opposers may be vicious and un-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The inspired writer of Psalm 48 urged those in Israel to ‘march around Zion, count its towers, inspect its dwelling towers, in order that they might recount it to the future generation.’ Moved by love for Jehovah, they would be keenly interested in every detail of that earthly center of theocratic rule. How precious these details would be because this was the city upon which Jehovah had placed his own name! They would talk about it, and especially were they to be sure that their offspring heard about all the things they had treasured up in their own hearts. —Ps. 48:12,13.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> We now live in the time when the theocratic rule of Jehovah’s Messiah is centered no longer in earthly Zion but in heavenly Jerusalem. (Heb. 12:22) Jehovah’s Kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ has been ruling since 1914. (Rev. 12:10) Its activity is of the greatest interest to us. We are also keenly interested in the way in which Jehovah has led his servants on earth so that they might accomplish his will as visible representatives of that Kingdom. Fascinating details concerning this are set out in our new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom.</span><span class="font11"> How delighted we were to receive it at our recent “Divine Teaching” District Convention!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> By September 1, the book had already 'been released in 20 languages, and translation and publication were under way to fill the needs of those speaking 13 other tongues. Has your household obtained a copy? Are you reading it? Are you talking about the things you learn from it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> After looking at the pictures and reading the captions, as suggested at the convention, many brothers and sisters quickly got into the meat of the material. What have been their comments? Here are just a few.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> A sister wrote: “It is the only book that I have ever received that I can’t wait to finish so I can read it relenting in efforts to oppress us unjustly. In due time it will become clear to all such ones that they are “fighters actually against God,” and he will annihilate them. (Acts 5:38, 39; 2 Thess. 1:6-9) In the meantime, regardless of what we must endure, we are determined to remain steadfast in loyally serving Jehovah and preaching the Kingdom message. We are the happiest people on the face of the earth, knowing that ‘on becoming approved we will receive the crown of life.’—Jas. 1:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">again. I am on chapter 25 now. The more I read, the more the tears come and my heart is filled with love for Jehovah. The book is so encouraging and faith strengthening.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> A brother who has been serving Jehovah for over 40 years said: “Little did I realize how absorbing this book would be. I stayed up late and rose early and completed the reading in two weeks. It truly is one of the most moving books I have ever read. It is a masterpiece of research but also a masterpiece of encouragement.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> A Regular Program of Reading: </span><span class="font11">Some who quickly read the entire book have determined to read it again but this time at a slower pace.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> If there is more than one member of your household in the truth, you may want to use portions of the book in your family study. Some families started to do that within a few days after they received a copy at the convention. This does not mean that other things, such as preparation for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> Study, should be set aside. But you may find it very beneficial to use another 15 or 20 minutes for reading and discussing material from the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaim-ers</span><span class="font11"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Other families are reading two or three pages —perhaps a subheading or two—each evening before leaving the supper table. Individually they may already have read most of the book, but they are benefiting from a slower coverage along with the opportunity to discuss the material. Some who are doing this have been serving Jehovah for many years. As they read, many fond memories are stirred up. It warms their hearts as they discuss together their own share in the events about which they read.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> Because of circumstances in your home, you may find that you do your reading alone. One sister who wrote to the Society said: “I have been reading this book a little at a time each night before going to bed. This book is building in me a deeper appreciation and love for the truth, and I feel closer to Jehovah and so thankful that I am a part of his organization. I am truly savoring each page I read.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>11</sup> Although the book is large, the individual sections are not. The opening section is a fast but fascinating coverage of events from the days of Abel down through the year 1992—in just 108 pages.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Other sections range from 13 to 150 pages. Each of these sections is divided into a number of chapters. Instead of rushing through them, take one section, one chapter, or one subheading at a time; enjoy it; and get the good from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup>Take Time to Think About What You Read: </span><span class="font11">What is going to be your objective as you read? Merely covering pages—completing the book— should not be your aim. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers</span><span class="font11"> book contains a record of your spiritual heritage. You ought to know it well. Take time to think about the implications of what you read. As you review the activity of ancient witnesses of Jehovah, consider how you can imitate their faith. (Heb. 12:1,2) When you read about the development of the great apostasy, take special note of the pitfalls that ensnared those who turned away, with a view to safeguarding your own spirituality. And as you review our modern-day history, observe the spiritual qualities of those who were used by God, how they demonstrated that the doing of God’s will was the most important thing in their lives, and how they reacted to situations—some of them very difficult—that God permitted.—Heb. 13:7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>13</sup> You will find it faith strengthening to explore details showing how Jehovah has led his people to the clear understanding of Bible truth that we now enjoy. Your appreciation of the visible arrangement that Jehovah is using will grow as you become better acquainted with the development of the organization. You will surely feel excitement as you read how, in fulfillment of prophecy, the good news has reached the most distant part of the earth. Your heart will be warmed by the experiences of faithful ones in all parts of the world who have worked zealously to proclaim the Kingdom. You will be fortified to deal with personal trials as you read what faithful brothers and sisters have already endured because of their love for Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>14</sup> After you have read a portion of material, take time to discuss together its value and to review the details. If you have young children, get them involved in explaining the pictures and telling you what they know about the people shown. Even if you are reading alone, endeavor to share with others what you are learning. As appropriate, use the material on return visits and when conducting home Bible studies. Your repeating it will impress it on your own mind and heart, and it will benefit others too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> Take an Interest in the Details: </span><span class="font11">The periods that you devote to reading the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers</span><span class="font11"> book should be both enjoyable and profitable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>16</sup> Would you like your family to visit the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Pages 208-9 show the facilities used by the Society a century ago in the Pittsburgh area. Pages 216-17 acquaint you with buildings used later in Brooklyn. The pictures on pages 352-6 can help you to visualize the world headquarters today. Chapters 26 and 27 fill in details about the work done at Bethel, and pages 295-8 give further information about Bethel life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>17</sup> Most of us are not able to visit many of the Society’s branches. Pages 357-401 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers</span><span class="font11"> book take you on a world tour. There is no need to rush through it. Spend a little time in each land and enjoy it. Use the world map on pages 415-17 to locate each place. Read the comments that accompany each branch picture. Through the index you can also find other fascinating information about each country. Use this opportunity to get to know members of your spiritual family in other lands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>18</sup> When people get together socially, they sometimes play games that involve knowledge of secular facts. Would it not be far more beneficial to get to know the noteworthy dates and events in the modern-day history of Jehovah’s people? You will find many such facts listed on pages 718-23 in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers</span><span class="font11"> book. That list provides a basic framework; you can add to it from the details found in the rest of the book. Use these as a basis for review. Young ones in the family will probably memorize them quickly. Some of us older ones may be a bit slower. But these are details of theocratic history that we can all benefit from knowing. After you learn the dates and basic facts, build on that foundation. See how many details you can recall concerning each event. Then talk about the part that each event had in the accomplishing of God’s will. Next, discuss how it has affected your own life and how you fit into what Jehovah is doing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> See the Opportunities Open to You: </span><span class="font11">As you read and discuss </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom,</span><span class="font11"> you will find unfolding to your view the grand fulfillment of Isaiah 60:22. The book states on page 519: “F</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ulfillm</span><span class="font11">ent of the promise that ‘the little one would become a thousand’ has surely come to pass, and abundantly so! In each of more than 50 lands where there was not even a ‘little one’ —where there were none of Jehovah’s Witnesses back in 1919, where they had done no preaching at all—there are today more than a thousand praisers of Jehovah. In some of these lands, there are now </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">tens of thousands,</span><span class="font11"> yes, even </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">more than a hundred thousand, of</span><span class="font11"> Jehovah’s Witnesses who are zealous proclaimers of the Kingdom of God! Worldwide, Jehovah’s Witnesses have become ‘a mighty nation’ —more in number as a united global congregation than the individual population of any one of at least 80 self-governing nations of the world.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>20</sup> That work of Kingdom increase has by no means ended. On the contrary, Jehovah has speeded it up to an unprecedented degree. To what extent will you share in it? Are you really aware of all the opportunities that are open to you? As you learn what others are doing, may your own heart be moved to make yourself available to share to the full in the grand work that our loving God is directing by means of Jesus Christ in our day.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Guard Against Mistaken Kindness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people are known for their kind and generous spirit. Often this manifests Itself In a material way when we imitate the neighborly Samaritan that Jesus spoke about in his touching parable. (Luke 10:29-37) Yet, some who are not worthy of material assistance may endeavor to take ad</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">vantag</span><span class="font10">e of qur kindness. Thus, our love for others must be bala</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">nced</span><span class="font10"> with “accurate knowledge and full discernment.” —Phil. 1:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Within the Congregation: </span><span class="font10">For example, someone may say that he is out of work or give other reasons for requesting assistance. At times these individuals are not actively seeking employment but simply wish others to provide them with life’s necessities. Of such ones the apostle Paul ordered: “If anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat.”—2 Thess. 3:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> “Time and unforeseen occurrence” befall us all, so if we are in material need, lacking “our bread for this day.&quot; we should not feel overly anxious, since Jehovah provides for those who love him and are doing his will. (Eccl. 9:11; Matt. 6:11, 31, 32) A needy one may find It beneficial to speak with one of the elders. The elders may be aware of government programs that are set up to provide assistance and may be in a positionto. help complete the paperwork or understand the requirements for such programs. In any event, the elders can evaluate the circumstances of each one requesting assistance and determine what can he done—Compare fTimothy 5:3-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Traveling Impostors: </span><span class="font10">The Society continues to receive reports that some in the congregations have been defrauded of money and m</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ateria</span><span class="font10">l things by traveling impostors. This should not surprise ui. since the Scriptures warn that “wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.” (2 Tim. 3:13) Often these impostors claim that they are stranded and need money in order to obtain transportation and food for a return trip home. Although they may sound sincere, in most cases they are not Jehovah’s Witnesses at all but are only pretending to be.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> If a stranger asks for assistance, it Is wise t</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">o consuTF</span><span class="font10">bne of the congregation elders, who can t</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ake th</span><span class="font10">e lead in determining whether this person is our brother. A telephone call should usually be made to one of the elders in that one's congregation so that the person’s standing may be confirmed. Genuine brothers and sisters who fincTthemselves unexpectedly in need will understand that this type of Inquiry is. being made for the protection of all concerned. On the other hand, impostors will be ex? posed by this sort of scrutiny. There is no need to be un</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">duly</span><span class="font10"> susp</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">iciou</span><span class="font10">s of all who are not known to us, but we must be on guard against wicked impostors.—</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font10"> 9/80 p. 2.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">■ “The last time I called, we discussed the many problems facing mankind and what God promises to do about them. Why, though, has God permitted suffering for so long? The interesting answer is found in part 6 of the brochure we looked at.” Ask the householder to get his copy if convenient. After considering a few paragraphs, we might ask: “What do we need to do to benefit from God’s promises?&quot; The material under section 11, “The New World’s Foundation Now Being Formed,” on pages 28-31, may be highlighted for discussion at the next visit.</span></p>

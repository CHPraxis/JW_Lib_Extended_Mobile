<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Activities During the Summer</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Summertime offers opportunities to share in a variety of activities. Most of us like to take advantage of the nice weather by doing something different and relaxing. However, we have to guard against allowing our theocratic routine to be disrupted.—Phil. 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> We eagerly anticipate the district convention every summer. Have you made definite plans to attend, arranging for transportation and accommodations as needed? Have you thought about including someone in your congregation who may need personal assistance? Such a fine gesture of kindness could bring mutual blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> If you will have time available, such as during a school vacation, have you thought about reaching out for a greater share in the ministry? Many have found this to be a fine time to enroll as auxiliary pioneers. Often this has opened the door to greater privileges of service. Families can experience real joy in spending full days together in the ministry. Whatever the case, can you increase the time you have been spending Th service? With nice weather and longer daylight hours, more should be able to reap the benefits of sharing in evening witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> How about helping a congregation that needs assistance .in covering its territory? There may be others in your congregation who would like to join you in serving for a week or two where the need is greater. If your group is small, perhaps publishers in a neighboring congregation would like to go with you. If you are limited in how far you can travel, the circuit overseer may be able to recommend a nearby congregation that would appreciate your assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Are you planning a vacation </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">away </span><span class="font8">from home? If so, are you making plans to attend the meetings where you will be visiting? What about working in the field service with the brothers there? Including this in your vacation can be very rewarding to you . and to others. (Rom. 1:11, 12) Also, can you do informal witnessing as you travel? Be sure to take along your Bible and a supply of literature. Use some of your free time to catch up on your reading and Bible study. Remember that although we occasionally need a vacation from secular pursuits, we do not want to take time off from serving Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Elders should be alert to keep congregation activities well organized. If any elders or ministerial servants are going to be away, arrangements should be made for others to care for their responsibilities. Keeping the presiding overseer advised well in advance of dates when these brothers will be away will aid him in seeing that appropriate adjustments are made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Yes, summertime can be a very busy time. But distractions can easily disrupt your good routine of Kingdom service. Make the most of your summer opportunities. Define wholesome spiritual priorities, and stick to them—Phil. 1:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Benefiting Fully From the Theocratic Ministry School</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The Theocratic Ministry School has been instrumental in t</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">raining us</span><span class="font8"> in the “art of teaching” so that we can convey Bible truths to others In an e</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">ffectiv</span><span class="font8">e manner. (2 Tim. 4:2) We receive valuable insight into a variety of Bible topics each week. How can we make sure that we are deriving full benefit from the vital instruction this school provides?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Pay careful attention to the o</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">penin</span><span class="font8">g comments, of the school overseer as he highlights some of the interesting points you can learn during the meeting. Think about any questions he may raise and how you can apply the answers in your ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> The instruction talk is not simply a review of the~prihted material. It focuses on the practical value of the information and how it can benefit you personally. Preparing in advance will help you to concentrate better on the main points and to share in the oral review that follows.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Kee</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">ping up</span><span class="font8"> with the weekly Bible reading, can deepen your appreciation of God’s Word. Additional research can reveal an array of new and interesting details that will enhance your understanding of the truth. The presentation of the Bibl</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">e hig</span><span class="font8">hlights is m</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">ore than </span><span class="font8">just a </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">repetition</span><span class="font8"> of the Bible account. After a brief overall review, the speaker will highlight outstanding points in the assigned portion and show how they </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">relate to our li</span><span class="font8">fe and worship. Be attentive so that you can learn how better to apply Bible instruction—Ps. 119:105.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> If you are assigned a student talk, take note of the point of counsel you are currently working on. Re</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">ad over</span><span class="font8"> the suggestions given in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">School Guide^ book</span><span class="font8"> dealing with that speech quality, and try to apply them. When selecting material for your talk, try to emphasize points that will be practical inthe field. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">—sg</span><span class="font8"> pp. 96-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> If you are a sister assigned to give Talk No. 3 or Talk No. 4, try to present the material In a realistic setting. The householder </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">may or may not</span><span class="font8"> agree with everything you say, endeavor to show </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">how you would assist</span><span class="font8"> the individual to reason on the underlying Bible principles. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(sg</span><span class="font8"> pp. 153-8) This </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">helps</span><span class="font8"> the audience </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">to see how to dea</span><span class="font8">l with similar objections encountered In field service. Prepare well in advance, and arrange for an early rehearsal with your householder. It should not be necessary to rehearse after theineeting has started.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Students g</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">iving ta</span><span class="font8">lks are encouraged to sit near </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">the front</span><span class="font8"> of the hall. This saves time and enabl^ the school, overseer to offer his comments in a more personal manner. All can benefit from the kindly, specific suggestions he gives based on the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook. </span><span class="font8">He may not follow the speech points in the order given on the Speech Counsel slip; he will select, a point of counsel based on what you currently need In order to make the best progress.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">' These are all good reasons for us to prepare for and attend the Theocratic Ministry School every week. The instruction we receive can help us to be wise and skillful in our ministry.—Prov. 1:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Every issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font8"> provides a variety of Scriptural presentations that we can use when witnessing. Many publishers who are quite active are eager to get new ideas and use different approaches. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font8"> accommodates them by supplying several suggestions each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It may be. however, that you do not feel the need to keep changing what you use. You may have only a few hours available each month to share in the house-to-house work.

You rn^ty depend upon some often-used texts, including Psalm 37:9-11,2 Peter 3:13, Revelation 21:4, and others.

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Men of faith have demonstrated “godly fear” from the time of Abel and of Noah until the present. (Heb. 11:4, 7) To exercise godly fear means to exhibit “an awe and a profound reverence for the Creator and a wholesome dread of displeasing him.” (iM p. 818) During June, July, and August, we will demonstrate this profound reverence by our attendance at the “Godly Fear” District Convention. Will you be there to enjoy the entire program, from the opening song until the final prayer?. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">- JjZfZci</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Each year we approach the district conven- ' tion with eager anticipation. Although considerable personal effort and </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">expense</span><span class="font9"> may be involved, the blessings to be received are many. We return home with rejoicing, satisfied and built up spiritually. (Compare 1 Kings 8:66.) The association is stimulating, and the convention provides a change of pace. But remember, we gather to worship Jehovah. He commands us to do so. He is teaching us how to benefit ourselves. —Deut. 31:12,13; Ps. 122:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> A Three-Day Convention: </span><span class="font9">The program will be presented at over 165 conventions in the United States this year. The February 15, 1994, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> provided a list of the locations. In addition to English, conventions will be held in Chinese, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and American Sign Language. A complete program in American Sign Language will be presented at Escondido, California, and Jersey City, New Jersey, but there will be no signlanguage interpreting at any other conventions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The program will begin on Friday&gt; at 10:20 a.m. and will conclude on Sunday at approximately 4:15 p.m. On Saturday and Sunday, the program will start at 9:30 am. Doors will open at 7:30 a.m. Only those with specific work assignments will be permitted to enter earlier.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Profound Reverence for Jehovah Impels U</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">s to Atten</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">d: </span><span class="font9">Paul counseled the Hebrew Christians to “render God sacred service with godly fear and awe.”, (Heb. 12:28) Our district convention this year has been prepared to help us do just that. Some obstacles may be encountered that test our determination to attend. They may look like mountains, but with Jehovah’s help these can be conquered. (Matt. 17:20) If una</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ble to</span><span class="font9"> schedule your vacation to include the entire convention, Friday morning through Sunday afternoon, have you prayerfully approached your employer to ask for the time off? (Jas. 1:6-8) School-age children who will be attending one of the earlier conventions while school is still in session should respectfully inform their teachers that they will be absent from school on Friday for this important part of their religious worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Take Advantage of the Investment: </span><span class="font9">What investment is that? The time and effort spent to attend the convention. It would be unwise to make careful plans to attend this summer’s district convention only to return home Sunday evening having missed a large portion of the program. Would you excuse yourself in the middle of a banquet in order to take care of other matters? It was observed at a number of conventions last year that some left after the morning sessions. However, our spiritual maturity and godly fear should not allow us to miss any of what Jehovah has prepared for us.—Compare 1 Corinthians 2:9,10. - '</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Most of us would probably, not think of l</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">eav</span><span class="font9">ing early. Nevertheless, we could still miss a good p</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ortion</span><span class="font9"> of the </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">program</span><span class="font9">. How could this happen? By our not planning ahead to ensure that we receive the maximum benefit from the parts presented. We want to begin the day early enough to have an adequate breakfast and to take care of other necessary matters so that we can be in our seats before the program begins. Getting a good night’s sleep is also important so that we will be alert and able to concentrate on the full day’s program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> A proved method of reaping the most benefit from the program is the taking of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">conservative</span><span class="font9"> notes. It is as important for young ones to take notes as it is for adults. A 16-year-old publisher says: “I write down the scriptures mentioned during a talk. Then I can review the talk at home.”; Another 16-year-old youth adds: “J jot</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, MAY 1994 </span><span class="font9">down main points. It keeps my mind on track.”/ Usually all that you really need for the program is your Bible, a songbook, a medium-size note pad, and a pen or pencil. Of course, parents with small children must take care of their needs, but it is best not to inconvenience ourselves and others with large coolers and an excessive amount of personal items.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> Some brothers record the program, using an audiocassette r</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ecorde</span><span class="font9">r or a vi</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">deo camer</span><span class="font9">a, for replay later at home. Whether one does this is a personal matter, but the experience of some is that once they return to their normal routine, there is little time to replay what has been recorded. In addition, some key points in a talk may be missed while adjusting the recording equipment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> We should make a sincere effort to be in our seats before the program begins. Although we may be in the middle of exchanging happy experiences with old friends when the chairman announces that the program is about t</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">o begin</span><span class="font9">, it shows respect for those on the program, and our brothers generally, if we promptly cease our conversation and take our seats.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> District conventions are always joyous occasions because of Jehovah’s abundant blessing. We receive both spiritual and material benefits. It must be remembered that considerable expense is involved in the rental of the convention facility. Also food costs are on the rise, and the Society purchases good quality food for distribution at each convention. How are these and all other expenses covered? Through our voluntary donations, either in cash or by check made payable to “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” This is in line with the spirit of Psalm 96:8, which encourages us to ^ascribe glory to Jehovah and carry a gift into his courtyards.’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;।</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Will Your Conduct Bring Praise? </span><span class="font9">Each year the May issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> kindly reminds us of the importance of good conduct while attending the district convention. Of course, our conduct should always be exemplary, but when we are gathered in large numbers, we usually come under closer scrutiny by those outside the truth. Our conduct, good or bad, may speak louder than our preaching. We want Jehovah to be praised by what we say and do.—Prov. 27:2; 1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>13</sup> After last year’s “Divine Teaching” District Convention, a security guard at one of the motels observed: “These are the nicest bunch of kids I’ve had to watch in a long time.” Then, after commenting about the bad manners and destructiveness of other groups of young people, he added about the Witness children: “They are well behaved and a pleasure to be around. I wish other conventions held here were like this one.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>14</sup> A newspaper columnist writing in a midwestern paper made this observation about the convention: “Women and girls wore fine dresses, and men and boys wore coats and ties. They earnestly took notes as they listened to four days of speakers. And if cleanliness is next to godliness, well, Jehovah’s Witnesses take that concept to a new level.” Not all reports have been that positive though.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>15</sup> In some locations, children have abused the use of swimming pools. They have got involved in unruly play, remaining in the pool after closing time. Usually this has resulted from having very little or no adult supervision.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>16</sup> At another convention it was reported that there was too much milling around during sessions. Over 1,000 (many of whom were children) were counted in the corridors during the Saturday afternoon program, which would indicate that much more training and supervision are needed by parents. Constant milling around in the corridors creates excessive noise that is distracting to those trying to listen. A few have necessary matters to take care of during the program, but should not the rest of us be in our seats, listening intently?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>17</sup> Most parents are firm with their children about attending congregation meetings each week. Should they not be equally firm when it comes to making sure that their children sit near them and do not wander through the corridors during the program? The convention facility is turned into a large Kingdom Hall, but this is Satan’s system, and it would be easy for unscrupulous people to enter the building with improper motives. You need TO know where YOUR CHILDREN ARE AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING AT ALL TIMES.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> Dress and Grooming: </span><span class="font9">We live in an age where the casual, even sloppy, look is viewed as acceptable. Many people attend church and concerts or dine at restaurants in extremely casual attire. The observation quoted in paragraph 14 shows that there are those who still admire dignified dress, particularly in connection with formal worship. Sloppy, casual dress and inappropriate grooming tell a lot about us. Never forget that the convention building is no longer a sports arena. It is an expanded Kingdom Hall. Some dress respectfully for the convention but after the sessions go to local restaurants and elsewhere dressed inappropriately or immodestly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>19</sup> Candidates for baptism need to be reminded that ce</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">rtain bathing attire</span><span class="font9"> is inappropriate for the occasion. The outfit should be modest and in good taste. Who should determine this? The elders are responsible to see that anyone getting baptized from their congregation does not give any cause for stumbling. (2 Cor. 6:3, 4) This would rule </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">out </span><span class="font9">revealing swimwear and T-shirts with worldly slogans or advertising. It would be appropriate for the elders to discuss this matter with the candidate while reviewing the questions in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font9"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>20</sup> Hotels and Motels: </span><span class="font9">A measure of patience and empathy are often necessary when checking in at the hotel or motel. If a large number are checking in at the same time, there could be some delays. We need to display the fruitage of the spirit at all times but particularly when dealing with employees at motels and restaurants. We also need to be reminded of the need to tip in an appropriate fashion. Please take a few minutes to review the articles “To Tip—Or Not” and “Tips on Tipping” on pages 24-7 of the June 22,1986, issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Aiiake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> Recording Devices: </span><span class="font9">As stated earlier, the use of recording equipment, and particularly videocassette recorders, is a personal decision. If you decide to record, please show consideration for those around you. It may be distracting even when the recording is done from one’s seat. No one should block the view of fellow convention-ers while taping. Furthermore, no recording devices of any sort are to be connected to the electrical or sound systems, nor should they block aisles or walkways.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>22</sup> Seating: </span><span class="font9">The problems associated with saving seats are still in need of attention. Again we would like to remind everyone: SEATS MAY BE SAVE</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">D </span><span class="font9">ONL</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Y FO</span><span class="font9">R YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ANY WHO MAY BE TRAVELING WITH YOU IN YOUR CAR At some conventions when the doors opened at 7:30 each morning, there was a rush as brothers and sisters entered the building. It was observed that “those friends who walked to their seats in the usual manner could find seats only in the very top se</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ctio</span><span class="font9">n of the arena. Many were saving almost whole sections, and then many of the seats they reserved were not filled.” These inconsiderate practices seem to persist despite regular reminders. Should we not search our heart in this matter and meditate on the principles in Philippians 2:3,4?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>23</sup> Each convention makes provisions for those with special needs, such as the elderly and the physically disabled. Please be sure not to occupy seats in one of these sections if you do not qualify. Also, be alert to assist those with special needs to find a seat if they are not accompanied by someone responsible for their care.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>24</sup> Literature and Food Service: </span><span class="font9">When we gather for the district convention, we enjoy an abundance of physical and spiritual food. Both should be received with thanksgiving, nothing being wasted. (2 Chron. 31:10; Prov. 3:10; John 6:12) In recent years it has been noted that a considerable amount of packaged food and drink is being taken and then discarded unopened. Do we want to show appreciation for all of Jehovah’s provisions? Then we will take only what is need</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ed a</span><span class="font9">nd not waste any food. Parents, do your children understand the importance of not wastinglood? You must set a good example for them. Please do not take food away from the convention site for later use. To cut down on crowding in the corridors, it is best that only one family member pick up food for the entire family and not obtain more than what is needed for that meal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>25</sup> On June 3,1994, the first of the “Godly Fear” District Conventions will begin. Have you completed your preparations, and are you now ready to enjoy three days of happy fellowship and spiritual good things? It is our sincere prayer that Jehovah will bless your efforts to convene this summer and be fed at Jehovah’s table of good things at the “Godly Fear” District Convention.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Baptism: </span><span class="font9">Baptismal candidates should be in their seats in the designated section before the program begins on Saturday </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">mornin</span><span class="font9">g, it has been observed that some wear types of attire that are not dignified and detract from the occasion. A </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">modest</span><span class="font9"> bathing suit and a towel should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized. After the baptism talk and prayer by the speaker, the session chairman will give brief instructions to the candidates and then call for a song. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A fter the last verse,</span><span class="font9"> the attendants will direct the candidates to the immersion site. Since baptism in symbol of one’s dedication is an intimate and personal matter between the individual and Jehovah, there is no provision for so-called partner baptisms in which two or more baptismal can-diSaies embrace or hold hands while being baptized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Badge Cards: </span><span class="font9">Please </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">wea</span><span class="font9">r, the 1994 badge card at the convention and* while traveling to and from the convention site. This often makes it possible for us to give a fine witness while traveling. This was outstandingly true last year with regard to the conventions held in Moscow and Kiev. Wearing our badge will also facilitate the operation of the simplified food service arrangement. Badge cards and holders should be obtained through your congregation, as they will </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font9"> be available at the con</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">vention.</span><span class="font9"> Remember to carry your current Medical Directive card. Bethel family members and p</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ionee</span><span class="font9">rs should also have their identification cards with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Rooming: </span><span class="font9">We are again asking for the cooperation of everyone in using only the listing of accommodations provided by the convention. If we bypass the Society’s arran</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">gement</span><span class="font9">, and secure a motel not on the approved list, we undermine much of the hard work of our brothers who negotiate with the motels for better rates! IF YOU EXPERIENCE A PROBLEM WITH A MOTEL, please do not hesitate to bring it to the attention of the Rooming Department overseer at the convention so that he can assist you in resolving the matter right away. Congregation secretaries should be sure that Special Needs Room Request forms are promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should immediately notify both the landlord or motel and the convention Rooming Department so that the room can be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Baby Strollers: </span><span class="font9">In many locations baby strollers cannot be used in places of public assembly. Fire regulations prohibit parking them in corridors and aisles or between rows of seats. Since large crowds may cause congested conditions, baby strollers are potentially dangerous not only to the baby but also to any who may stumble over them. So please do not bring them to the convention site. However, infant or car seats are permissible, since these can be secured in seats next to the parents. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Service: </span><span class="font9">Can you set aside some time at the convention to assist in one of the departments? Serving our brothers, if only for a few hours, can be very helpful and bring a good measure of satisfaction. If you can assist, please report to the Volunteer Service Department at the convention. Children under 16 years of age can also make a fine contribution by working under the direction of a parent or other responsible adult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Words of Caution: </span><span class="font9">By keeping alert to potential problems, we can save ourselves unnecessary difficulty. Often thieves and other unscrupulous individuals will prey on people who are away from their home environment. Be sure your vehicle is locked </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">al all times,</span><span class="font9"> and never leave anything visible to tempt someone to break in. Thieves and pickpockets find their best pickings at large gatherings. It would not be wise to leave any valuables at your seat. You cannot be sure that evefyonF'around you is a Christian. Why offer any temptation? Reports have been received of attempts made by some outsiders to lure children away. KEEP YOUR CHILDREN IN SIGHT AT ALL TIMES.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Cable television that is available in many motels often features lewd, pornographic movies. Be alert to this snare, and do not permit children to have unsupervised access to the TV in the room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Please </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">do not phone</span><span class="font9"> the management of the convention auditorium seeking information about any convention matters. If the information is not available from the elders, please write to the co</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">nven</span><span class="font9">ti</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">on address</span><span class="font9"> found on the back of the Special Needs Room Request forms on file with each congregation secretary.</span></p>

If the congregation does not have a supply of booklets, an appropriate brochure may be used as an alternate offer. The 32-page booklets should not be requested from the Society, but congregations should use such booklets as they now have on hand. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August: </span><span class="font8">Any of the following 32-page brochures may be used: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?, Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, ‘Look!

Please do not request 32-page booklets, since these are not available from the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">■ Before</span><span class="font8"> undertaking a Kingdom Hall construction project, the elders should contact the Regional Building Committee for their area. The regional committees have been provided information that can assist congregations in making wise decisions. It is prudent to consider suggestions offered by the regional committees </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font8"> purchasing such items as chairs, wall covering, carpet, or heating and air-conditioning equipment. While the Society does not recommend any suppliers, information is shared with the Regional Building Committees concerning suppliers that have previously provided quality materials in a reliable manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ Congregations may now begin requesting </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures—With References/ Insight on the Scriptures</span><span class="font8"> in Spanish. This is available on 5 1/4-lnch 1.2-megabyte or 3 1/2-lnch 1.44-megabyte diskettes. A computer with a hard disk having a minimum of 20 megabytes of free space is required.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare Bible Students for the Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The ultimate goal in conducting Bible studies is to make new disciples, workers who will join us in teaching others. (Matt. 28:19, 20) So the purpose of the study is not Just to impart knowledge; it should instill </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">heartfelt faith</span><span class="font8"> in our students and prepare them to share their hope with others. (2 Cor. 4:13) In what practical ways can we help them become qualified to teach others? —2 Tim. 2:2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">-Set the Ministry as a Goal: </span><span class="font8">From the very start, make it clear that true worship involves “public declaration for salvation.&quot; (Rom. 10: 10) Our very name, Jehovah’s Witnesses, implies that we must speak to others. Help them to see that their being taught is not just for their own salvation. When they become teachers themselves, those who listen to them also have opportunity for salvation—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Review What Is Learned: </span><span class="font8">Periodic reviews of what has been learned are a valuable teaching aid. They help the student to grow spiritually as newly learned truths are embedded in his mind and heart. We have experienced this ourselves when answering the review questions that are included in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> Study. Prepare simple, direct questions for your student to answer in his own words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Your review could take the form of a field service setting. Pose a question or describe a situation commonly encountered when witnessing to others. With you acting as the householder, let your studerit demonstrate what he would say. Commend him for what he did well, and offer practical suggestions that will help him to be even more effective next time. This training will teach him how to use what he has learned and will develop his skill in using the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Reasoning</span><span class="font8"> Book: Make sure your student has a copy of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font8">book, and train him to use it. Show how it provides suggestions on starting conversations, answering Bible questions, or dealing with objections. Use the book in the study to demonstrate ways to speak to others in a convincing manner. This book can build his confidence, increasing his initiative to declare the Kingdom message.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Stress the Importance of the Meetings: </span><span class="font8">Congregation meetings, especially the Service Meeting and the Theocratic Ministry School, are designed to prepare us for field service. All the fundamentals for effective witnessing are reviewed and demonstrated by those who are experienced and skilled. Emphasize the importance of the meetings, and do what you can to help him to attend. Regular attendance can provide your student the stimulus he needs to become a true disciple of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Not to be overlooked is your own personal example. Your willingness and regularity in the preaching work show your deep appreciation for the truth. Such a course encourages your student to do more to demonstrate his faith. (Luke 6:40) All of this can help a new person to view the ministry as a privilege and to be grateful to have a share in it.—1 Tim. 1:12.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Use the Magazines to Share the Truth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">'The value of truthful, factual information is largely undermined in today's society because of exaggerated advertising, misleading political promises. and deceptive international claims. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">are unique in that they alone declare the truth about God's Kingdom and explain what all must do to enjoy the eternal blessings ft will bring.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> In </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">one coun</span><span class="font8">try a ministry </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">of inf</span><span class="font8">ormation </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">official</span><span class="font8"> who appreciated the value of these two magazines readily assisted in getting approval for their distribution. He stated: “I consider </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> one of the best magazines; I am only too glad to help.”) It is our privilege to help others by distributing these journals that can impart lifegiving knowledge. (John 17:3) How will you present these valuable magazines during May? Perhaps the following suggestions will be helpful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you are featuring the opening articles in the May 15 “Watchtower,” you might say: </span><span class="font8">■ “We’re talking to people about the world’s bestselling book. Do you know what it is? [Allow for a reply.] We’re talking about the Bible. There must be a very good reason why so many people have purchased the Bible. The reason is found at 2 Timothy 3:16.” After reading the text, highlight appropriate points in one of the articles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Or after a brief introduction, you could say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “You’ve probably noted that in recent years there has been g</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">rowing c</span><span class="font8">oncern worldwide over the problems facing children. What problems of children do you see locally that are of concern to you?” Allow for a reply. Point to some of the serious problems children are going through around the world as discussed in the opening articles of the May 8 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font8"> and direct attention to the solution ottered by God’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> In your record of return visits, likely you have a list of those who showed a little interest initially, but nothing ever came of it. Since there was only limited response, you may not feel a need to keep calling back. But you may be able to use this list to develop a magazine route. When you note an article that you feel might be appealing to a particular person, make it a point to visit that individual and offer the magazine.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Informal Witnessing: </span><span class="font8">This is an excellent way to create interest in the magazines. A discreet display of the eye-catching covers may be enough to start a conversation. A sister laid some issues on her desk so that fellow workmates could see them as they passed by; she was able to place several.

<p><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">July 1994 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 37, No. 7</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">House to House Without Letup</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> In ancient Israel, sacrifices were offered daily. (Ex.2f):38-42) The fire of the altar was kept burning; the ascending smoke was “a restful odor” that pleased Jehovah. (Ex. 29:18) Today, we are urged to “offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.” (Heb. 13:15) Instead of using sacrifices prescribed by the law. we worship Jehovah by recounting his praises without letup. —Isa. 43:21; Acts 5:42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Jesus Christ, the greatest Witness ever to walk this earth, taught us how we must carry on pure worship by offering sacrifices of praise. He taught his disciples that there was an urgency to the message they preached. He knew that the most effective way to reach people with the good news was to talk to them personally in their homes. (Matt. 10:7,12) So we find that the apostles followed his divinely inspired direction to preach from house to house. —Acts 20:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> It is no different today. As Jesus’ disciples, true Christians follow his example by preaching the good news from house to house. Though we may be criticized and persecuted for that, millions have learned the truth and hundreds of thousands of new disciples are joining the ranks of the great crowd each year, giving evidence that this is Jehovah’s way of accomplishing his will. That is why we persevere in our ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">' Benefits of Preaching From House to Houses </span><span class="font8">“God is not partial... The man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.” (Acts 10:34, 35) Going directly to each house in our territory clearly demonstrates impartiality, giving everyone opportunity to hear the Kingdom message regularly. In turn receptive ones receive personalized assistance according to their Individual needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Almost all publishers, including younger ones, the elderly, and even those who are new, can participate in the house-to-house work. In this way each one can make “public declaration for salvation.&quot; (Rom. 10:10) Participation with others in the house-to-house ministry draws us together in the bonds of love and unity. At the same time, we are given an opportunity to display our endurance when we encounter indifference or opposition. This public display of faith makes us “a theatrical spectacle,” which helps sincere ones to realize that we have an organized arrangement for teaching the Bible and that they can benefit from it. (1 Cor. 4:9) Everything clearly shows that Jehovah is blessing the house-to-house work and using it to gather the great crowd to his “house” of pure worship.—Isa. 2:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' Now more than at any other time in history, people need to hear the Kingdom message. Let us keep on preaching from house to house without letup until Jehovah says it is enough. (Isa. 6:11) Doing so, we will be rewarded with the joy that comes from sharing in the important and beneficial house-to-house ministry in this time of the end.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Finding Interested Ones by Means of Effective Street Witnessing</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jesus instructed his disciples to search out those who deserve to hear the Kingdom good news. (Matt. 10:11) Yet. in many areas today, it is becoming more and more difficult to contact people at their homes. So, what can be done to reach deserving ones who may be missed?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Street witnessing can be an effective way to find people missed in the house-to-house work. We can do street witnessing at bus stops, near high-security apartment buildings, in public parks, and in other places where people go about their daily affairs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> When street witnessing is mentioned. some have feelings of apprehension. They may be hesitant to share in that work because they tend to be shy or they anticipate being rebuffed by people who resent the Kingdom message. These anxieties are usually unfounded. Those who are experienced in this activity report that it is no more difficult than door-to-door witnessing. In fact, they have found that most people are used to being approached on the street for various reasons, and some may be more inclined to converse or listen than they would be if we knocked at their door. So if we ‘muster up boldness.’ we may be pleasantly surprised. —1 Thess. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> How can street work be done most effectively? It is important to prepare well. Read the magazines ahead of time, and select one or two talking points that you feel will interest the people you meet. A presentation of 30 seconds is about right. Since the goal Is to make personal contact with others, choose a location where a considerable number of people regularly pass by. Although it may be advisable to have another publisher close by, It is usually best to work separately. Publishers who stand together may be inclined to pass the time conversing with each other and not be attentive to those of the public who may be disposed to listen to the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Standing in one spot and simply displaying the magazines is not as effective as taking the initiative to approach individuals. Try to establish eye contact. Be warm, friendly, and direct as you endeavor to start a conversation. In some cases, you may have to walk a few paces with the person while speaking with him. If he is responsive, offer the magazines. If the magazines are refused, you may want to offer a tract.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Usually it is best to prepare a brief presentation that raises a question or makes a statement that will create interest. If there is a suitable response, try to obtain the person’s name, address, and perhaps even his telephone number so that you can follow up the interest. You might say: “If you would like to learn more, I would be happy to visit you at your home or arrange for another Witness to do so.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> An elder engaging in street witnessing approached a woman and learned that she had never had occasion to talk with the Witnesses at her home. She accepted a book and agreed to having a sister visit her in her home at a convenient time. Many more deserving ones can surely be found and assisted if we are effective in street witnessing.—Acts 17:17.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Younger Ones Need a Good Example</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> We rejoice to have with us a growing number of young people who are ‘praising Jehovah’s name.’ (Ps. 148: 12, 13) Many of them are still quite young in years. Their progress is largely determined by the training and example provided by their parents and other older ones in the congregation. Not to be overlooked, however, Is the Influence exercised by other young people, especially older teenagers and young adults. If you are in this age group, these comments may benefit you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Young people In their preteens are inclined to imitate older teenagers. They have the natural desire to be like close associates whom they admire. They tend to look up to other youths who are somewhat older and who give the appearance of being knowledgeable and more advanced. As a result, they may Imitate your speech and conduct as well as your appreciation for spiritual values and your participation in congregation activities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> As an older teenager, you have a privilege as well as a weighty responsibility. Right now, your example is likely influencing your younger companions. Ask yourself, 'What kind of influence do I exert on younger ones? Am I serious-minded, avoiding foolishness and wrong “desires Incidental to youth”? Do I demonstrate obedience and respectfulness toward my parents, the elders, and other older persons?’ (2 Tim. 2:22; Col. 3:20) What you say and do may be a major factor in the spiritual progress of other younger ones who observe your actions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">* Preaching the Kingdom message is the primary work of the congregation. Your willing and regular participation can encourage your companions to be more active. If you are able to take up the pioneer service, your friends will be motivated in a similar way. Commenting at the meetings and volunteering your help in performing necessary tasks at the Kingdom Hall may also set a good example.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Even though Timothy was no longer in his teens when Paul gave him the following advice, you teenagers can apply it: “Become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.” (1 Tim. 4:12) Your enthusiastic and whole-souled participation in Jehovah’s service can motivate your associates and younger observers in a positive way. helping them to make progress toward becoming spiritually full-grown men. (Eph. 4:13) Teenagers who are part of families that have just begun to study may be attracted to the truth by what they see in you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Even more Important, your diligence in demonstrating godly qualities reflects favorably on Jehovah and his organization. (Prov. 27:11) Sincere observers will marvel at the striking contrast between you and the young people of the world. So you have a unique opportunity to help younger ones while you are making a valuable contribution to Jehovah’s praise.—Ps. 71:17.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">■ What should the secretary do when a regular pioneer moves into the congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The secretary should notify the Society, using the space provided on the back of the Congregation Report (S-l). He should also promptly contact the secretary of the pioneer’s former congregation and request all the Congregation’s Publisher Record cards (S-21) on file as well as a letter of introduction from the Congregation Service Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When a pioneer makes a major move, he often has some difficulties in getting settled and establishing a good routine for service. A pioneer appreciates it very much when elders offer loving assistance to him so that his transition to the new congregation is as smooth as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Reminder: The secretary provides replacement Pioneer Service Identification cards (S-202) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font8"> for pioneers who move to the congregation from within the contiguous United States. Pioneers who lose their card, who change their name because of marriage or divorce, or who move from areas served by another branch (including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico) should receive their new card from the Society, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">not the secretary. </span><span class="font8">The secretary or the pioneer should write the Society, explain the situation, and request a new card.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Others Learn the Truth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jesus came to earth to bear witness to the truth. To get the truth preached to others, he trained his disciples to be teachers. He was so confident of their success in teaching others that he called them ‘public instructors.’ (Matt. 13:52) He likened each one to a learned man having a veritable treasure store from which to draw. Jesus’ disciples today use the printed page to speed up the Kingdom-preaching work. For example, many congregations have a variety of booklets to use in helping others become disciples. How can these valuable instruments be used?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> To start a conversation leading into offering the booklet “A Secure Future—How You Can Find It,&quot; you might ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Have you ever wondered why it is that in spite of all man’s efforts, prospects for a secure future seem quite dim? [Allow for response.] The Bible explains why so many efforts have failed.” Read Psalm 146:3, 4. After reasoning with the householder on information in paragraph 6, you could ask: “Who is really able to provide us with long-term security?” Depending on the householder’s response, you may decide to discuss appropriate points from paragraph 7 or arrange to do that at a future time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Here is one way you may be able to use the booklet “Is There a God Who Caresf”:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Many people have asked the question that appears in the caption below these two illustrations. [Read the question at the bottom of pages 6 and 7, and allow for response.] Since a loving God would not promote both good and bad at the same time, what do you think of his promise recorded here at Isaiah 65:21-24?&quot; If you get a comment that shows a measure of interest, turn to paragraph 37, and explain what will be accomplished by God’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* When offering the booklet “There Is Much More to Life!,” you could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “For many the quality of life has been reduced to dreary, monotonous drudgery. What do you think is needed to make life more meaningful? [Let householder express his opinion.) The Bible shows that God has better things in store for us. See what he says here at Revelation 21:4, 5.” If appropriate, continue the discussion with points from paragraph 42 of the booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Using the brochure “Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, ” a younger publisher might ask:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Would you like to live in a paradise earth like this? [Show the front and back cover, and allow for a comment.) My family and I look forward to living there because of what the Bible says here at John 17:3.” If interest is observed after reading the scripture, offer to leave the brochure for the person to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> If you are using other booklets or brochures in your ministry this month, you may pattern your introductions and presentations on the foregoing suggestions. Remember to be brief and to make positive and upbuilding comments to arouse the interest of householders.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has given us the truth. We should seize the opportunities set before us to share it with others, both in printed form and in our conversations with the people we meet. In this way we prove ourselves to be public Instructors for the lasting benefit of others.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How Will They Hear Unless We Return?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> “How . . . will they hear without someone to preach?” (Rom. 10:14) Indeed, how will they grasp the meaning of the truth unless we make effective return visits? Any call where we were able to converse with the householder about the Kingdom message merits a return visit. This month we may be able to follow up our initial conversation with additional Scriptural thoughts from whichever booklet we placed, and that may lead successfully into a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> If you placed the booklet “A Secure Future—How You Can Find It, ” you may be able to initiate a conversation that would lead into a Bible study this way. Pointing to the front cover, you could ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Would you like to live in a world where a secure future is guaranteed for you and your family? [Allow for a response. Then turn to paragraph 2.) All of us share this desire, although many doubt that it will ever be possible. For God, who promises to make this a reality, it is not impossible.” Read Isaiah 32: 17,18 as it is quoted in paragraph 2, or read it from your Bible. Continue, explaining that there are people around the world who are already experiencing the Joy and peace of mind that come with a sure hope for the future. Discuss Scriptural thoughts in paragraph 3, and then explain how a study of the booklet can help the householder learn more. If the person is interested, make arrangements for an early return visit to continue the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* When you return after placing the booklet “Is There a God Who Caresf,” perhaps something like this will be effective: </span><span class="font8">■ “On my previous visit, we discussed the question, Is there a God who cares? Do you think God cares enough about us to bring an end to suffering and violence? [After the person responds, turn to paragraph 32, and continue.) God has promised to replace this wicked world with a new one inhabited by good people who will be able to live in peace. (Read Psalm 37:11.) You and I can also enjoy life in that new world if we believe the Bible and apply its counsel.” Explain our program for helping people study the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> When you make a return visit after placing the brochure “Look! I Am Making All Things New, ” you might start by showing the picture on the cover and then asking the question:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “What do you think it would be like to live in a perfect world? [Get householder’s comments.) What you see in this picture is not just a figment of the imagination; it is based on sure promises stated in the Bible. [Read Revelation 21:4 and Psalm 37:11, 29.] I would like to explain how you and your family can enjoy this blessing.&quot; If the householder manifests interest, continue the discussion, and offer a Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> When we find sincere people who are searching for the truth, we demonstrate our genuine love by returning to help them act on what they have heard. We use the sacred truths entrusted to us for the everlasting blessing of ourselves and those who listen.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">December 1994 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 37, No. 12</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Model to Follow Closely</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jesus unquestionably was the greatest man who ever lived. He set a perfect example for his disciples. Although we cannot measure up to his standard of perfection, we are urged to “follow his steps closely.” (1 Pet. 2:21) We should desire to be as much like Jesus as possible, zealously sharing the truth with others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Jesus was more than a preacher; he was a superlative teacher. “The crowds were astounded at his way of teaching.” (Matt. 7:28) Why was he so effective? Let us take a close look at his “way ofteaching.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How We Can Follow Jesus: </span><span class="font8">Jesus had been taught by his Father. (John 8:28) His motive was to honor Jehovah and glorify His name. (John 17:4,26) In our preaching and teaching, our motive should also be to honor Jehovah and not to draw attention to ourselves.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’ Everything Jesus taught was based on God’s Word. He continually referred to what was written in the inspired Scriptures. (Matt. 4:4,7; 19:4; 22:31) We want to direct our listeners to the Bible; thus we let them see that what we preach and teach is based on the highest authority.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Jesus used brief, practical, uncomplicated expressions. For example, in explaining how we can gain God’s forgiveness, he encouraged us to be forgiving of others ourselves. (Matt. 6: 14, 15) We should try to explain the Kingdom message in simple, down-to-earth terms.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’Jesus skillfully used illustrations and questions to stimulate the thinking of others. (Matt. 13:34, 35; 22:20-22) Illustrations about common, everyday matters can help people understand complicated Bible doctrines. We should ask questions that encourage our listeners to think about what they hear. Leading questions can help them come to right conclusions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Jesus took time to explain difficult matters to those who asked for more Information. Those truly Interested, such as his disciples, were able to get the sense of what Jesus taught. (Matt. 13:36) We should likewise be helpful when questions are asked in sincerity. If we do not know the answers, we can research the subject and return with the information at a later time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> Jesus used object lessons to teach. An example of this was his washing the feet of his disciples, even though he was their Master. (John 13:2-16) If we show a humble spirit, those being taught will be motivated to apply what they are learning.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’Jesus appealed to people's hearts and to their love for righteousness. We want to reach hearts too. We try to appeal to the inborn desire of all mankind to worship a higher personage and to live with others in peace and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“During December we can share with others the things we have learned about Jesus by offering the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.</span><span class="font8"> Our imitating Jesus’ teaching qualities may motivate sincere ones to listen as we explain what he taught—Matt. 10:40.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Appreciation for God’s House</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> In Bible times Jehovah commanded his people to assemble together regularly at his house. (Lev. 23:2) These gatherings helped them keep their minds on God’s word, providing time for meditation, association, and discussion of Jehovah’s Law. Their minds became filled with God’s thoughts, which brought rich spiritual blessings. These were truly happy occasions. The arrangement promoted unity and clean worship. Gatherings in God’s house today are no less important.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> How Can We Show We Appreciate Meetings? </span><span class="font8">Some congregations report low meeting attendance. Occasionally a person’s situation may prevent him from attending a meeting. But have you allowed relatively minor problems to interfere with regular meeting attendance? Some may decide to stay home if they have a slight headache or feel tired after a busy day. Others have felt obligated to entertain unbelieving relatives who want to visit. Some have even missed meetings In order to watch a favorite</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">TV program or some sporting event. The level of appreciation demonstrated in these situations obviously falls short of the heartfelt desire expressed by the sons of Korah: “My soul has yearned and also pined away for the courtyards of Jehovah.&quot;—Ps. 84:2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Although there Is an abundance of spiritual food provided at the meetings, some in attendance have difficulty paying attention. They may find themselves, daydreaming, thinking about the day’s anxieties, or even dozing off. Many have found that taking brief notes helps them keep alert and focus on what is being said. Writing things down also Impresses the information on the mind. In addition, advance preparation is an aid to benefiting fully. If we prepare well, we will be able “to pay more than the usual attention.”—Heb. 2:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’Children as well as adults need to absorb the instruction provided at meetings. What the children learn will be very limited If parents provide toys or coloring books to keep them occupied and quiet. There is a lack of proper discipline when children are allowed to play, talk, cry, or do other things that disturb those sitting nearby. Frequent and unnecessary trips to the rest room or water fountain during the meeting are usually reduced when the child knows that one of his parents will always accompany him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Punctuality Is Important: </span><span class="font8">Occasionally, unavoidable circumstances may prevent us from arriving at a meeting on time, but habitually arriving late after the opening song and prayer shows a lack of respect for the sacred purpose of the meetings and our responsibility to avoid disturbing others. Remember that singing and praying with our brothers at congregation meetings is part of our worship. Habitual tardiness is usually a result of poor organization or failure to plan in advance. Being punctual shows that we respect and appreciate our meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> As the day draws ever nearer, the need to assemble together can only become greater. (Heb. 10:24, 25) Let us show our appreciation by regular attendance, advance preparation, punctuality, rapt attention, and then application of what we learn.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Song 94 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Will Your Meeting Times Change?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In cases where several congregations using the same Kingdom Hall have agreed to rotate or adjust meeting times, this should be done the first of January. A willingness to cooperate with the arrangement that has been established demonstrates mutual love and consideration. Often the change in meeting times will be to your personal advantage, making meeting attendance more convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the other hand, the change taking place this year may not fit In well with your schedule of activity. It could require adjustments in your normal routine that may be somewhat unsettling. Each one’s willingness to cooperate demonstrates an appreciation for the overall arrangement, which works out for the mutual benefit of everybody involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, the next rotation of meeting times may be more to your liking. In the meantime, you are encouraged to make the necessary personal adjustments so you can attend all weekly meetings according to the schedule that has been decided upon by the congregation. Strive to maintain the view of the psalmist David, who declared: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’&quot;—Ps. 122:1.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>PAY ATTENTION TO THE PROPHETIC WORD</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “We have the prophetic word made more sure.” (2 Pet. 1:19) Why did Peter say this? The Kingdom prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures as well as those from Jesus Christ himself had been confirmed, or “made more sure,” by what Peter and two other disciples had seen and heard at the transfiguration scene some 32 years earlier. This dramatic vision had reassured them that Jesus Christ would indeed come into Kingdom power with radiant glory and with the full support of his Father. Christians in the first century were ‘doing well in paying attention to that prophetic word as to a lamp shining,’ in that their hearts would otherwise be dark. Paying attention to the illuminating prophetic word would keep them alert and enlightened to the dawn of a new day, when the “daystar,” Christ, would rise in Kingdom glory. —2 Pet. 1:16-19; Matt. 17:1-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> We were not on hand to see the glorious transfiguration scene along with Peter. Yet, Christians in this generation who have paid attention to the prophetic word have been highly privileged to see, not a preview of Christ’s Kingdom, but overwhelming evidence that the glorious King rules in reality! Each passing year since 1914, the prophetic word is made more sure as we witness the fulfillment of the various elements of the striking “sign” Jesus gave of his royal “presence.” An important part of the sign is that the announcement of his government, or Kingdom, would be made in all the nations before the King brings an end to this system of things. Under Christ’s direction, the Kingdom-preaching work is being done now in 231 lands on a scale never before imagined. (Matt. 24: 3-14) Furthermore, as the time for “the great tribulation” draws close, the enthroned King has been gathering “a great crowd” “out of all nations” who come to exercise faith in the ransoming “blood of the Lamb.”—Rev. 7:9,10,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Since the “daystar” has risen, that is, Christ has come into Kingdom power, is there still reason to pay attention to the prophetic word? Yes! The glorified Jesus Christ gave the apostle John a series of visions that make up the book of Revelation. While these were of encouragement and instruction to the early Christians, they are of special value to those living in “the Lord’s day,” where we now find ourselves. (Rev. 1:10) That is why the congregations of Jehovah’s people are now making a further study of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font9"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> “Happy is he who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and who observe the things written in it; for the appointed time is near.” (Rev. 1:3) If we are to be happy, we must get the sense, yes, the real understanding, of these prophetic visions. What does this require? Repetition is needed to sound down into our hearts the import of the Revelation account. The apostle Peter, a member of the first-century governing body, recognized the value of repeating fundamental truths to ‘rouse up’ his brothers spiritually. (2 Pet. 1:12,13) The modern-day “faithful and discreet slave” likewise helps us keep our appreciation alive by repeatedly drawing our attention to the prophetic word.—Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> How to Pay Attention: </span><span class="font9">What kind of attention does the prophetic word in Revelation deserve? The apostle Paul reminds us that God has not spoken to Christians through angels or prophets as he communicated with his pre-Christian servants. Rather, Jehovah has communicated with us through his most cherished Son, whom he appointed “heir of all things.” (Heb. 1:1, 2) “That is why it is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us, that we may never drift away.” (Heb. 2:1) Yes, we must pay attention to God’s Word and especially so to the prophetic word that comes through Jesus Christ. How can we pay special attention to our study of Revelation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> First, it is very important to be present each week at the Congregation Book Study. True, for many of us, this will be the third time that we have studied the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font9"> book. Thus, some may take a somewhat casual view of attending the book study, feeling that even if they miss a meeting, they are already familiar with the material. However, with each passing year, this prophetic information becomes more relevant and timely than it was in 1989 when we first studied the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font9"> book. All of us need to be alert to present-day happenings that are moving rapidly forward in fulfillment of the prophecies of Revelation. Then we can be prepared to act in harmony with Jehovah’s will. Make it your personal goal not to miss a single book study, if at all possible, during this important consideration of Revelation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Second, prepare your lesson well. Look up the cited scriptures and consider how they support the explanation of the verses of Revelation being studied. In this way you will get more than simply answers to the questions. Strive to acquire not just knowledge but wisdom and understanding. (Prov. 4:7) Third, actively participate by making comments and reading scriptures. Make it a goal to answer at least once and preferably several times at each study. Doing so will help you keep your mind focused on the lesson.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Paying more than the usual attention to the prophetic word includes more than preparation, attendance, and participation. It also means that even after the study, we continue to ‘ponder over these things, to be absorbed in them.’ (1 Tim. 4:15) If the prophetic word is to be as a lamp shining in our hearts, we must allow it to affect our inner person deeply—our thoughts, desires, emotions, motivations, and goals. (2 Pet. 1:19) Thus, we should be asking ourselves such questions as: What does this information mean to me personally? What have I learned about Jehovah and his Son, Jesus Christ? What principles underlie the material? Am I getting the sense of the study in my heart? How can I apply these truths in my life? In my family? In the congregation? By making practical application of what we learn, we can say, as did the psalmist: “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.”—Ps. 119:105; Job 29:3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Keep Awake During Critical Times: </span><span class="font9">In the year 33 C.E., Jesus warned his disciples of Jerusalem’s coming destruction and the situation that would signal the time for them to flee to a place of safety. (Luke 19:41-44; 21:7-21) Then, over 30 years passed. It could have seemed to some Judean Christians that little would change in the near future. How timely was the exhortation from the beloved apostle Peter in his second letter, written about 64 C.E., to ‘pay attention to the prophetic word’! (2 Pet. 1:19) Shortly afterward, in 66 C.E., Jerusalem was surrounded by Roman armies. When the Roman forces suddenly withdrew for no apparent reason, Judean. Christians who were awake followed Jesus’ instructions and fled. Then, in 70 C.E., the Roman armies returned and completely destroyed Jerusalem. How glad those Christians must have been that they had paid close attention to Jesus’ prophetic word!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> For what are we modern-day Christians on the watch? In the Revelation visions, Jesus alerted Christians living now to many events that would take place during the Lord’s day. During the past 80 years, a number of these events have already occurred: the birth of the Kingdom; the war in heaven and subsequent defeat of Satan and his demons, followed by their confinement to the vicinity of the earth; the fall of Babylon the Great; and the appearance of the scarlet-colored wild beast, the eighth world power. The fulfillment of these aspects of the prophetic word in Revelation makes it more sure that soon we will see these remaining dramatic events: the sealing of the last members of the 144,000, the completed gathering of the great crowd, the destruction of Babylon the Great, the war of Armageddon, the abyssing of Satan, and the Millennial Rule of Christ. How important that we pay attention to Jesus’ warning: “Look! I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments, that he may not walk naked and people look upon his shamefulness”!—Rev. 16:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> Are we keeping awake? How seriously do we take the prophetic word? Whether we dedicated our lives to Jehovah 5 years ago or 50 years ago, Paul’s words to the Roman Christians aptly apply to us: “You people know the season, that it is already the hour for you to awake from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became believers. The night is well along; the day has drawn near.” Paul then exhorts Christians to “put off the works belonging to darkness” and to “walk decently.” (Rom. 13:11-13) We live in a world that is in pitch darkness morally. What was shocking conduct just 30 or 40 years ago is normal to many worldlings in this last decade of the 20th century. Beware, brothers, that you never allow yourselves to drift into the world’s darkness and become morally drowsy. If you allow yourself to become permissive or tolerant of this world’s degraded thinking and way of life, you will lose sight of the big issues that face us today and that will soon be settled forever: the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty and the sanctification of his name. Spiritual drowsiness will put in jeopardy one’s salvation, now so near at hand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Grow in Heart Appreciation for the Prophetic Word: </span><span class="font9">The ancient Hebrew prophets were keenly interested in the fulfillment of their spirit-inspired utterances about the Messiah. They made “a diligent inquiry and a careful search” as to the outworking of God’s purpose. (1 Pet. 1:10, 11) Likewise, as you pay attention to the prophetic word in the book of Revelation, you will grow in appreciation for spiritual things. Your spiritual appetite will intensify, so that you will be stirred to dig into “the deep things of God.” (1 Cor. 2:10) As you fill your heart with appreciation and love for the prophetic word, there will be no need for anyone to urge you to attend the meetings; you will be moved to attend and participate regularly. (Luke 6:45) And if the ‘word is in your own heart,’ you will be moved to ‘make public declaration of it for salvation.’—Rom. 10:8-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>13</sup> The deeper we get into the time of the end, the more ridiculers will deride us for persisting in our faith in God’s prophetic declarations. (2 Pet. 3:3,4) Yet, we will keep awake to the prophetic word. The lamp of God’s Word shows us where we are in the stream of time. It brilliantly lights up the fact that we are in the last days of this dark world. The daystar has risen! Christ is in Kingdom power! On the horizon we already see the dawn of a new day. May God’s promised new world continue to be as real to us as the Kingdom was to the three apostles who were privileged to see a preview of it in the miraculous vision of Jesus’ transfiguration!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The new Theocratic Ministry School program will begin in January 1995. What is new in the program?

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> As recorded at Matthew 5:14, Jesus told his disciples: “You are the light of the world.” Followers of Jesus were to tell people everywhere about Jehovah’s Kingdom and His loving provision for salvation through Jesus.

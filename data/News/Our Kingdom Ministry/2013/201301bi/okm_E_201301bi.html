<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“Give a Thorough Witness”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> “Do your service thoroughly.” (2 Tim. 4:5, Byington) The apostle Paul certainly had freeness of speech in giving this admonition to Timothy. In fact, between the years 47 and 56 C.E., Paul completed three missionary journeys. The book of Acts makes repeated mention of Paul’s bearing “thorough witness.” (Acts 23:11; 28:23) How can we do so in our day?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. What fine example did the apostle Paul set in the ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> From House to House: In an effort to contact householders who have never heard the good news, we may need to call at a different time of the day. The man of the house may be at home in the evening hours or on the weekend. We should endeavor to speak with someone at each residence, calling repeatedly at not-at-homes. What if your efforts to reach someone are unsuccessful? Let us never forget that Jehovah is using the ‘angels in midheaven’ to direct the work.—Rev. 14:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Publicly and Informally: Jehovah’s servants today make known “true wisdom” to all who will listen. Sometimes this occurs “in the very street” or “in the public squares.” (Prov. 1: 20, 21) When going about our daily routine, are we conscious of giving a witness? Can it be said that we are “intensely occupied with the word”? (Acts 18:5) If so, then we are fulfilling our obligation to “give a thorough witness.” —Acts 10:42; 17:17; 20:20, 21, 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> At times, though, because of personal weakness or inherent shyness, we may hold back from giving a witness. For a certainty, Jehovah understands our limitations. (Ps. 103: 14) Nevertheless, when such occasions arise, we can pray to him for courage to speak up. (Acts 4:29, 31) Also, when doing personal study and meditating on God’s Word, we can focus on deepening our appreciation for the excelling value of the good news. (Phil. 3:8) This will move us to declare it with zeal!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The prophecy of Joel foretold that before the coming of the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah, God’s people would “keep going” and not let anything deter them from preaching. (Joel 2:2, 7-9) May we be fully involved in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">this n</span><span class="font5">ever-to-be-repeated witnessing work!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">4. How do prayer and meditation contribute to our giving a thorough witness?</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Would You Benefit From Having a Personal Territory?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> What is a personal territory? Available in congregations where territory is plentiful, it is a territory of your own, perhaps one near where you live. The Organized book, page 103, explains: “Having a conveniently located personal territory will en</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">able </span><span class="font6">you to make the most of the time you</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. What is a personal territory?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">can devote to field service. Also, you may wish to invite another publisher to work with you in your personal territory.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font5"> To Supplement Group Witnessing: </span><span class="font6">If you obtain a personal territory near your work, you can share in the ministry during your lunch break or before returning home, perhaps with another publisher who works nearby. If you obtain a territory near your home, you and your family can conveniently use it for evening witnessing. Of course, if you do not attend a meeting for field service, it is appropriate to pray for Jehovah’s direction before you start preaching. (Phil. 4:6) In addition, you should balance the time you work in a personal territory with the time you support the congregation’s group witnessing arrangements. Especially on the weekends, when many meet for field service, it is generally best to support your field service group.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font5"> Benefits: </span><span class="font6">If you have a personal territory, you have somewhere to preach whenever your schedule allows. You can devote more time to preaching and spend less time on travel. The increased flexibility allows some to auxiliary or regular pioneer. Since the householders who show interest are in the same neighborhood, it is easier to make return visits and conduct Bible studies. Many find that preaching in a personal territory helps them to get acquainted with the householders and cultivate their trust, especially if the territory can be worked more than once before turning it in so that others may request it. Would working a personal territory help you and your family to accomplish your ministry more fully? —2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>“Have Love for the Whole Association of Brothers”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The inspired words of this title were written down nearly two thousand years ago. (1 Pet. 2:17) But we need to apply them now more than ever! How can we love something as vast as a global brotherhood? And in this loveless world, how can we make sure that our love never fades? (Matt. 24:12) See if you can answer the following questions while watching the video Our Whole Association of Brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(1) </span><span class="font6">When did we formally become part of our Christian brotherhood? </span><span class="font5">(2) </span><span class="font6">What three activities do we share in common with our worldwide brotherhood? </span><span class="font5">(3) </span><span class="font6">How are our brothers showing their determination to preach (a) in the Alaskan wilderness, (b) in the vast harbors of Europe, and (c) in the dense forests of Peru? </span><span class="font5">(4) </span><span class="font6">Why should we never feel that preaching is just an ordinary work? </span><span class="font5">(5) </span><span class="font6">Give examples of how Jehovah’s Witnesses have comforted and supported one another (a) after an earthquake, (b) after a hurricane, and (c) during civil war? </span><span class="font5">(6) </span><span class="font6">In what practical ways can all of us demonstrate the great identifying mark of our Christian brotherhood? (John 13:35) </span><span class="font5">(7) </span><span class="font6">What are the benefits of working together to build our own Kingdom Halls? </span><span class="font5">(8) </span><span class="font6">How did our brothers in Eastern Europe and Russia survive spiritually when the work was under ban? </span><span class="font5">(9) </span><span class="font6">What extraordinary effort do many Witnesses put forth to attend conventions, and why? </span><span class="font5">(10) </span><span class="font6">How has this video strengthened your determination (a) to worship Jehovah at Christian meetings in unity with your brothers, (b) to help others in times of need, and (c) to preach faithfully whenever and however you can? </span><span class="font5">(11) </span><span class="font6">How and when can we use this video in the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our main reason for being a part of our Christian brotherhood is our love for Jehovah. So we love to learn about him and to teach others about him. And we love the people whom Jehovah loves. When we help them in times of need, we do not expect God to thank us. Instead, we thank God because we view our Christian brotherhood as a precious gift from him. As the last days of this loveless world are winding down, may we continue to demonstrate love for the whole association of brothers!</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The 2012 service year closed with a new peak of 10,801 regular pioneers. We rejoice to welcome 2,556 new brothers and sisters who symbolized their dedication by water baptism during the year.

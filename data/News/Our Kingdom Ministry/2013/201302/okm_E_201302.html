<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Will You Auxiliary Pioneer?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Memorial season is a good time to expand our ministry. It is a time when we reflect on Jehovah’s great love in providing his Son as a ransom. (John 3:16) This causes appreciation to well up in our heart, deepening our desire to tell others about Jehovah and what </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">he is</span><span class="font11"> doing for mankind. (Isa. 12:4, 5; Luke 6:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">1. Why is the Memorial season a good time to expand our ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">45) It is also a time when we enjoy a special campaign to invite acquaintances and people in the territory to attend the Memorial with us. Afterward, we endeavor to further the interest of those who attended. Will you expand your ministry by auxiliary pioneering during March, April, or May?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Make March a Special Month: March will be an especially good month to auxiliary pioneer. Those who apply can choose an hour requirement of either 30 hours or 50 hours. If the visit of the circuit overseer falls during March, auxiliary pioneers may attend the entire meeting that he has with the regular and special pioneers. The campaign to extend invitations to the Memorial, which will be held on Tuesday, March 26, 2013, has been lengthened from previous years and will begin on March 1. Additionally, March has five full weekends. So why not seriously consider if you can join in making this the most special month of the year?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Plan Now: Now is the time to review your schedule and see what adjustments are needed in order for you to pioneer. Family cooperation will be important, so take time during your Family Worship evening to discuss your family’s goals and make a schedule. (Prov. 15: 22) If you are not able to auxiliary pioneer, do not be discouraged. Could you adjust your schedule to stay out longer on the days you do go out? Could you go in the ministry an additional day during the week?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> As we increase our activity during March, April, and May, we will increase the joy and satisfaction that we receive from serving Jehovah and giving to others. (John 4:34; Acts 20:35) More important, our self-sacrificing ef</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">forts </span><span class="font11">will bring joy to Jehovah.—Prov. 27:11.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Campaign to Advertise the Memorial Begins March 1</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> On Friday, March 1, we will begin our annual campaign to invite others to attend the Memorial with us. The Memorial will be on March 26, which means that the campaign will be a little longer than </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">in pa</span><span class="font12">st years. This will give more people</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. When will we begin to advertise the Memorial, and why is the campaign longer this year? </span><span class="font12">an opportunity to receive an invitation, especially if they happen to live in an area where the congregation has a large amount of territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Getting Organized: The elders will give direction on how the territory will be covered, including whether the invitations should be left at not-at-homes. If invitations remain after finishing the house-to-house territories, they may be distributed through public witnessing. The service overseer will make sure that a supply of labeled invitations is placed on the literature or magazine counter for the publishers to take, but the invitations will not be put out all at once. We should take only the amount that we will need for one week at a time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> What Will We Say? It is best to be brief, as this will allow us to reach as many people as possible. Page 4 has a sample presentation that we can tailor to our territory. Of course, we do not need to rush away if the householder is friendly or has questions. When sharing in the distribution on the weekends, we should also offer the magazines when appropriate. On March 2, we will focus on distributing invitations rather than on starting Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> We hope that many will join us for the Memorial. The talk will explain who Jesus really is. (1 Cor. 11:26) It will outline how his death helps us. (Rom. 6:23) And it will highlight why it is important that we remember him. (John 17:3) May we have a </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">zealo</span><span class="font12">us share in the campaign!</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Must You Stop?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">When sharing in field service, some publishers customarily stop at a certain time, perhaps at noon. Of course, the circumstances of some may require that they end their field ministry at a specific time. But do you discontinue your preaching simply because others in the group do or because it is the custom in your area to stop at a certain time? Could you extend your ministry for a few more minutes and engage in some form of public witnessing, such as street witnessing? Can you make a return visit or two on the way home? Think of how much good you will accomplish if you find just one interested person at home again or if you place just one more set of magazines with a passerby! If we do not have to stop, staying out a few minutes longer is a simple way to increase our “sacrifice of praise.”—Heb. 13:15.</span></p>

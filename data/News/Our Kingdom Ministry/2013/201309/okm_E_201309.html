<p><span class="font8">Song 96 and Prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Take as a Pattern the Prophets —Amos</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Have you ever felt unqualified to preach because of having a humble background? If so, you can take courage from the example of Amos. He was a sheep raiser and a seasonal laborer, yet Jehovah empowered him to pro</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">claim</span><span class="font9"> a weighty message. (Amos 1:1; 7:14, 15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">1. Why can the example of Amos be a source of encouragement to us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Similarly, in our day, Jehovah uses those who are humble and lowly. (1 Cor. 1:27-29) What other lessons for our ministry can we learn from the prophet Amos?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font10"> Remain Firm in the Face of Opposition: </span><span class="font9">When Amaziah, a calf-worshipping priest in the northern ten-tribe kingdom of Israel, heard the prophesying of Amos, he retorted, in effect: ‘Go home! Leave us alone! We have our own religion!’ (Amos 7:12, 13) In his appeal to King Jeroboam to ban the work of Amos, Amaziah twisted the words of the prophet. (Amos 7:7-11) But Amos was not intimidated. Today, some clergymen seek political support in their effort to persecute Jehovah’s people. However, Jehovah assures us that no weapon formed against us will have lasting success.—Isa. 54:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font10"> Declare God’s Judgment and Future Blessings: </span><span class="font9">Although Amos prophesied judgment against the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel, he concluded the Bible book bearing his name with Jehovah’s promise of restoration and abundant blessings. (Amos 9:1315) We too speak of God’s coming “day of judgment,” but this is only part of the “good news of the kingdom” that we must declare. (2 Pet. 3:7; Matt. 24:14) Jehovah’s destruction of the wicked at Armageddon will clear the way for a paradise earth.—Ps. 37:34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Preaching the Kingdom message in a world with many opposers certainly tests our determination to live up to our dedication and to do Jehovah’s will. (John 15:19) Nevertheless, we are certain that Jehovah will continue to qualify us to accomplish his will, as he did Amos.—2 Cor. 3:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">2. Why can we remain firm in the face of opposition in the ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. What twofold message do we declare today?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. What assurance do we have that we can accomplish Jehovah’s will?</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> How It Will Be Studied: The conductor will need to apportion his time so that each lesson receives equal coverage. He will introduce each of the 28 lessons by reading the question that forms the title. Then, he will invite the reader to read the introductory paragraph. Next, the conductor will ask the audience a question that he has prepared for the introduction. Thereafter, each section that begins with a statement in bold print should be read and discussed separately. After the section is read, the conductor will invite comments on how it answers the question that is the title of the lesson. The brochure also has many illustrations that can be commented on. Key scriptures should be read as time allows. Before moving on to the next lesson, the conductor will review by asking the questions at the bottom of the page. If there is a “Find Out More” box, he will have it read, and then he will invite comments from the audience on how a Bible student will benefit from following the suggestion. If time allows at the conclusion of the study, the conductor may use the titles of the lessons as review questions. Keep in mind that this is not necessarily the procedure for conducting a home Bible study.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“I’ll Take Your Literature if</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">You Take Mine”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That is the proposition of some householders. Since we do not exchange our Bible study aids for religious literature that disseminates error, how might we answer tactfully? (Rom. 1:25) We could say: “Thank you for your offer. What does this say about the solution to mankind’s problems? [Allow for response. If he invites you to read his literature to find the answer, you can remind him that you did not offer literature without telling him what it contains. Then read or quote Matthew 6:9, 10.] Jesus indicated that God’s Kingdom will cause God’s will to be done on earth. Therefore, the only religious literature that I read highlights God’s Kingdom. May I show you from the Bible some specific things that God’s Kingdom will accomplish?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Could You Extend an Invitation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In many congregations there are publishers whose share in the ministry is limited because of chronic health problems or advancing age. (2 Cor. 4:16) Could you invite one in such circumstances to accompany you on a Bible study? If the publisher is housebound, perhaps you could even conduct the study at his or her home. Could you occasionally make arrangements to take an infirm publisher with you to a few doors in the house-to-house ministry or on a return visit or two? Many elderly publishers have much experience in the ministry. Therefore, your efforts will not result only in encouragement to them. You too will benefit. (Rom. 1:12) In addition, your efforts to demonstrate love in this way will be rewarded by Jehovah.—Prov. 19:17; 1 John 3:17, 18.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark15"></a>To Start Bible Studies on the First Saturday in October</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">“We’re making just a brief visit on our neighbors today. Many whom we have talked to say that one of the most difficult situations they have had to face is the death of a loved one. Is that how you feel too? [Allow for response.] I found this to be encouraging.” Show the back of the October 1 Watchtower, and consider together the material under the first question and at least one of the cited scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Announcing Jehovah’S Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“We’re visiting briefly to encourage Bible reading. We know that some people have an interest in the Bible; others do not. What about you? [Allow for response.] The Bible makes this bold claim. [Read 1 Thessalonians 2:13.] I’m sure you will agree that if it is true that the Bible is a book from God, then it is worth reading. This magazine briefly outlines what the Bible is all about and why it should interest us.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“I would like to hear your opinion on this question: Is contentment possible if we do not have a lot materially? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible says. [Read 1 Timothy 6:8.] This magazine presents a balanced view of material possessions and discusses three valuable things that money cannot buy.”</span></p>

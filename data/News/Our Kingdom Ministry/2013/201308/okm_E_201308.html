(Ps. 133:1-3; 2 Cor. 6: 11-13) So allow time to associate with old friends and to make new ones. If a visiting speaker such as a district overseer or a brother from Bethel has been assigned to your special assembly day, why not take the opportunity to welcome him and his wife?

<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Emphasize Starting Bible Studies on the First Saturday</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Beginning in May of 2011, publishers were encouraged to try to start Bible studies on the first Saturday of each month. To help us do that, a regular feature of the public edition of The Watchtower entitled “Bible Questions Answered” has been prepared. Therefore, the meeting for field service held on the first Saturday should highlight how this feature can be used to start Bible studies and should include a demonstration of a presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The elders can choose to have each field service group meet separately on the first Saturday, or they can decide to have the groups combine and perhaps meet at the Kingdom Hall. However, if multiple congregations use the Kingdom Hall, no congregation should move this special day for starting Bible studies to another day in order to have a combined meeting for field service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Announcing Jehovah's Kingdom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We’re visiting because many in our community wonder why God has allowed so much suffering. Have you ever wondered about that? [Allow for response.] It’s interesting that the Bible promises that there will be a time when mourning and pain will be gone. [Read Revelation 21:4.] This magazine examines five fundamental reasons why there is so much suffering. It also shows what the Bible says about how God will end suffering.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“We’re here to provide information regarding a popular holiday that’s approaching —Halloween. Some have chosen not to celebrate, pointing to warnings such as this one from the Bible. [Read Leviticus 19:31.] Other people do not believe in supernatural spirits and view Halloween as harmless fun. What’s your opinion about this holiday? [Allow for response.] This magazine reveals the dark origins of Halloween.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Field Service Highlights</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When comparing the first six months of this service year with the same period the previous year, the number of regular pioneers increased by 8.8 percent in the Bahamas and by 7.3 percent in the United States. Also during this same period, the number of return visits increased by 6.8 percent in Bermuda and by 13.4 percent in the Turks and Caicos Islands. We rejoice that Jehovah’s servants take seriously their responsibility of ‘watering’ seeds of Kingdom truth.—1 Cor. 3:6.</span></p>

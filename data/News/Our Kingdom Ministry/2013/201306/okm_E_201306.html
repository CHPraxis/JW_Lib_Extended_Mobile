<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Are You Willing to Adapt?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> At 1 Corinthians 7:31, the Bible compares the world to a stage with ever-changing scenes and actors. Changes in the world require that we make adjustments from time to time in our preaching methods, our schedule, and </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">our a</span><span class="font9">pproach. Are you willing to adapt?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Changes in the world require that we make what adjustments?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Your Preaching Methods: The Christian congregation has always been adaptable. When Jesus initially sent out his disciples, he told them not to procure a food pouch or money for their purses. (Matt. 10:9, 10) However, he later revised those instructions in anticipation of future hostility toward his disciples and the expansion of the preaching work into other territories. (Luke 22:36) Over the past century, Jehovah’s organization has used different preaching methods—testi-mony cards, radio broadcasts, and sound cars, for example—according to what was needed at the time. Today, since people in many areas are seldom at home, increased emphasis has been placed on supplementing our house-to-house ministry with public and informal witnessing. We have also been encouraged to go from house to house during the early evening if people are at work during the day. As Jehovah’s celestial chariot adjusts its course, are you keeping pace with it?—Ezek. 1: 20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Your Presentation: What are the people in your area presently concerned about? The economy? Family? War? It is beneficial to be aware of the current problems and circumstances common in our territory so that we can prepare an appropriate presentation. (1 Cor. 9:20-23) When householders express themselves, rather than giving a token response and continuing with our prepared presentation, how much better it is to adapt and address their concerns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Very soon this world’s final “scene” will conclude, and the great tribulation will begin. “The time left is reduced.” (1 Cor. 7:29) How important it is, then, to adapt and to do so without delay, so that we can accomplish the most in the limited time left!</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">2. Why must we be adaptable in order to keep pace with the organization?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">3. How does being adaptable help us to be more effective in our territory?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">Song 9 and Prayer</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Increased Opportunities to Laud Jehovah</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> This past March, a new arrangement went into effect, giving publishers the opportunity to auxiliary pioneer with a 30-hour requirement each March and April and during the month of the circuit overseer’s regular vis</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">it. If</span><span class="font9"> the visit of the circuit overseer spans</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What new arrangement will help us to “laud Jehovah very much”?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">two months, publishers who apply for the 30-hour requirement may choose one month or the other to auxiliary pioneer. All auxiliary pioneers may attend the entire meeting that he has with the regular and special pioneers. This means that if the 50-hour requirement is out of reach for us, we can still “laud Jehovah very much” as auxiliary pioneers up to four times a year with the 30-hour require-ment!—Ps. 109:30; 119:171.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> During the Ci rcuit Overseer’s Visit: Now many more will be able to auxiliary pioneer during the visit of the circuit overseer and enjoy the interchange of encouragement that comes from working with him in the ministry. (Rom. 1:11, 12) Many auxiliary pioneers will likely arrange to take a day off during the week in order to work with the circuit overseer. Those who work secularly during weekdays can ask him if he will work with them on Saturday or Sunday. In addition, how encouraging it will be for the auxiliary pioneers to attend the pioneer meeting along with the regular and special pioneers!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> During March and April: Those who took advantage of the former arrangement to auxiliary pioneer with the 30-hour requirement one month during the Memorial season can now double their “sacrifice of praise”! (Heb. 13:15) Both March and April are excellent months to expand our ministry as auxiliary pioneers. Each year during those months, we participate in an enjoyable campaign to invite others to attend the Memorial. In addition, because many expand their ministry during the Memorial season, we can work with a variety of publishers. After the Memorial, we follow up on the interest shown by those who attended and build enthusiasm for the special public talk. Will your heart motivate you to take advantage of these additional opportunities to auxiliary pioneer?—Luke 6:45.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Feature One Topic, but Leave Both Magazines</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Each set of our magazines contains a variety of interesting topics. Rather than trying to feature several subjects at each door, it is generally better to discuss only one. If we are observant and familiar with the contents of the magazines, we can choose something from either The Watchtower or Awake! that will interest the householder. For example, if we see children’s toys in or around the home, we may choose to highlight an article on family life. If a man comes to the door, we might decide to feature a subject that many men are interested in, such as good government. Although we may discuss only one topic, we should usually leave both magazines with the householder if he shows interest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">We are happy to report two new all-time peaks in regular pioneers during the month of December 2012: 154,706 in the United States and 79 in Bermuda. Also, when comparing December with the same month of the previous year, the number of Bible studies being conducted increased by 5.9 percent in the Bahamas and by 15.6 percent in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Clearly, Jehovah’s servants are making a “sacrifice of praise” to him.—Heb. 13:15.</span></p>

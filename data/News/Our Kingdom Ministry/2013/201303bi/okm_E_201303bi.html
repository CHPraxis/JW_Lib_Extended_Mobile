<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The Memorial on Tuesday, March 26, provides an excellent opportunity to rejoice in God’s means of salvation. (Isa. </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">61:10</span><span class="font10">) Even before the upcoming obser-</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font9"> Preparing for the Observance: </span><span class="font10">The Lord’s Evening Meal is a profound yet simple observance. Still, it requires advance planning so that important details are not overlooked. (Prov. 21:5) The time and a suitable location must be selected. The proper emblems need to be obtained. The meeting place has to be cleaned and readied. The designated speaker needs to prepare carefully, and the servers and attendants must be organized. No doubt much of this has already been done. Gratitude for the saving power of the ransom moves us to prepare well for this sacred occasion.—1 Pet. 1:8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font9"> Preparing the Heart: </span><span class="font10">It is also essential to prepare our heart to appreciate the full significance of the Memorial. (Ezra 7: 10) To that end, we should set aside time to consider the special Memorial Bible reading and then ponder the final days of Jesus’ earthly life. Meditating on Jesus’ self-sacrificing spirit will motivate us to imitate him.—Gal. 2:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Christ’s death vindicates Jehovah’s sovereignty. It gives release from sin and death. (1 John 2:2) It opens the way for peaceful relations with God and the way to eternal life. (Col. 1:21, 22) It also helps us to strengthen our resolve to live up to our dedication to Jehovah and remain firm as Christ’s disciples. (Matt. 16:24) As you prepare for and attend the upcoming </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Mem</span><span class="font10">orial, may your joy be increased!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">Welcome Them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> No occasion offers us a better opportunity to give a witness than the annual Memorial observance. Consider: This year over ten million visitors are expected to attend the Memorial and hear about the two greatest expressions of love, which were manifested by the ransom. (John 3:16; 15: 13) They will learn about the blessings available to them because of Jehovah’s gift. (Isa. 65:21-23) However, the speaker is not the only one who will give a witness on this occasion. All in attendance will have</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">1. What occasion offers us an excellent opportunity to give a witness, and why? </span><span class="font10">the opportunity to give a powerful witness by warmly welcoming the visitors.—Rom. 15:7.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Rather than just finding your seat and silently waiting for the program to begin, why not take the initiative to introduce yourself to those nearby? Visitors may be nervous and unsure of what to expect. Our warm smile and friendly greeting will go a long way toward putting them at ease. To find out if someone is present as a result of receiving an invitation, you might ask if this is his first time attending one of our meetings or if he knows anyone in the congregation. Perhaps you can invite him to sit with you and share your Bible and songbook. If a Kingdom Hall is being used, it may be possible to give him a brief tour. After the talk, make yourself available to answer his questions. If your congregation must leave quickly to make room for another congregation, you might say: “I’d like to hear what you thought of the program. Is there a way that I can contact you?” Then make arrangements to follow up on the interest. Elders will especially want to be alert to encourage inactive publishers who attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> For many visitors, this will be their first taste of the joy, peace, and unity of the spiritual paradise that we enjoy as Jehovah’s people. (Ps. 29:11; Isa. 11:6-9; 65:13, 14) What impression will visitors take away? Much will depend on our taking the initiative to welcome them.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark5"></a>New Brochure Designed to Direct Bible Students to the Organization</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Have you started using the new brochure Who Are Doing Jehovah’s Will Today? Its purpose is (1) to familiarize Bible students with us as a people, (2) to help them learn about our activities, and (3) to show them our organization in action. The Jehovah’s Will brochure contains one-page lessons that can easily be covered in just five to ten minutes at the end of each study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> How It Is Designed: </span><span class="font11">The brochure is divided into three sections, each of which discusses a different aspect of Jehovah’s organization, as noted above. The title of each of the 28 lessons is written as a question, and the bold subheadings that follow answer that question. Photographs from over 50 countries are labeled throughout to show the international scope of our work. A number of lessons have “Find Out More” boxes, which contain suggestions that you can encourage your student to pursue.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> How You Can Use It: </span><span class="font11">Start by calling attention to the question that is the title of the lesson. Then, as you read the lesson together, highlight the bold subheadings. Finally, consid</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">er th</span><span class="font11">e review questions at the bottom</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">of the page. You can read the lesson straight through or read and discuss it in sections. Use your judgment in deciding which cited scriptures to read. Do not forget to consider the pictures and the “Find Out More” boxes. In most cases, the lessons should be discussed in order. However, feel free to jump ahead to a lesson that deals with something of immediate interest. For example, if an assembly or a convention is coming up, you could skip to lesson 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When we study the Bible with someone, we help him to get acquainted with our heavenly Father. However, we also need to teach him about Jehovah’s organization. (Prov. 6:20) How happy we are to have this new tool </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">that</span><span class="font11"> makes it easy to do so!</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> During the “Safeguard Your Heart!” District Convention, we were excited to receive a new brochure to help us make return visits and start Bible studies. Good News From God! is similar to the Require brochure, which it replaces, in that the lessons are concise. This lends itself to using the brochure for doorstep Bible studies. However, while the Require brochure discussed Christian requirements, which can be challenging for new students to accept, this new brochure focuses on the good news found in the Bible.—Acts 15:35.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11">Bible Teach book, our primary tool for Bible studies. People who are intimidated by a book are often more willing to study the Bible using a brochure. In addition, a brochure is more easily translated into a large number of languages.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font10">How It Is Designed: </span><span class="font11">Many of our </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">stud</span><span class="font11">y publications are written so that a</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">3. How is this brochure different from other study publications? </span><span class="font11">person can read it and understand the truth, even without help. This publication is different. It is written as a guide for Bible study with an instructor. Therefore, when offering it to someone, it is best to discuss a paragraph or two. The paragraphs are short, so they can even be considered at a person’s doorstep or his place of business. While lesson 1 is a good place to begin, we can start a study almost anywhere in the brochure.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> In many of our publications, the answers to the printed questions can be found in the paragraphs. However, in this publication, the answers are found mainly in the Bible. Most people want to learn from the Bible rather than from our literature. Therefore, almost none of the cited scriptures are quoted. They are to be read from the Bible itself. This helps students realize that what they are learning comes from God.—Isa. 54:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The brochure does not explain all the scriptures. Why? It is designed to encourage the student to ask questions and to allow the instructor to use his teaching ability. Therefore, it is important to be well-prepared for each study period. A word of caution: Do not talk too much. We love to explain the Scriptures. But we often accomplish more by inviting the student to explain what he thinks the scripture means. By using questions tactfully, we can help him to reason out the meaning of each text. —Acts 17:2.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Like other publications for conducting studies, this brochure can be offered at any time, regardless of what is being featured for the month. Many will enjoy using it with the direct approach to start doorstep studies. In addition, as mentioned at the district convention, using it when calling back on those who showed interest “can really make the return visit work exciting!” —See the boxes on pages 5-7.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font10"> How to Conduct the Study: </span><span class="font11">We could begin the discussion by reading the numbered question in bold print.

<p><span class="font15">• </span><span class="font5">In some areas, publishers find that the words “God” and “Bible” are conversation stoppers. In that case, on the initial visit, it may be best to discuss topics that are of local concern, such as the need for good government, where to get practical help for families, and what the future holds. Perhaps the Good </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font5"> brochure can be introduced after we have had several conversations considering how we know that God exists and why the Bible is trustworthy. </span><span class="font11">ask the householder to answer the question in bold print, to make sure he understands. For the first few visits, it may be best to consider just one of the questions in bold print. In time, we may be able to lengthen the discussions to include an entire lesson.</span></p>

Have you ever wondered whether God will relieve us of suffering? [Allow for response.] This brochure shows where in the Bible you can find the answer to that question. [Hand him a brochure, and read the first paragraph in lesson 1, as well as Jeremiah 29: 11.] From this, does it seem reasonable to you that God wants us to have a better future?

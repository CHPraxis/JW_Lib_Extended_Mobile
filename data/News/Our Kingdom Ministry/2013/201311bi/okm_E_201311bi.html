<p><span class="font7">Song 113 and Prayer</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Take as a Pattern the Prophets —Hosea</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> ‘What sacrifices am I willing to make for Jehovah?’ Perhaps you have asked yourself that question when meditating on his abundant goodness and mercy. (Ps. 103:2-4; 116: 12) Hosea willingly did what Jehovah commanded him to do, even though it required personal sacrifice. How can we imitate Hosea?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">1. What question may you have asked yourself?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Preach in Troublesome Season: Hosea’s message was directed primarily toward the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel, where true worship had nearly been stamped out. King Jeroboam II did what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes and perpetuated the calf worship initiated by Jeroboam I. (2 Ki. 14:23, 24) The succeeding kings continued the spiritual decline of the ten-tribe kingdom until it was finally destroyed in 740 B.C.E. Yet, in spite of the prevailing false worship, Hosea faithfully served as a prophet for at least 59 years. Are we similarly determined to preach year after year, even when facing apathy or opposition? —2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Focus on Jehovah’s Mercy: Jehovah instructed Hosea to marry “a wife of fornication.” (Hos. 1:2) Although his wife, Gomer, bore him a son, she apparently later gave birth to two illegitimate children. Hosea’s willingness to forgive his wife illustrated Jehovah’s great mercy toward wayward Israel when they repented. (Hos. 3:1; Rom. 9:22-26) Are we willing to put aside personal preference in order to make known Jehovah’s mercy to people of all sorts?—1 Cor. 9:19-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Some servants of Jehovah have sacrificed lucrative careers in order to devote more time to the ministry. Others have remained single or childless to pursue Kingdom interests. When reflecting on the life of Hosea, we may think to ourselves, ‘I could never do what he did.’ However, as we grow in appreciation for Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and rely upon his holy spirit for strength, we may be used by him in ways we never thought possible, just as Hosea was.—Matt. 19:26; Phil. 2:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">2. How can we imitate Hosea’s fine example of persevering in the preaching work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">3. How did Hosea’s life illustrate Jehovah’ s mercy?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">4. What are some sacrifices that we might make for Jehovah?</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>QUESTION BOX</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">■ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Should a female publisher wear a head covering if she is accompanied by a male publisher at a doorstep Bible study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When a female publisher conducts a regular, scheduled Bible study and a male Kingdom publisher is present, she should wear a head covering. (1 Cor. 11:3-10) The July 15, 2002, issue of The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font8"> page 27, explains: “This is a prearranged session of teaching where the one conducting the study actually presides. Under these circumstances, a study becomes an extension of the congregation. If a baptized female Witness conducts such a study with a baptized male Witness present, she would rightly wear a head covering.” This is true whether the study is conducted in a home, at the doorstep, or in some other setting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the other hand, if a doorstep Bible study has not yet been established, a sister would not need to wear a head covering in the presence of a male Kingdom publisher, even if the purpose of the return visit is to demonstrate a Bible study or to consider material in one of the recommended study publications. Since doorstep studies are often established gradually, through a series of progressive return visits, publishers will need to consider the circumstances and be reasonable in determining at what point a head covering should be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I Am Here Because . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When householders open their door and see us standing there, they may wonder who we are and why we are there. What could we say in our introduction to put their mind at ease? After giving the customary greeting, some publishers use the word “because”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to explain. For example, they may say: “We are visiting </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">because</span><span class="font7"> many neighbors are concerned about crime. Do you think . . .” or “I am here </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">because</span><span class="font7"> I give Bible lessons free of charge.” If in the very beginning the householder is told </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font7"> you are there, he may be more inclined to listen to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font7"> you have to say.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>A Helpful Series for Our Ministry</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> From time to time, the public edition of The Watchtower features the series “A Conversation With a Neighbor.” This series has a twofold objective—to present Bible teachings </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">in an</span><span class="font7"> appealing way and to show us how we</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. The series “A Conversation With a Neighbor” has what twofold objective? might reason tactfully on certain subjects. (1 Pet. 3:15) How can we make good use of these articles?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Use Them in the Ministry: You might save extra copies of issues of The Watchtower that include an article from this series. When a householder, interested person, or Bible student asks a question or raises an objection that has been addressed in one of these articles, give him a copy of that article and offer to discuss it. If you do not have a printed copy of the magazine that featured the article, perhaps you can download it from jw.org.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> How might you discuss one of these articles with someone? Some have invited the person to read aloud the words of the neighbor, while they read the words of the Witness. This third-person approach can be effective because it allows the individual to examine our beliefs in a way that does not make him feel uneasy.—Deut. 32:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Train Yourself and Others: As you read through these articles, take note of the scriptures, illustrations, and lines of reasoning. Notice the tone of the material. Then try a similar approach in your ministry. (Prov. 1:5; 9:9) One sister observed, “Reading these articles is like learning from a ‘perfect’ pioneer partner—one who always knows just the right thing to say!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> You can also use these scripted examples to help your Bible students prepare for the ministry. Read the information together, allowing the student to play the role of the publisher. In this way, Bible students can practice expressing their beliefs in a tactful manner. (Col. 4:6) Truly, these articles are one of the many ways that Jehovah helps us </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">“fully</span><span class="font7"> accomplish” our ministry.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">2. How can we use this series of articles in our ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">3. How might we discuss one of the articles with a householder?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">4. How can we use the articles in this series to train ourselves?</span></p></li>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Take as a Pattern the Prophets —Jonah</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What comes to mind when you think of the prophet Jonah? Some may view him as cowardly or hard-hearted. However, he clearly manifested humility, courage, and a spirit of self-sacrifice. How can we “take as a pat</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">tern”</span><span class="font11"> Jonah’s admirable qualities?—Jas. 5:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1. What positive qualities did Jonah possess?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font10"> Humility: </span><span class="font11">Initially, Jonah fled in the opposite direction of his assigned territory. This is not surprising because the Assyrians were notoriously violent, and Nineveh came to be called “the city of bloodshed.” (Nah. 3:1-3) Nonetheless, Jehovah disciplined Jonah, who showed humility by accepting the assignment when given a second chance. (Prov. 24:32; Jonah 3:1-3) Despite his initial reluctance, he did Jehovah’s will. (Matt. 21:28-31) Are we similarly determined to preach the good news, even if we are disciplined or have a challenging territory assignment?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font10"> Courage and Self-Sacrifice: </span><span class="font11">When Jonah realized that his bad decision had jeopardized the lives of the mariners, he was willing to sacrifice his life. (Jonah 1:3, 4, 12) Later, when fulfilling his commission in Nineveh, he walked deep into the heart of the city, perhaps looking for a suitable location to proclaim the judgment of Jehovah. Those were the actions, not of a coward, but of a courageous prophet of God! (Jonah 3:3, 4) What about us today? Godgiven courage is needed to give a bold witness in the face of opposition. (Acts 4:29, 31) Self-sacrifice is required to invest time and resources in the ministry.—Acts 20:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Each time you read an account about one of Jehovah’s prophets, you will benefit if you visualize yourself in those circumstances. Ask yourself: ‘How would I have responded? How can I imitate his good qualities in my life?’ (Heb. 6:11, 12) Future articles in Our Kingdom Ministry will consider further valuable lessons that we can learn from oth</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">er fai</span><span class="font11">thful prophets of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">2. How can we imitate Jonah’s humility?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. What aspects of your ministry require courage and self-sacrifice?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. Why should we take time to reflect on the fine pattern set by the prophets of Jehovah?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTION BOX</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">What Bible principlesapply tothe use of cell phones while attending Christian meetingsand sharing in the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“For Everything There Is an Appointed Time.” (Eccl. 3:1): </span><span class="font10">Cell phones give people the ability to text or speak with one another at virtually any time. However, there are occasions when Christians do not want to be distracted by their phone. For instance, our meetings are a time to worship Jehovah, receive spiritual instruction, and enjoy an interchange of encouragement. (Deut. 31:12; Ps. 22:22; Rom. 1: 11, 12) Could we turn off our phone when we arrive and retrieve our messages after leaving the meeting? If the possibility of an emergency requires that we leave our phone on, we should put it on a setting that will not disturb others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Do All Things for the Sake of the Good News.” (1 Cor. 9:23): </span><span class="font10">At times, there are valid uses of a cell phone in the ministry. For example, a brother taking the lead might use it to check on those preaching in other parts of the territory. Publishers sometimes use their cell phone to call an interested person or Bible student before making a visit, especially if the person lives some distance away. If we have a phone with us, we should take precautions to prevent it from interrupting us while we are speaking with a householder. (2 Cor. 6:3) While waiting on other publishers, rather than phoning or texting a friend, would it not be better to keep our attention focused on the ministry and those with whom we are working?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Considerate of Others. (1 Cor. 10: 24; Phil. 2:4): </span><span class="font10">Never would we want to be lax about being on time for the meetings for field service with the idea that we can always phone or text someone to find out where the group is witnessing. When we arrive late, the group must often be reorganized. Of course, circumstances beyond our control may occasionally cause us to be late. However, when we make it a habit to arrive on time, we show consideration for Jehovah’s arrangement, the brother taking the lead, and our fellow publishers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Program Times: </span><span class="font10">The doors to the building will open at 8:00 a.m. The introductory music will begin at 9:20 a.m. all three days. At that time, all of us should go to our seats so that the program can begin in a dignified manner. The closing song and prayer will be introduced at 4:50 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and at 3:35 p.m. on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Parking: </span><span class="font10">At all convention sites where we control the parking, the spaces will be available to attendees at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. Parking is usually limited, so carpooling should be done to the extent possible. Only those with a license plate or placard for the disabled will be allowed to park in the area reserved for such ones.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Soon the 2013 district conventions will begin. Much work has gone into preparing a program that addresses the current needs of the worldwide field. Have you made arrangements to be present all three days of the convention? Large conventions can have many distractions, so extra effort may be needed to pay careful attention to the program. Since the sessions last longer than congregation meetings, concentration must be maintained longer. In addition, travel and other factors may cause a measure of tiredness. What will help us to remain alert so that we can listen and learn?—Deut. 31:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Before the Convention Begins: </span><span class="font10">Our official Web site, </span><a href="http://www.jw.org"><span class="font10">www.jw.org</span></a><span class="font10">, posts the convention program, which includes the titles of all the talks and one or two key scriptures for each one. If we have access to the Internet, previewing this information will help us</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. Why may extra effort be required to listen and learn at the district convention?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. How may we prepare our heart for the convention program?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">vehicle or for your current Bible students. Seating for the elderly and the infirm is limited, so it may not be possible for all of their family members to sit with them. Please leave these seats for the elderly and the infirm and those assisting them.—1 Cor. 13:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Noon Meal: </span><span class="font10">Please bring a light lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers and glass containers are not permitted in the convention facility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Donations: </span><span class="font10">We can show our appreciation for the convention arrangements by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at the convention. Any checks should be made payable to “Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Donations can also be made by means of a debit or credit card. to prepare our heart for what will be presented. (Ezra 7:10) During your Family Worship evening, could you devote time to building anticipation for the upcoming program?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">During the Program: </span><span class="font10">If possible, care for restroom needs before the start of the session. Turn off your cell phone so that you will not be distracted by calls or texts or be tempted to text others during the program. If you must have your phone on, put it on a setting that will not distract others in the event that someone calls. If you use an electronic tablet during the program, do so in a way that is not distracting to others. Avoid eating or drinking during the program. (Eccl. 3:1) Keep your eyes focused on the speaker. When a scripture is read, follow along in your Bible. Take brief notes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> We also want our children to listen and learn. Proverbs 29:15 says: “A boy let on the loose will be causing his mother shame.” Therefore, it is good for families to sit together so that parents can make sure that their children are paying attention to the program rather than talking, texting, or walk</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing a</span><span class="font10">round. Even if they are too young to</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. How can parents help their children to listen and learn?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Medication: </span><span class="font10">If you require prescription medication, please be sure to bring an adequate supply with you, since none will be available at the convention. Diabetic syringes and needles must be disposed of properly as hazardous waste and not in trash receptacles at the convention facility or hotel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Footwear: </span><span class="font10">Each year injuries occur that are related to footwear, especially high-heeled shoes. It is best to choose modest, well-fitting shoes that will allow you to walk safely on ramps, stairs, gratings, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Hearing Impaired: </span><span class="font10">The program will be broadcast in the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. To receive it, you will need to bring a small battery-operated FM receiver and earphones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">understand everything that is discussed, children can be trained to remain awake and sit quietly.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Afte r the Program Concludes Each Day: </span><span class="font10">Do not stay out late. Go to bed early enough to get sufficient rest. Reviewing what you heard will help you to remember it longer. Therefore, it would be beneficial to take a few minutes to discuss the program as a family each evening. If you go to a restaurant with friends, why not take your notes along and share a point or two that you especially enjoyed? When you return home after the convention, you might spend some time during your Family Worship evening discussing how you can apply the information as a family. You could also set aside time each week to review a portion of any new releases.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> A banquet serves little purpose unless the food is eaten and digested. We can say the same regarding the spiritual banquet that will be served at the district convention. May we benefit fully by being in attendance for each session, by listening carefully, and by applying what we learn.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">5. Why is it beneficial to review the program, and how may we do this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">6. Is merely being present at the convention sufficient? Explain.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Baby Strollers and Lawn Chairs: </span><span class="font10">Baby strollers and lawn chairs should not be brought to the convention site. However, child-safety seats are acceptable if they can be secured in a seat next to the parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Fragrances: </span><span class="font10">Most conventions take place in enclosed areas with mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be loving on our part to limit the use of strong fragrances, colognes, and perfumes that may cause reactions in people with respiratory or related problems. —1 Cor. 10:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font10">Please Follow Up </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(S-43) Forms: </span><span class="font10">A Please Follow Up form should be used to provide information regarding any interest found through informal witnessing during the convention. Completed forms may be submitted</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark9"></a>A Campaign That Gets Results</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">Three weeks before the start of their convention, congregations will once again participate in a campaign to invite interested ones from the territory to attend. There is good reason for this annual campaign. Those who accept the invitation and come to the convention are often impressed by the Scriptural talks, the well-organized departments manned entirely by volunteers, and the good conduct and unity we display. (Ps. 110:3; 133:1; Isa. 65:13, 14) Even so, does our campaign get results, especially in areas where interested ones must travel some distance to attend the convention?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">After the 2011 district convention, a branch office received a letter from a woman who had found an invitation in her door. She usually hid when Jehovah’s Witnesses knocked. She wrote: “I had a beautiful home, a wonderful husband, and I thought I had everything that would make me happy. Sadly, I was still not happy, and my life truly had no purpose.

<p><span class="font10">(2) Do not cancel your reservation except for an emergency situation, and notify the hotel as soon as it occurs so that others needing accommodations can use the room.

<p><span class="font11">Some who receive an invitation will attend. Therefore, have a zealous share in this important campaign. Bring any leftover invitations with you to the convention city, and use them to witness informally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How Will We Offer the Invitation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In order to cover our territory, we should be brief. We might say something like this: “Hello. We are sharing in a global effort to distribute this invitation. Here is your copy. You will find more details on the invitation.” Be enthusiastic. When sharing in the campaign on the weekends, we should also offer the magazines when appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If you cancel a room less than 48 hours ahead of time, your deposit will not be refunded.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(3) Please note that if you use a debit or credit card when registering at a hotel, it is standard practice for the hotel to place a “hold” on funds in your account to cover your total room cost, plus any possible damages or incidentals during your stay. You will not be able to use any of those funds until your account is settled within a few days after you depart.</span></p></li>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Conduct That Glorifies God</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When attending district conventions, we are quite conspicuous. In many convention cities, local news outlets inform the community of our presence. The hotels and restaurants are often filled with delegates, and people living in the area notice the many visitors wearing convention badges. The following are some reminders that will help us to glorify God by our good conduct while in the convention city.—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Modest Dress: </span><span class="font10">Our modest dress while attending the program often impresses onlookers. However, our style of dress at other times—when checking in at the hotel, when eating at area restaurants, when shopping, and so forth—may make a bigger impression on observers. Although we need not wear dress clothes on these other occasions, what we wear should be modest, dignified, and not overly casual. Observers should be able to see a difference between us and unbelievers. (Rom. 12:2) In addition, we should wear our convention badge, as this will advertise </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">the c</span><span class="font10">onvention, lead to witnessing opportu-</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(6) Cook only in rooms where cooking is permitted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(7) Do not abuse any complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice provisions that are made available for guests to consume while they are at the hotel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(8) At all times, display the fruitage of the spirit when dealing with the hotel staff. They are caring for a large number of guests and appreciate our kindness, patience, and reasonableness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(9) Parents should supervise their children at all times around the hotel, including the elevators, swimming pool, lobby area, exercise room, and so forth. nities, and enable other delegates to identify us.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Patience and Courtesy: </span><span class="font10">At a time when many in the world are self-centered and unthankful, how refreshing our patience and courteousness will be to onlookers, such as hotel and restaurant personnel! (2 Tim. 3: 1-5) When saving seats or when getting in line to obtain convention releases, we should seek, not our own advantage, but that of the other person. (1 Cor. 10:23, 24) After attending his first convention, one interested man said, “I don’t remember any of the talks that were given that day, but the conduct of the Witnesses made a lasting impression on me.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Willing Volunteers: </span><span class="font10">The volunteer spirit is a mark of true Christians. (Ps. 110:3) Could you volunteer to assist at the convention? At one convention site, some 600 brothers and sisters volunteered to clean before the convention. The staff remarked: “This is the most amazing thing we have ever seen! It’s hard to imagine that all of these people are volunteers.” We eagerly look forward to the 2013 district conventions and the opportunity we will have not just to listen and learn from </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">God </span><span class="font10">but also to glorify him.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">3. How may we display patience and courtesy? 4. Why should we consider volunteering at the convention if our circumstances allow?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(10) The room rate shown on the Recommended Lodging List is the full price per day, excluding tax. If you are overcharged, refuse these charges and inform the Rooming Department at the convention as soon as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(11) If a problem arises with your hotel room, inform the Rooming Department while at the convention so that they can assist you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Service: </span><span class="font10">Any who wish to volunteer should report to the Volunteer Service Department at the convention. Children under 16 years of age can also make a fine contribution by working under the direction of a parent, guardian, or other adult approved by a parent or guardian.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Do You Regularly Check the Information Board?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Elders, ministerial servants, and others who have congregation responsibilities regularly look at the information board to see when they have an assignment. However, all in the congregation will find important information there. Do you know when it is your turn to clean the Kingdom Hall? Has the circuit overseer or branch office sent important correspondence to the congregation? Do you know the title of the public talk this week so that you can invite your Bible student? Have adjustments been made to the meeting schedule or in your field service group? Much of this information is no longer announced during the meetings, and it may not be possible for the elders to convey it to every publisher individually. Thus, we should check the information board regularly. If we keep ourselves informed, then all things can take place “decently and by arrangement.”—1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p>

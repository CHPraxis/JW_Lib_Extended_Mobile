<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Who was the prophet Joel? He reveals only that he was “the son of Pethuel.” (Joel </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">1:1) </span><span class="font11">This humble prophet emphasized Je-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. How can we imitate Joel’s humility as we preach?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">hovah’s message, not his own role as the messenger. Likewise, in our ministry, rather than seeking personal praise or recognition, we direct attention to Jehovah and the Bible. (1 Cor. 9:16; 2 Cor. 3:5) In addition, we find strength in the message we declare. What aspects of Joel’s prophecy can infuse us with zeal and hope today?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> “The Day of Jehovah Is Near.” (Joel 1: 15): Although these words were written millenniums ago, we are living in the time of their final fulfillment. Deteriorating world conditions and the indifference and ridicule that we encounter in our territory are positive proofs that the last days of this wicked system of things have arrived. (2 Tim. 3:1-5; 2 Pet. 3: 3, 4) When we contemplate the nearness of the end, we have every reason to give the ministry priority in our lives.—2 Pet. 3:11, 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> “Jehovah Will Be a Refuge for His People.” (Joel 3:16): The rocking described in this verse could apply only to Jehovah’s execution of judgment during the great tribulation. We take comfort in knowing that Jehovah will deliver his faithful servants during that time. (Rev. 7:9, 14) As we engage in the preaching work and experience how Jehovah sustains and strengthens us, we build faith and endurance that will help us during the coming great tribulation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Although Joel’s message has been described by some as one of gloom, it offers God’s people the glorious hope of deliverance. (Joel 2:32) Let us, then, face the future with confidence and zealously proclaim the good news of God’s Kingdom as we heed the words of Joel 2:23: “Be joyful and rejoice in Je</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">hova</span><span class="font11">h your God.”</span></p></li></ul>

(Luke 24:32) </span><span class="font11">Discussion based on these questions: (1) When conducting a Bible study, why is it important to emphasize (a) Jehovah’s love and wisdom? (b) the value of applying Bible principles? (c) the need always to seek Jehovah’s direction before making a decision? (2) How would asking your student the following questions help you discern if you are reaching his heart? (a) Does this sound reasonable to you? (b) Do you feel that this is consistent with God’s love? (c) What benefit do you see in applying such counsel?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: “Young Brothers, Are You Reaching Out?” </span><span class="font11">Questions and answers. Briefly interview an elder or a ministerial servant who reached out as a young person. What assignments and training did he receive before he was appointed as a ministerial servant? How did others in the congregation help him make spiritual progress? What blessings has he enjoyed as a result of reaching out?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 85 and Prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Young Brothers, Are You Reaching Out?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “If any man is reaching out . . . , he is desirous of a fine work.” (1 Tim. 3:1) Those inspired words encourage brothers to reach out to qualify for service privileges in the congregation. Must you be an adult to do so? Actually, it is best to begin reaching out when you are still a youth. In this way you can receive training and demonstrate your fitness to be appointed as a ministerial servant when you are older. (1 Tim. 3:10) If you are a young baptized brother, how can you reach out?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Self-Sacrifice: Remember that you are reaching out for a fine work, not a title. Therefore, cultivate a desire to help your brothers and sisters. One way to do this is by meditating on Jesus’ fine example. (Matt. 20:28; John 4:6, 7; 13:4, 5) Ask Jehovah to help you to be interested in others. (1 Cor. 10:24) Could you give practical assistance to those in the congregation who are elderly or infirm? Do you make yourself available to cut the grass, shovel the snow, or care for other aspects of maintaining the Kingdom Hall? Could you volunteer to give a sub</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">stitu</span><span class="font12">te talk on the Theocratic Ministry</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">1. When should a young brother begin to apply the direction found at 1 Timothy 3:1?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. How can the spirit of self-sacrifice be cultivated and demonstrated?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">With so many new ones coming into the truth, qualified spiritual men are needed to care for congregation responsibilities</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Spirituality: It is far more important for a servant in the congregation to have spirituality than to have special talents or natural abilities. A spiritual man tries to view things as Jehovah and Jesus do. (1 Cor. 2:15, 16) He displays “the fruitage of the spirit.” (Gal. 5:22, 23) He is a zealous evangelizer who puts Kingdom interests first. (Matt. 6:33) You can develop spiritual qualities by having a good routine of personal study. This would include reading the Bible every day, reading each issue of The Watchtower and Awake!, and preparing for and attending congregation meetings. (Ps. 1:1, 2; Heb. 10:24, 25) When encouraging young Timothy to make spiritual advancement, Paul wrote: “Pay constant attention to . . . your teaching.” (1 Tim. 4:15, 16) So work hard on your talk assignments in the Theocratic Ministry School. Prepare for the ministry, and share in it regularly. Set and work toward spiritual goals, such as pioneering, Bethel service, or attending the Bible School for Single Brothers. Spirituality will help you to “flee from the desires incidental to youth.”—2 Tim. 2:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Reliability and Faithfulness: Because the brothers who were assigned to distribute food to needy Christians in the first century were “certified,” evidently known for being reliable and faithful, the apostles did not have to worry about whether the work would be done. This allowed them to focus on other important matters. (Acts 6:1-4) Therefore, when you are given an assignment in the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">cong</span><span class="font12">regation, carry it out to the best of</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">3. How important is spirituality, and how can it be developed?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">4. What is the value of reliability and faithfulness?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">your ability. Imitate Noah, who carefully followed the instructions he was given to build the ark. (Gen. 6:22) Faithfulness is valued by Jehovah and demonstrates spiritual maturity.— 1 Cor. 4:2; see the box “The Benefits of Training.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> As prophesied, Jehovah is speeding up the ingathering. (Isa. 60:22) On average, a quarter of a million people are getting baptized each year. With so many new ones coming into the truth, qualified spiritual men are needed to care for congregation responsibilities. Now more than ever, there is plenty of work to do in Jehovah’s service. (1 Cor. 15:58) Young brothers, are you reaching out? If so, you </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">are d</span><span class="font12">esirous of a very fine work indeed!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">5. Why should young brothers reach out?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The Benefits of Training</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Qualified young brothers benefit when elders give them assignments and train them. A circuit overseer was sitting on the platform giving encouragement to a publisher after the meeting. He noticed a young boy standing nearby, so he asked if he was waiting to speak to him. The young brother replied that he was assigned to vacuum the platform after every meeting. His parents were ready to leave, but he did not want to go before he fulfilled his assignment. The circuit overseer gladly moved. He commented: “The elders in that congregation were alert to train qualified young brothers by giving them congregation assignments. As a result, it was not unusual for them to recommend a young brother as a ministerial servant when I served the congregation.”</span></p>

Song 95 and Prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">New Initiatives for Public Witnessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> First-century Christians did more than preach from house to house. They also preached publicly. (Acts 20:20) For example, they went to the temple, where they knew many people could be found. (Acts 5:42) </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Whe</span><span class="font11">n in Athens, the apostle Paul preached</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. What example did first-century Christians set? every day to those on hand in the marketplace. (Acts 17:17) Today, our primary way of spreading the good news continues to be the house-to-house ministry. However, we also go to car parks, businesses, parks, busy thoroughfares, and other places in order to preach to people wherever they can be found. While every publisher is encouraged to engage in public witnessing where possible, many will have the opportunity to participate in two exciting new initiatives for public witnessing.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Special Metropolitan Public Witnessing: </span><span class="font11">As reported in the 2013 Yearbook on pages 16 and 17, a trial initiative for public witnessing began in New York City in November 2011. Tables and carts with attractive displays and literature in several languages were strategically placed in areas of the city with high pedestrian traffic. Each day thousands of people walked by, including many who live in secured apartment buildings and persons who are often away from home. The response was overwhelming. In just one recent month, 3,797 magazines and 7,986 books were placed. Many passers-by requested a Bible study. Since the emphasis was on starting Bible studies, any addresses left by interested ones were immediately forwarded to the appropriate congregation to follow up on the interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In view of the initiative’s success, it is now being expanded worldwide to other densely populated metropolitan areas. The local branch office will identify which cities would benefit. Usually, these are cities with transportation hubs or a large concentration of office or apartment buildings that results in high pedestrian traffic. The Britain branch is now arranging a pilot scheme for London and Birmingham. The branch office has already written to all congregations that are invited to participate in this pilot project, providing them with additional instructions. Regular and special pioneers </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">are g</span><span class="font11">enerally used, although in some places</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">2. What trial initiative began in November 2011? 3. How is this initiative being expanded? auxiliary pioneers also have a share in the work. Later, this project will be extended to other suitable cities and towns in Britain and Ireland.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> How the Witnessing Is Done: </span><span class="font11">Those involved in special metropolitan public witnessing usually wait for someone to come to the table or mobile display. When someone approaches, he is invited to take any literature that interests him. The pioneers gladly answer from the Scriptures any questions he may have. If he takes literature, the pioneers do not mention the donation arrangement. But if he enquires about how our work is funded, they may explain that donations can be sent to the address listed in the literature. When possible, they ask: “Would you like someone to visit your home?” or “Are you aware that a free Bible study comes with that publication?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Sharing in this initiative has been very rewarding. One couple wrote: “Standing at the table and seeing thousands of people go by each day has impressed upon our hearts the vast work that is being done to reach people all around the world. Seeing these masses of people and thinking about how Jehovah truly cares for each person has strengthened our resolve to continue putting the preaching work at the center of our lives. We imagine Jehovah scanning the hearts of all those who pass by the table, searching for those who are worthy. We have rarely felt so close to our angelic coworkers.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Public Witnessing That Is Organized Locally: </span><span class="font11">In addition to special metropolitan public witnessing, another new initiative is being organized by many bodies of elders </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">in th</span><span class="font11">eir local territory. With this initiative,</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">4. How is special metropolitan public witnessing done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">5. How has sharing in this new initiative been rewarding for one couple?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">6. (a) What additional initiative for public witnessing is being organized in many congregations, and how is it different from special metropolitan public witnessing? (b) How may congregations cooperate when engaging in public witnessing? publishers use a table or a mobile display at a busy location within the congregation’s territory boundary. This is different from special metropolitan public witnessing, which uses participants from many congregations to preach in the same high-traffic areas in cities chosen by the branch office.—See the box “Good Cooperation Needed.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> The elders will consider whether the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">cong</span><span class="font11">regation’s territory has areas of</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">7. Where it is practical, how will the elders organize public witnessing locally?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Good Cooperation Needed</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It has been reported that publishers from neighboring congregations sometimes engage in public witnessing on the same street, in the same car park, and in front of the same businesses or transportation hubs. Publishers from different congregations have left magazines in the same lobby, waiting room, or laundromat and have preached to the same businesses. This has caused businesspeople and neighborhood residents to feel overwhelmed on occasion, even when publishers are not preaching at the same time. Therefore, it is generally best to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">stay within the congregation’s assigned territory</span><span class="font12"> when witnessing publicly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If publishers wish to witness publicly in a neighboring congregation’s territory, they should talk to their service overseer. He can then contact the service overseer of the other congregation to obtain permission before those in his congregation proceed. Where different-language congregations are assigned to preach in the same area, the service overseers should communicate with each other so as to avoid irritating people in the neighborhood unnecessarily. By means of good cooperation, all things can take place “decently and by arrangement.”—1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">high pedestrian traffic and determine if it would be practical to organize public witnessing. Possible locations for a table or mobile display include transportation hubs, public squares, parks, busy streets, shopping centres, college campuses, airports, and locations of annual events, subject to appropriate permission being obtained from site owners. There is an advantage in having a table set up in the same location, on the same days, and at the same times. It has been found that tables set up at shopping centres are more effective than those outside a single large store where individuals are usually focused on their reason for visiting that specific store. Some locations, such as busy pavements, may be more conducive to a smaller mobile literature display. Elders can download from our website special files for making displays of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font11"> book.

Those who participate will carry out the work in much the same way as those engaged in special metropolitan public witnessing and should follow the direction of the service overseer closely. If they obtain an address from an interested person who does not live in their territory, they should promptly fill out a Please Follow Up (S-43) form and give it to the secretary.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Public Witnessing in Your Personal Ministry: </span><span class="font11">Some congregations may not have a location in their territory that has sufficient pedestrian traffic to justify setting up a table or making use of a mobile literature display. However, even in those congregations, publishers are encouraged to consider including public witnessing in their personal ministry. Is there a shopping area or a busy store in your territory? Is there a park or a place where people gather? Are there public events that are periodically held in the territory? If so, you may still be able to enjoy public witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> It is Jehovah’s will that “all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) Therefore, we are trying to reach as many people as possible with the Kingdom message before the end comes. (Matt. 24:14) In many places it is a challenge to find people at home. Yet, we may be able to speak to them when they are away from home in a public setting. Public witnessing may be the only way that some people will get an opportunity to hear the good news. Therefore, may we fully accomplish our ministry by preaching to people wherever they may be found.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">8. If there are no organized efforts in the congregation for public witnessing, what opportunities to preach publicly may still be available?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">9. Why should we be conscientious about preaching to people wherever they may be found?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTION BOX</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Before an unbaptized publisher is approved for baptism, to what extent should he be attending congregation meetings and sharing in the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Getting baptized is the most important decision a person will make. Therefore, before an individual is approved for baptism, he must have a reasonable understanding of what God requires of him. In addition, he should already be demonstrating his determination to live by God’s requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Christians are commanded not to forsake the gathering of themselves together, so an unbaptized publisher should already be showing diligence in attending congregation meetings. (Heb. 10:24, 25) He would generally also be participating by commenting. Likely, he would be enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School, although this is not a requirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In addition, since Christians have been given the commission to preach the good news and make disciples, an unbaptized publisher should be regularly sharing in the ministry before baptism. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) How many months should he be publishing before he can be baptized? Logically, he should be allowed sufficient time to demonstrate that he is steadfastly determined to have a regular and zealous share in the ministry month after month. (Ps. 78:37) However, it need not be very long from the time that he starts publishing until he qualifies for baptism, perhaps just a few months. How much field service time should he be reporting? There are no hard-and-fast rules. The elders should consider each publisher’s unique circumstances and be reasonable and balanced.—Luke 21:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The elders (or ministerial servants in congregations with very few elders) who meet with a baptismal candidate should remember that every person is different, and they should use good judgment in determining whether he qualifies for baptism. They would expect him to have a real desire to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and to demonstrate an appreciation for his privilege of associating with Jehovah’s organization and sharing in the ministry. The elders understand that he has not yet grown to spiritual maturity or gained the skill of experienced baptized evangelizers. If the elders feel that the candidate is not qualified for baptism, they should kindly inform him of the Scriptural reasons for their decision and help him to receive spiritual assistance.</span></p>

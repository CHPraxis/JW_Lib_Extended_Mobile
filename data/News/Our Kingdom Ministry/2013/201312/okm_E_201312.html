<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>How to Prepare Ef fective Introductions</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Just as a flavorful appetizer builds anticipation for the meal that follows, a good introduction opens the door to a positive Scriptural </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">discu</span><span class="font9">ssion. Effective introductions may vary</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. How important is it to have a good introduction?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">in their length and content, but just like tasty food, they always require advance thought and preparation. (Prov. 15:28) What makes an introduction effective?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Choose Topics of Interest: </span><span class="font9">Our introduction must arouse interest, or the householder may end the conversation. So when preparing, think about local interests. Are people in the community interested in good government, happy family life, or an end to war? People generally like to give their opinion, so prepare a thought-provoking viewpoint question. Could you use one of the sample introductions from Our Kingdom Ministry and adapt it to your territory? Why not occasionally practice some introductions during your Family Worship evening?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Consider Culture and Background: </span><span class="font9">In some places, we are expected to state the reason for our visit right away. In other places, it is considered impolite if a visitor does not first inquire about the welfare of the householder and perhaps share some personal information. In some areas, the religious background of people allows us to refer freely to the Bible in our introduction. (Acts 2:14-17) However, where people belong to a non-Christian religion, or to no religion at all, it may be better to mention the Bible on a return visit, rather than at the outset.—Acts 17:22-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Opening Words: </span><span class="font9">Prepare your opening words carefully. Short, simple sentences are usually best. The way we deliver our opening words is also vital. Be enthusiastic. Have a sincere, friendly smile that reflects personal interest in the householder. Following these suggestions will help us to prepare appetizing introductions that will encourage people in our territory to feed at “the table of Jehovah.” —1 Cor. 10:21.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">2. How may we prepare an introduction that is interesting?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. How may we tailor our introduction to the culture and background of those in our territory?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">4. What attention should we give to the opening words of our introduction?</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah wants us to draw close to him. (Jas. 4:8) To help us do that, beginning the </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">week</span><span class="font9"> of January 6, we will study Draw Close</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Beginning the week of January 6, what opportunities will we have to draw closer to Jehovah?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">to Jehovah at the Congregation Bible Study. Regarding the purpose of the book, the opening page states: “Pondering the way Jehovah manifests each of his qualities, seeing how Jesus Christ perfectly reflected them, and understanding how we too may cultivate them will draw us closer to God.” Congregations previously considered this book during 2004 and 2005. However, for many of the approximately two million publishers who have come into the truth since then, this will be the first time that Jehovah’s endearing qualities have been discussed in detail. For those who studied the book before, the review will help them to deepen their appreciation for Jehovah’s attributes.—Ps. 119:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font10"> How It Will Be Studied: </span><span class="font9">The conductor will begin with a brief introduction, perhaps one or two sentences. The material does not stipulate which scriptures should be read, so during the study the conductor will select key scriptures to read. One or two questions may be asked at the end of each lesson as a review. If the material includes the box “Questions for Meditation,” this will be used as the review. As time permits, the conductor can have some of the cited verses in the box read and then ask auxiliary questions to draw out comments from the audience.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font10"> Benefit Fully: </span><span class="font9">Prepare in advance even if you previously studied this book. Have a share in commenting, as this will bring praise to Jehovah, help you to remember the information, and benefit others in attendance. (Ps. 35:18; Heb. 10:24, 25) As you meditate on Jehovah’s matchless qualities, you will draw closer to him. (Ps. 77:11-13) In turn, you will be more determined to obey his commandments and more motivated to tell others about him.—Ps. 150:1-6.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In order for someone to become a worshipper of Jehovah, he must learn what the Bible teaches. However, some belong to a non-Christian religion and do not consider the Bible to be God’s Word. Others do not believe in God at all and lack respect for the Bible. Which tools have proved to be helpful for those who are not initially inclined to accept the Bible Teach book? The suggestions below are based on the comments of publishers from some 20 different countries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Those Who Do Not Believe in God: If someone says that he does not believe in God, it is beneficial to find out why. Is it because he believes in evolution? Has he lost</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Will the Bible Teach book appeal to everyone initially? Explain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. If someone tells us that he does not believe in God, what should we try to find out, and why? faith in God because of the injustice in the world or the hypocrisy in religion? Is he from a land that suppressed belief in God? Perhaps he does not adamantly deny God’s existence, but he has never felt the need to believe in Him. Many publishers find that asking, “Have you always felt that way?” prompts the person to explain. Listen and do not interrupt. When we understand why the person does not believe in God, we will know how to reply and which publication to offer.—Prov. 18:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> When replying, take care to avoid making the person feel that you are attacking his viewpoint. This suggestion came from the United States: “It is very important to respect the personal freedom of individuals to decide what they believe. Rather than seeking to win arguments, it is best to pose questions that make people think and reach their own conclusions.” After hearing the householder express himself, one traveling overseer often prefaces his reply by asking, “Have you ever considered this as a possibility?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The concept of God is foreign to many who are Buddhist. Some publishers in Britain like to use the brochure Lasting Peace and Happiness—How to Find Them when witnessing to such ones. After considering the introduction, they discuss the section “Is There Really a Most High Creator?” and then the section “A Guidebook for the Blessing of All Mankind.” Afterward, they may be able to introduce the Bible Teach book and tell the householder, “Even if you do not believe in God, studying the Bible is beneficial because it contains much practical guidance.” A pioneer in the United States who is serving in the Chinese field said: “Many in our territory enj oy reading. So they often read the entire publication before we return. But they may not understand the concept of a Bible study. So I like to offer the Good News brochure on the initial call because it is written in a way that </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">enco</span><span class="font9">urages discussion.” A circuit overseer</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">3. How can we demonstrate respect for the person and his beliefs?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. How may we help those who are Buddhist? serving in a Chinese-language circuit in the United States reports that it is possible to introduce the Bible Teach book on the initial call. However, it may be better to start the study in chapter 2, which gives an introduction to the Bible, rather than in chapter 1, which discusses God.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> It takes time for someone to build faith in God, so patience is vital. Our initial conversations may not move a person to agree that a Creator exists. But perhaps in time he will acknowledge that it might be possible, or he may say that he understands why someone could come to that conclusion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Those Who Lack Interest or Confidence in the Bible: Often, however, a person who acknowledges that God may exist is not interested in what the Bible teaches because he does not believe that it is God’s Word. Perhaps he lives in a non-Christian land and associates the Bible with Christendom. Or he may live in a so-called Christian land that is very secular, and he may not think that the Bible will be useful to him. How can we help such ones to develop interest in the Bible and eventually accept a study in the Bible Teach book?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> The branch office in Greece wrote: “The best way to help people who lack interest </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">in th</span><span class="font9">e Bible is simply to open the Bible and</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">5. Why is patience important?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13">■ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Australia: </span><span class="font9">John, an educated man, went to church as a child but became a “staunch atheist.” A pioneer left him the brochure </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Was Life Created?</span><span class="font9"> and then on a subsequent visit left the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Origin of Life</span><span class="font9"> brochure.

When he thought John was ready, he offered him the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible —God’s Word or Man’s?</span><span class="font9"> After reading it, John began describing himself as a “mild agnostic.” The pioneer then introduced the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach </span><span class="font9">book, showing John paragraph 8 on page 20 and paragraphs 13-16 on pag es 23-24.

<p><span class="font9">It is exciting to see how Jehovah is blessing the ingathering, with over a quarter of a million people being baptized each year. (Deut. 28:2) Once a publisher helps a student to baptism, the tendency may be for the publisher to discontinue the study and focus on helping others. The student may also be inclined to stop the study in order to devote more time to the ministry. However, it is important for Bible students to have a good foundation in the truth. They need to be “rooted” in Christ and “stabilized in the faith.” (Col. 2:6, 7; 2 Tim. 3:12) Therefore, after a student gets baptized, he should continue his Bible study until he has completed both the Bible Teach and the “God’s Love” books.—See the April 2011 Our Kingdom Ministry, page 2.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>What Motivates Us to Preach?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Preaching the good news of God’ s Kingdom is the most meaningful work that we can do today. Indeed, with this one activity, we demonstrate obedience to the two greatest commandments, namely, to love Jehovah and to love our neighbor. (Mark 12:29-31) Love is a powerful motivating force that can stir us to be zealous ministers.—1 John 5:3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What is the relationship between love and our ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Love for Jehovah: </span><span class="font10">Love for our dearest Friend, Jehovah, moves us to speak up in his behalf. For some 6,000 years, he has been slandered by Satan. (2 Cor. 4: 3, 4) Therefore, people believe that God torments sinners in a burning hell, that he is a mysterious Trinity, and that he is disinterested in humans. Many have even come to the conclusion that he does not exist. How we long for people to know the truth about our heavenly Father! Our diligent efforts to be God’s witnesses bring him great pleasure and frustrate Satan. —Prov. 27:11; Heb. 13:15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Love for Neighbor: </span><span class="font10">Each time we give a witness to someone, we demonstrate love for him. People desperately need to hear the good news during these critical times. Many are like the Ninevites in Jonah’s day who did “not at all know the difference between their right hand and their left.” (Jonah 4:11) Our ministry teaches people how to live happy, successful lives. (Isa. 48:17-19) It gives them hope. (Rom. 15:4) If they listen and act on what they learn, they “will be saved.” —Rom. 10:13, 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Good children do not demonstrate love for their parents only on scheduled occasions. They strive to be loving all the time. Similarly, strong love for God and for neighbor will motivate us to be alert for opportunities to witness all the time, not just during scheduled witnessing periods. We will preach without letup. (Acts 5:42) Such love will never be forgotten by Jehovah.—Heb. 6:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">2. How does our preaching demonstrate love for Jehovah?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. In what way does our ministry show love for neighbor?</span></p></li>

Invite audience to name some of the businesses and local government agencies in the congregation’s territory that may be interested in a particular subject discussed in our magazines. Song 92 and Prayer</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Who Would Be Interested in This?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The Watchtower and Awake! are prepared with the worldwide field in mind. Therefore, the articles deal with a wide variety of topics. As we read each article in our personal copy, we should consider whom in particular it may interest, and then make it a point </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">to off</span><span class="font10">er it to that person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">1. When we read our copy of The Watchtower or Awake! what should we consider, and why?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Does the current Watchtower discuss a Bible topic that you and a workmate previously talked about? Is there an article on family life that would be of help to a relative? Do you have an acquaintance who is planning a trip to a land that has been featured in Awake!? Would one of the magazines appeal to certain businesses or local government agencies in your territory? For example, a magazine that highlights challenges facing the elderly may be of particular interest at nursing homes. Law enforcement agencies may be interested in a magazine on the subject of crime.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font9"> Results: </span><span class="font10">After receiving the October 2011 Awake! on “How to Raise Responsible Children,” a couple in South Africa phoned 25 schools in their congregation’s territory. Twenty-two accepted copies and distributed them to their students. Another couple in that country had the same idea and placed copies at schools in their territory. Teachers at one of the schools decided to use the magazine in their weekly orientation and reading program. The couple shared their experience with a circuit overseer. He then encouraged congregations in his circuit to approach schools in their territories. The branch office received so many requests for additional magazines that this issue had to be reprinted!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Our magazines discuss the real meaning behind current events and direct attention to the Bible and God’s Kingdom. They are the only magazines on earth that are “publishing salvation.” (Isa. 52:7) Therefore, we want to give them wide distribution. A good way to do that is by asking yourself, ‘Who would be interested in this?’</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">2. What topics covered in our magazines may be of particular interest to others?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Relate an experience that illustrates the value of offering specific issues of the magazines to those who we feel may be interested in their contents.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10">When Jehovah conveyed important information to Abraham and Jeremiah, he did so not only by telling them but also by showing them. (Gen. 15:5; Jer. 18:1-6) We can help our students to grasp and appreciate Bible truths by making good use of visual aids, such as our videos.

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Death is an enemy of all people, regardless of their beliefs. (1 Cor. 15:26) Many wonder where the dead are and whether they will </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">see t</span><span class="font9">hem again.

<p><span class="font9">around the earth will participate in a monthlong distribution of Kingdom News No. 38, entitled “Can the Dead Really Live Again?” This special campaign will begin on November 1. After the special distribution, Kingdom News No. 38 will be used in the ministry as a tract.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> How It Is Designed: Kingdom News No. 38 is designed to be folded lengthwise so that the front shows the intriguing title along with the words “Would you say . . . yes? no? maybe?” When the reader opens the Kingdom News, he will see what the Bible says in answer to the title question and what the Bible’s promise can mean for him. He will also see reasons why he can believe the Bible. The back of the Kingdom News poses an interesting question for him to think about and invites him to learn more.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> How It Will Be Distributed: This campaign will be similar to campaigns for distributing Memorial and district convention invitations. The elders will provide direction on how the local territory will be covered, in harmony with the letter they received dated April 1, 2013. Congregations with limited territory can offer to help nearby congregations that have more territory. When obtaining your supply of Kingdom News No. 38, remember to take only the amount that you will need for one week. During the campaign, copies may be distributed in public witnessing after all the house-to-house territories have been worked. If all copies are placed before the end of the month, the literature offer should be featured. On the first Saturday, we will focus on participating in the special campaign rather than on starting Bible studies. On weekends, we should also offer the magazines when appropriate. Are you making arrangements to have a full </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">share</span><span class="font9"> in this special campaign?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Our Web site, jw.org, is designed to appeal to people of all ages. The section of the Web site entitled “Children” (go to Bible Teachings </span><span class="font11">&gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9">Children) helps young children and their parents to draw close to one another and to Jehovah.

(1 Cor. 13:11) How, then, can you select age-appropriate material to study with your children? Ask yourself: ‘What will capture my children’s interest? How much will they understand? How long is their attention span?’ With children who are three years of age or younger, you might discuss the stories found under “My Bible Lessons.” Other families enjoy the Bible stories in the section “Teach Your Children.” Also, consider the following options.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Family Worship Projects: These projects are tools to help family heads study with their children. To learn how to use the stories and activities, click the download button, and read the “Parents’ Guide” for each project. Use picture activities, such as coloring pages, to teach younger children. Help older children to complete the study activities. All the activities in each project relate to the same Bible story or lesson, so children of all ages can participate in the same family worship project.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Become Jehovah’s Friend: The videos, songs, and activities in this section of our Web site help parents to inculcate God’s Word into their little children. (Deut. 31:12) Each short animated video teaches an important lesson. Activities such as search-and-find games underscore those lessons. Since children often like to sing—and songs help children to remember what they have learned—Kingdom songs and songs written especially for children are posted regularly.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Parents, Jehovah wants you to be successful mothers and fathers. So ask him to help you teach your chil dren the truth. (Judg. 13:8) With Jehovah’s support, you can train your children to become “wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.”—2 Tim. 3:15; Prov. 4:1-4.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">Review</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following questions will be considered at the Theocratic Ministry School during the week beginning October 28, 2013.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What does it mean to have “the mind of Christ”? (1 Cor. 2:16) [Sept. 2, w08 7/15 p. 27 par. 7]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. In what ways do we “flee from fornication”? (1 Cor. 6:18) [Sept. 2, w08 7/15 p. 27 par. 9; w04 2/15 p. 12 par. 9]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. What did Paul mean when he wrote that women should “keep silent in the congregations”? (1 Cor. 14:34) [Sept. 9, w12 9/1 p. 9, box]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. How should Paul’s words recorded at 2 Corinthians 1:24 affect elders today? [Sept. 16, w13 1/15 p. 27 pars. 2-3]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">5. How may we be guided by the statement found at 2 Corinthians 9:7? [Sept. 23, g 5/08 p. 21, box]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">6. How may we benefit from heeding Paul’s counsel found at Galatians 6:4? [Sept. 30, w12 12/15 p. 13 par. 18]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">7. What does it mean “to observe the oneness of the spirit”? (Eph. 4:3) [Oct. 7, w12 7/15 p. 28 par. 7]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">8. How did Paul feel about the things he had left behind? (Phil. 3:8) [Oct. 14, w12 3/15 p. 27 par. 12]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">9. What is the import of the counsel: “Let us not sleep on as the rest do”? (1 Thess. 5:6) [Oct. 21, w12 3/15 p. 10 par. 4]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">10. How was Jesus’ sacrificial death “a corresponding ransom”? (1 Tim. 2:6) [Oct. 28, w11 6/15 p. 13 par. 11]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">What Will You Do During the Holidays?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because many people are home from work during religious and national holidays, these are often good times for us to share in the ministry. Congregations are encouraged to make special arrangements for holiday witnessing. If many in the territory will be sleeping later than usual, it would be good to adjust the time for the meeting for field service. An announcement may be made during the Service Meeting informing the congregation of any special arrangements for holiday witnessing and encouraging all who can to participate. Of course, holidays also afford us time to rest or to care for personal matters. But why not set aside part of the day for the ministry? Then you will enjoy the refreshment that comes from engaging in sacred service.—Matt. 11:29, 30.</span></p>

These cities join Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City, where the program has already been established. From September 2012 through March 2013, publishers at these displays placed 90,896 magazines and 66,263 books. Additionally, 5,173 Bible studies were requested.

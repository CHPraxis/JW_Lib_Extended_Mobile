<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? has been designed to help us start Bible studies. But it is also an effective tool that we can use to scatter seeds of truth. (Eccl. 11:6) Here are some suggestions to help us make good use of it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> To Start a Conversation: You might hand the tract to the householder, point to the six questions on the cover, and ask: </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">“Whi</span><span class="font14">ch of these questions have you won-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">1. The Know the Truth tract is useful for doing what? 2. How could we use the tract to start a conversation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">dered about?” After getting his reply, consider from the tract the Bible’s answer to one of the householder’s questions and read one of the cited scriptures. Read or summarize the back page, and offer the Bible Teach book. Even if he does not accept the book, he has received the tract, which may enable the truth to take root in his heart.—Matt. 13:23.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> If the Householder Is Busy: You might say: “Since this is an inconvenient time, let me leave you this tract. It lists six basic questions that most of us have asked and gives a direct answer to each one from the Bible. When I see you again, let me know what you think.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> When Doing Street Work: You could say: “Hello. Have you ever asked any of these questions? [Allow for response.] This shows the clear, satisfying answers that are found in the Bible.” If the person is not in a rush, you may be able to discuss one of the answers from the tract and even offer the Bible Teach book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Not-at-Homes: In some territories, publishers usually leave literature out of sight at not-at-homes. If that is the custom in your congregation, why not occasionally leave the Know the Truth tract? When returning you could say: “When we were here before, you were not at home, so we left this tract in your door. Which of these questions would you like to have answered?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> The Know the Truth tract presents the truth in a simple, straightforward way. It appeals to those of all religions and cultures. It is easy to present; even young and new publishers can place it. Are you using it on every </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">appro</span><span class="font14">priate occasion?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">3. If a householder is busy, what might we do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">4. What could we say when offering the tract in street work?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13">5. How may we occasionally use the tract at not-at-homes?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13">6. What makes the Know the Truth tract an effective preaching tool?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Beginning next month, a new series will appear in the public edition of The Watchtower to help us start Bible studies. It is entitled “Learn From God’s Word.” While some </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">in th</span><span class="font14">e territory will no doubt enjoy reading</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">1. What new series will appear in the public edition of The Watchtower, and how has it been designed?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">each installment, the articles are really designed to be discussed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Features: The title and subheadings are written as questions to ask the householder during the discussion. Key scriptures are cited, not quoted, so that the householder can enjoy learning directly from the pages of God’s Word. Paragraphs are short so that they can be considered right on the doorstep. Each article refers to the Bible Teach book to help you transfer the study to that publication when appropriate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> How to Use It: When offering magazines you could ask an interest-arousing question on the general topic of the article. For example, the January 1 issue discusses the value of the Bible. You might ask: “Do you view the Bible as God’s Word or simply as a good book? [Allow for response.] I have something interesting on this subject.” Point out the first question, read the first paragraph, and look up the cited scripture. Read the question again, and ask for the householder’s comments. Consider as much material as appropriate, using the numbered questions as discussion points. Before leaving, direct attention to the next numbered question and make definite arrangements to return and discuss it. Go back to consider more of the article each week until you can bring the next issue. Another option is to use the direct approach and simply offer a Bible study to the householder. Then use the magazine article to demonstrate the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> You can also use this new series effectively on your magazine route and other return visits. You could simply say: “There is a new feature in The Watchtower. Let me show you how to use it.” It is our prayer that this new series will enable many more to “come to an </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">accur</span><span class="font14">ate knowledge of truth.”—1 Tim. 2:4.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">The theme for the 2011 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses is Family Worship. The calendar features modern-day families and their Biblical equivalents. It also shows married couples and single servants of Jehovah studying his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Bible characters shown on the calendar delighted in the law of Jehovah, and this was vital in helping them to deal with the unique challenges they faced. (Ps. 1:2, 3) As we examine each scene, we will be reminded of the importance of Family Worship, whether we belong to a family that is large or small, spiritually united or divided. Space is provided on the calendar for you to indicate the day your family has set aside for Family Worship. Have you filled it out?</span></p>

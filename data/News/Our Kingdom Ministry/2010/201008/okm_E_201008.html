<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>A Provision for Christian Ministers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In 1938, Jehovah’s organization began a new arrangement. Groups of congregations were invited to attend zone assemblies, </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">now</span><span class="font10"> called circuit assemblies. For what pur-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1. What new arrangement began in 1938, and for what purpose?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">pose? The January 1939 issue of the Informant (now Our Kingdom Ministry) answered: “These assemblies are a part of Jehovah’s Theocratic Organization for the conduct of his Kingdom service. The instruction provided there is essential for each one in order to properly do the work assigned.” When we consider the increase in Kingdom proclaim-ers from only 58,000 in 1938 to over 7,000,000 in 2009, it is obvious that circuit assemblies are accomplishing their purpose to help ministers “do the work assigned”!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Theme for Coming Year: We look forward to the program beginning in September and the encouragement it will provide. The theme “You Are No Part of the World” is taken from John 15:19. What are some of the talks that will surely benefit Christian ministers? On Saturday we will hear the talk “FullTime Service Protects Us—How?” We will also enjoy a three-part symposium “Do Not Be Contaminated by . . .” “The Wild Beast,” “The Great Harlot,” and “The Traveling Merchants.” On Sunday we will hear a symposium with the theme “Love Jehovah, Not the World.” Other talks include “Continue as ‘Aliens and Temporary Residents’ ” and “Take Courage! You Can Conquer the World.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> After attending a recent circuit assembly, one sister who had slowed down in the ministry wrote that the program caused her to reevaluate her circumstances and to be determined to “get out in service and stop making excuses!” No doubt the circuit assembly program for the new service year will help all of us love Jehovah rather than the world. (1 John 2:15-17) Make sure you are present and attentive so as to benefit fully from this </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">lovin</span><span class="font10">g provision for Christian ministers!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">Song 116</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Food at the Proper Time”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> After attending our special assembly day, we often say, “That was just what we needed!” One circuit overseer reported that after hearing the current program, some in his circuit expressed the desire to increase their </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">share</span><span class="font10"> in the ministry. One traveling overseer</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. How did the current special assembly day program help you and others? said, “It helped us to think clearly about where we are in the stream of time as we review our choices in life.” Another said, “A number of publishers expressed the thought that this was a wake-up call for them to make sure that they are focusing on what is most important, the ministry.” How did the special assembly day help you?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The program for the coming service year will also be just what we need. The theme is “Take Refuge in Jehovah,” taken from Psalm 118:8, 9. Here are some of the subjects to be discussed: “How Jehovah Is a Fortress in Times of Distress,” “Help Others Find Refuge Under Jehovah’s Wings,” “Imitate Jehovah in Providing Refuge,” “Young People, Make Jehovah Your Confidence!” and “Our Spiritual Paradise—Jehovah’s Provision for Refuge.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In Order to Benefit: Once the date is announced, make definite plans to attend, and invite your Bible students to join you. In order for us to “bear fruit with endurance,” we must retain what we hear. (Luke 8:15) So listen carefully to the program, and take brief notes on the main points as well as instruction that you plan to apply in your life and ministry. Take time after the assembly to discuss the program as a family, and consider specific ways that you and your family can apply the information.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Like a tasty and nourishing meal, this year’s special assembly day has been prepared with much love and forethought. May Jehovah bless your efforts to attend and to benefit from this “food at the proper time” to spiritually nourish Christian ministers. —Matt. 24:45.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> How many in your congregation first came into contact with the truth through informal witnessing? You might be surprised by the answer. Informal witnessing involves sharing the good news with people whom we meet in our daily activities—when traveling, visiting relatives or neighbors, or shopping, as well as at school, at work, and so forth. In </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">one</span><span class="font11"> group of over 200 baptized Wit-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. (a) What is informal witnessing? (b) How many present at this meeting first came into contact with the truth through informal witnessing?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">nesses, 40 percent were first contacted through informal witnessing! Therefore, this method of preaching is very effective.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Evangelizers in the first century often witnessed informally. For example, while traveling through Samaria, Jesus witnessed to a woman who was drawing water at Jacob’s fountain. (John 4:626) Philip started a conversation with an Ethiopian court official who was reading from the book of Isaiah by asking: “Do you actually know what you are reading?” (Acts 8:26-38) When imprisoned in Philippi, the apostle Paul witnessed to a jailer. (Acts 16:23-34) Later, while under house arrest, Paul “would kindly receive all those who came in to him, preaching the kingdom of God to them and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ.” (Acts 28:30, 31) You too can witness informally, even if you are shy. How?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font10"> Getting Started: </span><span class="font11">Many of us find it difficult to start conversations with strangers. Even with regard to acquaintances, bringing up the truth may seem a bit awkward. We will be motivated to speak up, however, if we meditate on Jehovah’s goodness, the spiritual treasures he has given his servants, and the dire condition of people in the world. (Jonah 4:11; Ps. 40:5; Matt. 13:52) In addition, we can ask Jehovah to help us ‘muster up boldness.’ (1 Thess. 2:2) One Gilead student said: “I have often found that prayer helps when it is difficult for me to talk to people.” If you are hesitant to speak, say a brief, silent prayer.—Neh. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;"><sup>4</sup> A</span><span class="font11">s the name suggests, informal</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">2. What examples of informal witnessing do we find in the Scriptures?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. What can help us to overcome shyness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. What goal might we initially set for ourselves, and why?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">witnessing does not require that we begin the conversation with a formal introduction or a scripture. We may find it helpful to have the goal of simply starting a conversation without feeling that we must give a witness right away. Many publishers report that accomplishing this step gives them the confidence they need to introduce the good news eventually. If the person does not wish to converse, there is no need to force the issue. Politely conclude the conversation and move on.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">You may find it helpful to have the goal of simply meeting people and starting conversations</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> While shopping at the market, one shy sister first makes eye contact and offers a friendly smile. If the person smiles back, she makes a brief comment. If the person responds favorably, this gives her the confidence to converse further. She listens carefully and tries to discern which aspect of the good news would appeal to the person. Using this approach, she has placed much literature and even started a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font10">Initiating Conversations: </span><span class="font11">What can we say to initiate a conversation? When Jesus conversed with the woman at the well, he started by simply requesting that she give him a drink. (John 4:7) So perhaps we can start a conversation with a friendly greeting or question. As you talk you may find an opportunity to introduce a Scriptural thought and perhaps plant a seed of truth. (Eccl. 11:6) Some have found success by making an intriguing statement that arouses curiosity and prompts an inquiry. For example,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">5. What helps one shy sister to witness informally?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">6. How might we start a conversation in an informal setting?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">while waiting to see the doctor, you may spark a conversation by saying, “I’ll be glad when I won’t get sick anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Being observant will also help us to strike up conversations. If we observe a parent with well-behaved children, we might commend the parent and ask, “What has helped you to be a successful parent?” One sister takes note of the subjects discussed by others at work and then shares specific information based on what her coworkers are interested in. When she learned that a woman at her job was planning to get married, she gave her an Awake! that discussed how to plan a wedding. This led to further Bible discussions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Another way to start conversations is by reading our literature where oth</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">ers can see us. One brother opens The Watchtower or Awake! to an article with an intriguing title and quietly begins to read it. If he notices someone nearby looking at his magazine, he asks a question or makes a brief comment on the article. This often leads to a conversation and a witness. Simply leaving one of our publications where it is visible may arouse the curiosity of workmates or classmates and prompt them to inquire about it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font10"> Creating Opportunities: </span><span class="font11">In view of the urgency of the preaching work, we should not view informal witnessing as something that can be left mere-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">9, 10. (a) How can we create opportunities to witness informally? (b) How have you been able to do this?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">ly to chance. Rather, we should seek to create opportunities to give a witness as we go about our daily activities. Think ahead about the people you are likely to meet, and consider how you might start a friendly conversation. Keep a Bible handy as well as literature that you can share with those who show interest. —1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">By being resourceful, many publishers have found ways to create opportunities to witness informally</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> By being resourceful, many publishers have found ways to create opportunities to witness informally. A sister who lives in a high-security apartment building uses the facility’s recreation area to put together jigsaw puzzles of beautiful nature scenes. When people stop and comment on the beauty of the scene, she uses that opportunity to start a conversation and tell them about the Bible’s promise of “a new heaven and a new earth.” (Rev. 21: 1-4) Can you think of ways that you could create opportunities to witness informally?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>11</sup></span><span class="font10"> Following Up Interest: </span><span class="font11">If you find a listening ear, try to follow up the interest. If appropriate, you might say to the person: “I have thoroughly enjoyed talking with you. Where can I reach you so that we can talk again?” Some publishers just hand their address and phone number to the person and say: “I enjoyed our conversation. If you would like to know more about what we discussed, here is how you can contact me.” If you cannot personally follow up the interest, arrange for the appropriate congregation to do so by promptly submitting a Please Follow Up (S-43) form to your congregation secretary.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">11. How may we follow up the interest we find when witnessing informally?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>12</sup> The time we spend doing informal witnessing should be reported. Therefore, be sure to keep a record of it, even if it is only a few minutes a day. Consider this: If every publisher witnessed informally for five minutes each day, that would add up to more than 17 million hours each month!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>13</sup> We have the noblest reasons to witness informally—love for God and neighbor. (Matt. 22:37-39) Hearts filled with appreciation for Jehovah’s qualities and purposes impel us to speak about “the glory of the splendor of his kingship.” (Ps. 145:7, 10-12) Genuine concern for our neighbors moves us to take advantage of every appropriate opportunity to share the good news while there is still time. (Rom. 10:13,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">14 ) With a little forethought and preparation, all of us can witness informally and perhaps experience the joy of introducing the truth to someone of honest heart.</span></p></li>

At a convention a year later, a brother he did not recognize greeted him warmly. It was one of the men to whom he had given a handbill at the garage the year before! The man had gone to hear the public talk and had turned in his name for a Bible study. Both he and his wife had been baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> A sister who learned the truth through informal witnessing considers her special territory to be the people she meets through her three children. Her territory includes neighbors and parents she meets at school and at meetings for parents. Whenever she introduces herself, she makes a simple but heartfelt statement that the Bible is a valuable aid to her in rearing her children, and then she moves on to some other topic. But having broken the ice, she finds it much easier to bring the Bible into subsequent discussions. By using this method, she has helped 12 persons to baptism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> When a sister was visited by an insurance salesman, she took the opportunity to give a witness. She asked him if he would like to be guaranteed good health, happiness, and everlasting life. He said yes and asked her which insurance policy she was talking about. She showed him the Bible’s promises and offered one of our publications, which he read in one evening. A Bible study was arranged. He began attending meetings and was later baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> While traveling by plane, a sister began talking with the woman seated beside her and was able to give a witness. At the conclusion of the flight, the sister gave the woman her address and phone number and encouraged the woman to ask for a Bible study the next time that Jehovah’s Witnesses visited. The very next day, two Witnesses called at the woman’s door. The woman started studying the Bible, made rapid progress, got baptized, and was soon conducting three Bible studies of her own.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> A 100-year-old blind brother who lives in a nursing home often says, “We need the Kingdom.” This has led to questions from nurses and patients that enable him to explain what the Kingdom is. One of the women who works there asked him what he will do in the Paradise. He replied, “I will see and walk again and burn my wheelchair.” Since he is blind, he asks her to read the magazines to him. When the brother’s daughter visited, the worker asked the daughter for permission to take the magazines home. A nurse told the daughter, “Our new theme in the nursing home is: ‘We need the Kingdom.’ ”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11"> A sister waiting in line at a restaurant overheard a group of elderly men sitting nearby who were discussing political issues. One man stated that the government cannot solve our problems. The sister told herself, ‘This is my chance.’ She said a brief prayer and approached them. After introducing herself, she told them about a government that will solve mankind’s problems, God’s Kingdom, and offered them a brochure that she had with her. Just then the manager approached. The sister thought he was going to ask her to leave. Instead, he told her that he had been listening and would like a brochure too. An employee who was also listening approached with tears rolling down her face. She was a former Bible student who wanted to resume her study.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Have You Used the Back Cover?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">When people pick up a magazine, they usually look at the cover then impulsively turn it over and glance at the back. The back cover of the public edition of The Watchtower has several interest-arousing questions and statements along with the page numbers indicating where the information can be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We can use this feature to get good ideas for introductory questions to start a conversation. If we work the territory frequently, we can vary our presentation by using different questions throughout the month. If a householder is busy, we could shorten our presentation by showing one of the questions on the back cover and saying, “If you would like to learn the answer, I can leave these magazines with you, and we can talk more when you have time.” Some publishers may want to start conversations by showing the back cover to the householder and inviting him to choose a question that interests him. Then they may point out where the answer is found and read a scripture chosen in advance. Perhaps you can think of other ways to use the back cover to stimulate interest in The Watchtower.</span></p>

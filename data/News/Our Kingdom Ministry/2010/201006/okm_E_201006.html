<p><span class="font12">Song 7</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Is Your Eye Simple?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> What our eyes focus on influences our actions. How appropriate are Jesus’ words: “If, then, your eye is simple, your whole body will be bright”! (Matt. 6:22) When our eye is spiritually “simple,” it is focused on a single purpose—the doing of God’s will. We put the Kingdom first and are not </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">distra</span><span class="font13">cted by unnecessary material things</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. What does it mean to have a ‘simple eye’? </span><span class="font13">or activities that interfere with the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Need for Self-Examination: Our perception can be distorted by what the advertising media tells us we need or by what others have. Before pursuing an endeavor or a purchase that will require an investment of considerable time, money, or energy, it would be good to “calculate the expense” by asking ourselves, ‘Will this improve my service to Jehovah or hinder it?’ (Luke 14:28; Phil. 1:9-11) It is also wise to consider periodically how we could further simplify our life so as to do more in the ministry.—2 Cor. 13:5; Eph. 5:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> When one sister began regular pioneering, she chose to keep her full-time job although part-time employment would have provided sufficient funds to care for her needs. She eventually concluded: “No one can slave for two masters. I had to sacrifice my wants to take care of my needs. I realized that material things just get old and I would wear myself out trying to get them.” Her circumstances permitted her to make adjustments to simplify her life and to change employment, allowing her to continue in the pioneer ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The urgency of our times makes it even more important that we maintain a simple eye. Every day that passes brings us one day closer to the end of this system of things and the start of God’s new world. (1 Cor. 7: 29, 31) By focusing on the preaching work, we can save both ourselves and those who listen to us.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">2. What could distort our view, but what will help us?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. What do we learn from one sister who made adjustments to simplify her life?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">4. Why is it urgent that we maintain a simple eye now?</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Be Bible-Study Conscious</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jesus gave us a commission to “make disciples . . . , teaching them.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) Therefore, we want to be Bible-study conscious at all times, not just on the one weekend day that is specially set aside to offer Bible studies. The following suggestions may be helpful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Offer It: </span><span class="font12">The more we offer a Bible study, the more opportunities we will have to obtain one. (Eccl. 11:6) Have you tried the direct approach? One congregation in the United States made a concerted effort to do this for</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. What is involved in fulfilling Jesus’ commission at Matthew 28:19, 20?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. To whom may we offer a Bible study? an entire month. How thrilled they were to start 42 new Bible studies! Do not assume that interested ones you call on know that you give Bible lessons. When you return the next time, why not offer a study? If they turn you down, no harm is done. You can continue to cultivate the interest. Have you asked your neighbors, relatives, workmates, and schoolmates if they would like to study the Bible with you? You can also ask your Bible students if they have friends or relatives who would enjoy a study of the Bible.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Helpful Tool: </span><span class="font12">A valuable tool for starting Bible studies is the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? You may give it to householders whether they accept other literature or not. It may be used when working business territory, when doing street work, when sending letters, and when making return visits. It may also be left at not-at-homes. Why not carry it with you when using public transportation, when shopping, and while at work? The back page briefly explains our Bible study arrangement and introduces the Bible Teach book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> After handing the tract to the person, you might point out the questions on the front page and ask him, “Which of these questions are you most interested in?” Then consider together the answer from the tract, and read or paraphrase the back page, which explains our Bible study arrangement. You could then show him where more information on the subject is found in the Bible Teach book, offer the book, and make arrangements to return and continue the discussion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Our territory still contains those yearning to learn what the Bible really teaches. By being Bible-study conscious, we will have increased opportunities to experience the joy of helping others onto the road to life.—Matt. 7: 13, 14.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">(1) Takeyourchild in the ministry as soon as possible; train him to participate according to his age and ability. (Prov. 22:6) (2) Set a good example in making the ministry a priority. (Phil. 1:9,10) (3) Instill love and appreciation for the preaching work during Family Worship and on otheroccasions. (Deut. 6: 6, 7) (4) Be positive about the ministry in your attitude and speech. (Phil. 3:8; 4:8;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1 Tim. 1:12) (5) Share regularly as a family, making the ministry a habit. (Acts 5:41, 42) (6) Associate with those who are zealous ministers. (Prov.13:20) Invite the audience to comment on specific things their parents did to help them to develop an enjoyable and effective ministry.</span></p>

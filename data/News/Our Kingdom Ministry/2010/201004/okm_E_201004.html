<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Be Persuasive in Your Teaching</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Effective ministers, like the apostle Paul, appreciate that “handling the word of the truth aright” involves more than simply quoting from the Holy Scriptures. (2 Tim. 2:15) When using God’s Word, how may we use “persuasion” in our teach-</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing?—</span><span class="font10">Acts 28:23.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What does effective use of God’s Word in the ministry often involve?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Let God’s Word Speak: </span><span class="font10">First, direct attention to the Bible in a way that engenders respect for the godly wisdom it contains. Our confidence in God’s Word may motivate our listener to pay careful attention to the reading of a scripture. (Heb. 4:12) We could simply say: “I have found it beneficial to get God’s thoughts on this matter. Notice what his Word states.” Whenever possible, let God’s Word speak by reading from it directly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Second, explain the scripture used. Many people find it difficult to understand a verse the first time that it is read. An explanation is usually needed to establish its relevance. (Luke 24:26, 27) Isolate the key expressions. A question may help confirm that the point is clearly understood. —Prov. 20:5; Acts 8:30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Reason on Scriptures: </span><span class="font10">Third, endeavor to reach the mind and heart. Help the householder to see how the verse applies to him personally. Reasoning on the Scriptures can persuade a person to change his thinking. (Acts 17:2-4; 19:8) For example, after reading Psalm 83:18 we could reason on how learning someone’s name is fundamental in developing a personal relationship. Then, perhaps ask, “Do you feel that knowing God’s name will make your prayers more meaningful?” Connecting the scripture to the householder’s personal life in this manner demonstrates its practical value. Such persuasive teaching from God’s Word draws honesthearted ones to worship the true and living God, Jehovah.—Jer. 10:10.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>What Do Others Learn From Watching You?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jesus said: “Get under my yoke with me and learn from me.” (Matt. 11:29, ftn.) Clearly, he taught others by setting a good example, not just by his words. Think of what the disciples learned from watching Jesus. He was gentle, kind, and loving.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What did Jesus’ disciples learn from watching him?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">(Matt. 8:1-3; Mark 6:30-34) He was genuinely humble. (John 13:2-5) As they accompanied Jesus in the ministry, the disciples saw that he was a tireless worker who was effective in teaching the truth to others. (Luke 8:1; 21:37, 38) How are others affected by observing us in the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Householders: </span><span class="font12">Our modest dress, good manners, and sincere personal interest in people can have a powerful effect on householders. (2 Cor. 6:3; Phil. 1:27) They notice that we make frequent use of the Bible. Others are impressed that we listen respectfully when they speak. Never underestimate how setting a good example in these areas can draw people to the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Brothers: </span><span class="font12">Think, too, of the positive effect we can have on our brothers. Our zeal for the ministry is contagious. As iron sharpens iron, our well-prepared presentation impels others to hone their evangelizing skills. (Prov. 27:17) Our diligence in keeping an accurate record of those who show interest and then returning promptly helps motivate others to do the same. We</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">you affect others by means of your example? Our good example will please Jehovah and enable us to echo the sentiments of the apostle Paul when he declared: “Become imitators of me, even as I am of Christ.”—1 Cor. 11:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTION BOX</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Should Jehovah’s Witnesses circulate recordings or transcripts of talks?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We are strengthened and encouraged by Bible discourses. (Acts 15:32) Therefore, it is natural to want to share such encouraging information with those who were not present. With the advent of various recording devices, a talk can be recorded and distributed to others at a moment’s notice. Some have maintained a collection of recorded talks, including talks that were given many years ago, and with good motive they lend these talks or reproduce them for friends. Others have created Web sites and posted talks there for anyone to download.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Understandably, there is no objection if we record talks for personal use or for members of our family. In addition, elders may arrange for talks to be recorded for infirm members of the congregation who are unable to attend the meetings. However, there are good reasons for us not to circulate transcripts or recordings of talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Because talks are often delivered with local needs in mind, we could easily misconstrue points from a circulated recording, since we would not be aware of the setting in which the talk was given. In addition, it would be difficult for us to verify who gave the talk and when, so that we can have confidence that the information presented is up-to-date and accurate. (Luke 1:1-4) Further, circulating transcripts or recordings of talks might tempt some to give or accept undue attention and honor. —1 Cor. 3:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The faithful and discreet slave works hard to provide spiritual food in the right “measure” and at “the proper time.” (Luke 12: 42) This includes the arrangement for talks to be given at local congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses and audio recordings that can be downloaded from the official jw.org Web site. We can be confident that the faithful and discreet slave and its Governing Body will provide what we need in order to be made firm in the faith.—Acts 16:4, 5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">1. What did Naomi mean by the expression “it is Jehovah that has humiliated me and the Almighty that has caused me calamity”? (Ruth 1:21) [w05 3/1 p. 27 par. 1]</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Joseph, Mary, their children, and others regularly went up to Jerusalem to attend the annual festivals. On these occasions, they and other worshippers would leave behind their daily cares and focus on the more important spiritual aspects of their life. The festivals afforded time to reflect on and talk about Jehovah’s goodness and to consider his Law. Our upcoming district conventions will give us similar opportunities for joyful worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Preparation Needed: Traveling from Nazareth required that Jesus’ family walk about 120 miles round-trip. Though we do not know how many siblings Jesus had, we can imagine the planning and effort required of Joseph and Mary. Have you made the necessary preparations to attend all three days of the upcoming district convention? This may require taking vacation from work or speaking to your employer or your child’s teacher about having time off. Have you made a hotel reservation if this is needed? Could you take the initiative to help someone in the congregation with special needs to attend the convention?—1 John 3:17, 18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Upbuilding Fellowship: What an opportunity the Jewish festivals provided for upbuilding association with fellow worshippers! Jesus’ family no doubt looked forward to being reunited with longtime friends. They also enjoyed opportunities to make new friends among the throngs of Jews and proselytes who would be present or traveling to and from Jerusalem.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> One reason the faithful and discreet slave</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">3. How did Israel’s festivals provide opportunities for upbuilding association?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. How may we demonstrate that we do not take for granted our united Christian brotherhood?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">arranges for us to come together to hear talks at district conventions instead of presenting the same information in printed form is so that we can encourage one another. (Heb. 10: 24, 25) Therefore, make plans to arrive at the convention early each day to enjoy fellowship with others before the session chairman introduces a musical interlude, signaling that it is time to be seated. Instead of leaving the facility at noon to obtain food, we are encouraged to bring a light lunch and remain at the convention so that we can meet and talk with those around us. Our united Christian brotherhood is a gift from Jehovah that we should never take for grant-ed.—Mic. 2:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> A Time to Learn: From a young age, Jesus took advantage of the festivals to learn about his heavenly Father. (Luke 2:41-49) What will help us and our families to benefit fully from the parts that will be presented? During the sessions, remain seated and avoid talking needlessly. Do not allow your cell phone, pager, or other similar devices to disturb you or others. Focus your eyes on the speaker, and take brief notes. Sit together as a family to make sure that your children are also listening. In the evening take some time to discuss together the points that you enjoyed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Dress and Grooming: Foreign merchants traveling on the road could easily recognize Jesus’ family and other Jewish worshippers who were traveling to and from the festivals because of the fringed edges on their garments and the blue string above the fringe. (Num. 15:37-41) Though Christians do not wear distinctive garb, we are known for dressing modestly and being neat and clean. We should give particular attention to our appearance when traveling to and from the convention and while in the convention city. Even if we change clothes after the program, we should maintain a digni</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">fied </span><span class="font9">appearance and wear our convention</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">5. What will help us to benefit fully from the program?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">6. What should we keep in mind regarding our dress and grooming? badge. In this way we will stand out from non-Witnesses and make a good impression on observers.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Volunteers Needed: Many workers are needed in order for the convention to run smoothly. Could you volunteer to assist? (Ps. 110:3) The work done at conventions is part of our sacred service and gives a fine witness. The manager of one convention facility was so impressed by the volunteers who cleaned the building that he wrote this: “I want to thank you for the most amazing event that I have ever experienced. I have always heard that Jehovah’s Witnesses were special people with a long-standing reputation in our industry of always leaving a facility cleaner than they found it. You and your organization made this facility a better place for the community and did it with the most gracious group of people with which we have ever had the pleasure of being acquainted.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Opportunities to Witness: Many in the convention city will notice well-dressed, clean-cut visitors wearing convention badges, and this may arouse their curiosity, providing opportunities for us to tell them about the convention. One four-year-old brought his copy of a newly released publication to a restaurant after the program and showed it to the waitress. This opened the way for the boy’s parents to invite the woman to the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> The ancient festivals were joyful occasions that spiritually-minded Jews looked forward to. (Deut. 16:15) Jesus’ family was happy to make any sacrifices to attend and benefit fully. We have similar appreciation for our district conventions, viewing them as a gift from our loving heavenly Father. (Jas. 1:17) Now is the time to prepare for this annual opportunity for joyful worship of Jehovah!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Seat Saving: </span><span class="font9">Seats may be saved only for those traveling with you in the same vehicle or living with you in the same home, as well as those with whom you are currently conducting a Bible study.—1 Cor. 13:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Noon Meal: </span><span class="font9">Please bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers and glass containers are not permitted in the convention facility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Donations: </span><span class="font9">We can show our appreciation for the convention arrangements by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at our Kingdom Hall or at the convention. Any checks contributed at the convention should be made payable to “Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Accidents and Emergencies: </span><span class="font9">If a medical emergency arises at the convention site, please contact a nearby attendant, who will immediately notify First Aid so that our qualified first-aid personnel on-site can assess the seriousness of the situation and render assistance. If it is necessary, our first-aid personnel will call 911. This will prevent emergency-response services from receiving many cell-phone calls over minor matters.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">■</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Footwear: </span><span class="font9">Each year a number of injuries occur that are related to footwear. It is best to choose modest, well-fitting shoes that will allow one to walk safely on stairs, gratings, and so forth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">■</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Hearing Impaired: </span><span class="font9">The program will be broadcast in the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. To receive it, you will need to bring a small battery-operated FM receiver with earphones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">■</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Recording: </span><span class="font9">Recording devices should not be connected to the facility’s electric or sound system and may be used only in a way that does not disturb others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">■</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Baby Strollers and Lawn Chairs: </span><span class="font9">Baby strollers and lawn chairs should not be brought to the convention site. However, child-safety seats that can be secured in a seat next to the parents are acceptable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">■</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Fragrances: </span><span class="font9">Most conventions take place in enclosed areas with mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be loving on our part to limit the use of strong fragrances, colognes, and perfumes that may cause reactions in persons with respiratory or related problems.^ Cor. 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">■</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Follow-Up Forms: </span><span class="font9">A </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Please Follow Up </span><span class="font9">(S-43) form should be used to provide information regarding any interest from informal witnessing during the convention. Publishers should bring one or two follow-up forms to the convention. Completed forms may be submitted to the Book Room or given to your congregation secretary on your return.—See the November 2009 Our </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> p. 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">■</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Restaurants: </span><span class="font9">Honor Jehovah’s name by your fine conduct at restaurants. It is customary to leave a 15 to 20 percent tip.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">■</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Hotels: </span><span class="font9">(1) Please do not reserve more rooms than you will actually use, and do not have more people stay in your room than what is allowed. (2) If you must cancel your reservation, notify the hotel immediately. (3) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it, and return it immediately so that others may use it. (4) Do not cook in rooms where cooking is not permitted. (5) Leave a tip for the housekeeper each day. (6) Do not abuse any complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice provisions that are made available for guests to use while they are at the hotel. (7) Display the fruitage of the spirit in dealing with the hotel staff at all times. They are caring for a large number of guests and appreciate our kindness, patience, and reasonableness. (8) The room rate shown on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Recommended Lodging List</span><span class="font9"> is the full price per day, excluding tax. If you are overcharged or billed for things you did not request or use, refuse these charges and inform the Rooming Department at the convention as soon as possible. (9) If a problem arises with your hotel room, inform the Rooming Department while at the convention so they can assist you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">■</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Volunteer Service: </span><span class="font9">The happiness we gain from attending the convention will be even greater if we volunteer to assist with the necessary work involved. (Acts 20:35) Any who wish to do so should report to the Volunteer Service Department at the convention. Children under 16 years of age can also make a fine contribution by working under the direction of a parent or guardian or other adult approved by one of them.</span></p></li></ul>

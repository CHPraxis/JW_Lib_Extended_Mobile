<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> If you ever find yourself asking such a question, take heart! It is neither formal education nor outstanding natural ability that qualifies us as ministers.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> How Jesus Taught: </span><span class="font14">His teaching was simple, down-to-earth, and easy to understand. His questions, illustrations, and uncomplicated introductions captured the listeners’ attention. (Matt. 6:26) He showed sincere interest in people. (Matt. 14:14) Furthermore, Jesus spoke with confidence and authority, knowing that Jehovah had commissioned him and empowered him to carry out his assignment. —Luke 4:18.</span></p></li>

(Isa. 54:13) Because Jehovah preserved a record of the way Jesus taught, we are able to analyze and imitate his methods. Jehovah gives us his holy spirit and trains us through congregation meetings. (John 14:26) In addition, he provides experienced publishers who can help us to become more effective.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> We have every reason to feel qualified to preach, since “our being adequately qualified issues from God.” (2 Cor. 3:5) As we rely on Jehovah and faithfully make good use of his loving provisions, we will “be fully competent, completely equipped </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">for e</span><span class="font14">very good work.”—2 Tim. 3:17.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font15">■ </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Howcan everyone help to maintain an atmosphere conducive to learning at congregation meetings? (Deut. 31:12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Out of deep respect for Jehovah and his provision of congregation meetings, all are encouraged to arrive early and to be ready to be taught by him. It is helpful to occupy seats toward the front of the hall, leaving seats at the back for those with small children and for those who occasionally arrive late. Before the meeting begins, electronic devices should be adjusted to a setting that will not disturb the audience. Disturbances will be few in number and minor in nature when all present maintain a reverential attitude throughout the meeting.—Eccl. 5:1; Phil. 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When new ones start attending meetings, someone in the congregation who is acquainted with them may offer to sit with them. This would be especially helpful if there are small children to be trained. Attending meetings may be a new experience for the family. If so, they will most likely appreciate being able to sit toward the back where it would be less distracting for others should the parents find it necessary to leave the main hall temporarily to care for the needs of the little ones. (Prov. 22:6, 15) Families with small children should not be seated in a separate room where the children may feel free to make noise. It is generally best for the parent to administer discipline or care for other personal needs outside of the main auditorium and then return with the children to the main auditorium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Attendants serve to maintain an atmosphere appropriate for a house of worship. They help families and those who occasionally arrive late to find appropriate seating. The attendants are mindful of being tactful and discreet in helping others to be comfortably seated without unnecessary distraction. They use good judgment when handling any unexpected disturbances. When a child’s conduct becomes distracting to others, attendants may kindly offer assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">All present at meetings for worship can contribute to an atmosphere conducive to learning about Jehovah and his purpose for a peaceful and righteous new world.—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> We eagerly anticipate the spiritual banquet in store for us at the 2010 district convention. All are urged to be present for all three days. There we will encourage one another to walk in integrity with Jehovah as our shield. (Ps. 26:1, 11; Prov. 2:7) Inform teachers and employers well ahead of time that the convention is a necessary part of your worship. By making your plans now and helping others as needed, you can be sure of Jehovah’s blessing on your efforts.—Ps. 37:5; Prov. 10:22.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font18">■ </span><span class="font5">Do not make hotel reservations before your Service Meeting the week of January 4, 2010.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">■ </span><span class="font5">Stay </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font5"> in the hotels on the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Recommended Lodging List.</span><span class="font5"> If rooms are already booked, call another hotel on the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">■ </span><span class="font5">Accept only the rate shown on the list. Obtain a confirmation number, and make your deposit within 10 days by credit card, check, or money order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">■ </span><span class="font5">Each room should be reserved in the name of the person who will actually occupy it. Do not reserve extra rooms. Keep your first reservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">■ </span><span class="font5">If you must cancel a reservation, do so as early as possible. Be sure to receive a cancellation number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">■ </span><span class="font5">Fire regulations require that you not exceed the number of adults that the list allows for each hotel room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">■ </span><span class="font5">Do not call hotels that are not on the list to ask if they have a rate for our conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">■ </span><span class="font5">If there are no rooms available after calling ALL the hotels listed, or if you have a problem with a hotel, inform your congregation secretary.

<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>A Help for Telephone Witnessing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">While we properly give priority to the house-to-house method of preaching, telephone witnessing is an effective way to spread the good news in a congregation’s assigned territory, especially where there are many homes to which we cannot gain access.—Luke 10:5-7; Acts 5: 42; 20:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This feature of the ministry can be encouraging to brothers and sisters who are limited in mobility and spend much of their time at home. Publishers will enjoy an interchange of encouragement when they arrange to share in this form of witnessing with these faithful ones. (Rom. 1: 11, 12) Also, during inclement weather, publishers may choose to participate in telephone witnessing. Generally speaking, groups should be kept small so that all make the best use of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A helpful work sheet is provided on pages 5-6 for use when witnessing by telephone. Space is provided to add presentations that are effective in your territory or that you feel more comfortable using. Feel free to photocopy the work sheet and write on the copy rather than on the original. You may find it helpful to sit at a table and have the work sheet in front of you.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">Putting what off? Filling out the DPA (durable power of attorney) card that is provided for baptized Witnesses. Since “you do not know what your life will be tomorrow,” it is crucial that you decide in advance and indicate in writing what treatments and procedures you would accept in a medical emergency. (Jas. 4:14; Acts 15:28, 29) To help you, the video Transfusion-Alternative Health Care—Meeting Patient Needs and Rights has been produced. View it, and then prayerfully review what you learned with the help of the questions set out below.—Note: Because the video includes brief surgical scenes, parents should use discretion in viewing the video with young children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">(1) Why are some in the medical community reevaluating the use of blood transfusions? (2) Give three examples of complex surgeries that have been performed without blood transfusions. (3) How many physicians and surgeons worldwide have indicated their willingness to treat patients without blood transfusions? Why are they willing to do so? (4) What have recent hospital studies revealed about blood use? (5) What are the medical risks associated with blood transfusions? (6) What conclusion have many experts reached regarding the benefits of transfusion alternatives? (7) What causes anemia? How tolerable is it in humans? What can be done to compensate for it? (8) How can red-cell production be stimulated in a patient’s body? (9) What techniques are being used to minimize blood loss during surgery? (10) Can transfusion alternatives work for young children or for people involved in lifethreatening emergencies? (11) What is one of the primary ethical principles of good medical care? (12) Why is it important for Christians to make nonblood treatment choices in advance? How can we do this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Acceptance of some of the treatments featured in the video is a matter for private decision in accord with each one’s Bible-trained conscience. Have you taken a clear position on which medical treatments and procedures you are willing to accept for yourself and your children and then filled out a DPA card? For a complete discussion of these matters, carefully review chapter 7 of the “God’s Love” book and the references mentioned therein. See also the insert “How Do I View Blood Fractions and Medical Procedures Involving My Own Blood?” in the November 2006 issue of Our Kingdom Ministry. Finally, be sure you have accurately transferred your choices to your DPA card. Your selected health-care agents and any non-Witness family members should be fully informed of your decisions.</span></p>

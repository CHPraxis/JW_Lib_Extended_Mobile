<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Our Priority</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The ministry was Jesus’ priority. He expended himself, walking hundreds of miles throughout Palestine to preach to as many as possible. He kept his life simple so he could devote more time and attention to the ministry. (Matt. 8:20) When crowds tried to detain him so that he would cure their sick, he said: “Also to other cities I </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">must</span><span class="font12"> declare the good news of the king-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. How did Jesus demonstrate that the ministry was important to him? </span><span class="font12">dom of God, because for this I was sent forth.”—Luke 4:43.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Why was the ministry so important to Jesus? His prime concern was the sanctification of Jehovah’s name. (Matt. 6:9) He loved his heavenly Father and so desired to accomplish His will and obey His every commandment. (John 14:31) In addition, he genuinely cared for people and wanted to help them.—Matt. 9:36, 37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Imitate Jesus: Maintaining the same focus Jesus had can be challenging because the world makes heavy demands on our time and offers many distractions. (Matt. 24:37-39; Luke 21:34) Therefore, we must make sure of the more important things, scheduling time to prepare for and engage in the preaching work regularly. (Phil. 1:10) We endeavor to maintain a simple lifestyle and avoid using the world to the full. —1 Cor. 7:31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> When time is limited, a wise person prioritizes. If he learned that a dangerous storm was approaching, for example, he would focus his time and energy on making arrangements for the safety of his family and warning his neighbors. Less important activities would wait. The time left before the storm of Armageddon arrives is reduced. (Zeph. 1:14-16; 1 Cor. 7:29) In order to save ourselves and those who listen to us, we must pay constant attention to ourselves and our teaching, be it inside or outside the congregation. (1 Tim. 4:16) Yes, our survival depends upon keeping the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">mini</span><span class="font12">stry our priority!</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Am I Doing Enough?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Have you ever asked yourself that question? Perhaps your share in the ministry has diminished because of advancing age, health issues, or increased family responsibilities, causing you discouragement. One sister with three children wrote that some-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. What concerns might a faithful Christian have?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">times she feels guilty because the time and energy needed to care for her family limits what she can do in the ministry. What will help us to view matters in a balanced way?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> What Jehovah Expects of Us: No doubt, all of us would like to do more in the ministry. But there often is a big difference between what we would like to do and what we realistically can do. The fact that we would like to do more shows that we are not complacent. We should remember that Jehovah well knows our limitations and does not require more than we can reasonably do. (Ps. 103:13, 14) What does he expect of us? He wants us to serve him whole-souled, to give him our best.—Col. 3:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> What will assist us in determining what is realistic for ourselves? We can ask Jehovah to help us to see our situation objectively. (Ps. 26:2) A trusted, mature Christian friend who knows us well and who is not afraid to tell us whether we need to improve may also be of assistance. (Prov. 27:9) Remember, too, that since circumstances change, it is beneficial to evaluate our situation regularly.—Eph. 5:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> How to View Reminders: During a race, well-wishers often call out encouragement. The purpose is to help the runners to reach their goal, not to demoralize them. Similarly, the Bible-based encouragement and reminders given at our meetings and in our publications to ‘preach the word urgently’ are for our benefit and are not to imply that our efforts are in some way insufficient. (2 Tim. 4:2) We can be confident that as long as we keep trying to do our best, Jehovah will remember our ‘love and works’ with favor.—Heb. 6:10.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>“Wisdom Is Proved Righteous by Its Works”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> At times we may encounter a negative response from householders who misunderstand us or who have been misinformed about Jehovah’s Witnesses. Perhaps their viewpoint has been influenced by biased media reports. In some places we have </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">even</span><span class="font12"> been labeled “a dangerous sect.” How</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. How is our work perceived by some? </span><span class="font12">should we react when faced with such criticism?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Maintain a Positive Attitude: Jesus and other servants of Jehovah in the first century were often misunderstood and maligned. (Acts 28:22) Yet, they did not allow criticism to make them feel ashamed of their ministry. Jesus said: “Wisdom is proved righteous by its works.” (Matt. 11: 18, 19) He continued doing his Father’s will with zeal, confident that the value of the good news would be apparent to truthseekers. We can avoid discouragement by remembering that God’s own Son experienced similar treatment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Jesus indicated that the world would hate his followers just as it hated him. (John 15:18-20) Therefore, negative reports and opposition today should not surprise us. In fact, we should expect such things to become more common the deeper we move into the last days and the more Satan’s anger intensifies. (Rev. 12:12) We can rejoice in this indication that Satan’s world is running out of time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Respond With Graciousness: When we receive a negative response, we should always reply with graciousness and mildness. (Prov. 15:1; Col. 4:5, 6) If the situation allows, we may be able to explain to a sincere householder that there is much misinformation about Jehovah’s Witnesses or to ask him why he feels the way he does. Our mild response may cause him to question what he has heard about Jehovah’s Witnesses and to listen the next time a Witness visits. However, if the householder is very angry, it may be best to excuse ourselves. We can be certain that regardless of how others view us, Jehovah values our </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">mini</span><span class="font12">stry.—Isa. 52:7.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Instructions for Those Handling Service Meeting Parts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Beginning with this issue of Our Kingdom Ministry, the wording of the Service Meeting schedule is being simplified. The following instructions and reminders will update and clarify what was stated in the article “How to Prepare for the Service Meeting,” which appeared in the May 2009 Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Talk: </span><span class="font10">This refers to a discourse based on the assigned material with no audience participation. The speaker should focus on what will be most helpful to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Questions and Answers: </span><span class="font10">Much like the Watchtower Study, this part has a very brief introduction and conclusion, and questions are asked on all the paragraphs. The conductor should avoid commenting excessively. Key scriptures may be read as time allows. Paragraphs are not to be read unless instructions are given to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Discussion: </span><span class="font10">This is a talk that includes some audience participation. It is not simply a talk, and it is not all questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Demonstrations and Interviews: </span><span class="font10">Instr uctions to demonstrate mean that the brother assigned the part is responsible for including a demonstration; he personally does not have to give the demonstration. Those he chooses to help him should be capable and exemplary, and he should make arrangements with them well in advance if possible. It is best not to use new and inexperienced publishers to demonstrate how the work is to be done simply to give them the opportunity to be on the platform, although some can be used as householders. Publishers demonstrating a presentation should take care to face the audience. Those used in an interview are to give their comments from the platform rather than from their seat. Demonstrations and interviews should be rehearsed. If the meeting is running overtime and a brother must shorten his part, he will avoid deleting demonstrations or interviews. Ministerial servants should check with the coordinator of the body of elders or another elder before selecting participants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If a unique part has special instructions, these should be carefully followed. By delivering Service Meeting parts as outlined above, brothers will contribute to Service Meetings that “take place decently and by arrange-ment.”—1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p>

Have you ever asked any of these?” After getting the householder’s response, consider together from the tract the answer to one of his questions, and read one of the cited scriptures. Then explain that this is just a sampling of what the Bible teaches, and hand him a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font11"> book. We could then discuss the opening paragraphs of a chapter that he selects from the table of contents. Or we may choose to turn to where more information is found on the subject we discussed from the tract. Here are references that we might use:</span></p></li></ul>

Also during May 2010, nearly 12.6 million magazines were distributed. In the Turks and Caicos Islands, an all-time peak of 719 Bible studies was reported. May we all continue to ‘buy out the opportune time’ for the never-to-be-repeated preaching work!—Eph. 5:16.</span></p>

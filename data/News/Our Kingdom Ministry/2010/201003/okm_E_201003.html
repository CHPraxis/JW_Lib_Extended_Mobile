<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Expressing Gratitude for God’s Greatest Gift</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Of Jehovah’s many ‘good gifts,’ the ransom provided by his dear Son is the greatest. (Jas. 1:17) It makes possible many blessings, including forgiveness of our sins. (Eph. 1:7) For this we are always grateful. During the Memorial season, we particularly take time to meditate on this pre</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">cious</span><span class="font11"> gift.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. Why are we especially grateful to Jehovah?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Build Appreciation: So as to build your family’s appreciation, in the weeks preceding the Memorial on March 30, why not use time during your Family Worship evening to review information on the ransom? Also consider the special Memorial Bible reading each day as a family. Personally reflect on how the ransom has benefited you and affected your view of Jehovah, yourself, others, and the future. You will also find it advantageous to practice singing the two new songs that will be used at the Memorial, numbers 8 and 109. —Ps. 77:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Expressions of Gratitude: Appreciation for the ransom moves us to tell others about Jehovah and his great love in sending his Son. (Ps. 145:2-7) During March, April, and May, some families express their gratitude by arranging for at least one family member to auxiliary pioneer. If this is not possible, can you ‘buy out time’ to enlarge your share in the ministry? (Eph. 5: 16) Gratitude will also motivate us to help others to attend the Memorial with us. (Rev. 22:17) Begin making up a list of return visits, Bible students, relatives, workmates, and neighbors to invite, and then have a full share in the special Memorial invitation campaign.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The Memorial season provides new opportunities to demonstrate to Jehovah how much we appreciate his gift to mankind. May we use this time to build and express our gratitude for the ransom and all “the unfathomable riches of the Christ.” </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">—Eph</span><span class="font11">. 3:8.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Sanctifies Jehovah’s Name: The preaching work emphasizes that Jehovah’s Kingdom by Christ Jesus will replace all human governments and provide solutions to all that ails mankind. (Matt. 6: 9, 10) Jehovah is magnified as the only one able to rescue us from sickness and death. (Isa. 25:8; 33:24) Since we bear his name, others who observe our fine conduct and zeal may glorify him. (1 Pet. 2: 12) How satisfying it is for us to make known throughout the earth the name of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah!—Ps. 83:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Saves Lives: Jehovah “does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9) Yet, without someone to teach them, how would people ever learn what Jehovah considers to be proper or improper conduct? (Jonah 4:11; Rom. 10:13-15) When individuals respond to the good news, the quality of their lives improves as they abandon harmful practices. (Mic. 4:1-4) Furthermore, they gain the joyful prospect of everlasting life. Our active preaching and teaching saves us and those who listen to us. (1 Tim. 4:16) What a highly honored role we have in this most important work!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Soon the great tribulation will bring an abrupt end to this unrighteous world. Those who take Jehovah’s side will survive. Thus, preaching and making disciples is the most urgent, important, and beneficial work taking place today. Let us give it the foremost place in our lives! —Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark3"></a>The Fields Are White for Harvesting</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> After witnessing to a Samaritan woman, Jesus told his disciples: “Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting.” (John 4: 35, 36) A spiritual harvest was under way, and Jesus could foresee the worldwide scope of that work. From his posi</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">tion</span><span class="font14"> in the heavens, Jesus remains very</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">1. What important work is under way? </span><span class="font14">involved in the harvest. (Matt. 28:19, 20) What indications are there that this work continues to intensify as it moves toward its climax?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12"> A Global Harvest: </span><span class="font14">During the 2009 service year, there was a 3.2 percent increase in publishers worldwide. Lands where the preaching work is restricted saw a 14 percent increase. The number of home Bible studies reported monthly surpassed 7,619,000—a number greater than the peak of publishers and almost a half million more than the number of studies reported the previous year. As the work rapidly expands in many regions, more requests are received for Gilead-trained missionaries. The foreign-language fields are producing an abundant yield in country after country. It is apparent that Jehovah is speeding up the work during the conclusion of the harvest. (Isa. 60:22) Do you have a positive view of your “fields”?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12"> Your Local Harvest: </span><span class="font14">“My territory is not very productive,” some may say. It is true that some territories do not appear to be as productive as others or to be as fruitful as they were in the past. Some Witnesses may therefore conclude that the harvest has peaked in those areas and that now their work is reduced to gleaning a few remaining ones. Is that really the case?</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font13">4. What proper attitude toward our ministry should we cultivate, and why?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">time of intense activity. Notice the sense of urgency in these words of Jesus: “The harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” (Matt. 9:37, 38) Jehovah, the Master of the harvest, is responsible for when and where the yield occurs. (John 6:44; 1 Cor. 3:6-8) What is our assignment? The Bible answers: “In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest.” (Eccl. 11:4-6) Yes, when the harvest is reaching its climax is not the time to let our hand rest!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font12"> Keep Harvesting: </span><span class="font14">Even if our territory has been covered repeatedly and seems unresponsive, there is good reason to work with zeal and a sense of urgency. (2 Tim. 4:2) Dramatic upheavals on the world scene cause people to change their attitude and think more seriously about the future. As youths grow older, they may feel the need to find security and peace of mind. Our persistence may impress still others. Yes, those who have not listened in the past may yet respond. Even those who purposely reject our message need to be warned.—Ezek. 2:4, 5; 3:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> If our territory is challenging, what will help us to maintain zeal? Perhaps we can supplement our house-to-house</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">preaching with other forms of the ministry, such as business or telephone witnessing. Or we could vary our presentation so as to have a fresh approach. We might change our schedule and engage in the ministry in the evening or at other times when people are more likely to be at home. Perhaps we can pursue learning a new language in order to reach more with the good news. We may be able to expand our ministry by regular pioneering. Or we can move to a place where there are fewer harvest workers. If we have the right attitude toward the harvest, we will endeavor to have as full a share as possible in this important work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Farmers have a limited amount of time to gather the crops, so they do not relax or slow down until the work is finished. The spiritual harvest requires the same sense of urgency. Until when should we continue in the ingathering work? Throughout “the conclusion of the system of things” and until “the end.” (Matt. 24:14; 28:20) Like Jehovah’s foremost Minister, we want to finish the work that has been entrusted to us. (John 4:34; 17:4) Let us therefore continue to carry out our ministry with zeal, joy, and a positive attitude until the end. (Matt. 24:13) The harvest is not over!</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font18"><a name="bookmark9"></a>■ </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">In what practical ways can we assist pioneers?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">Around the world during the 2009 service year, nearly 800,000 brothers and sisters served as regular and special pioneers. These full-time servants sacrifice the firstfruits of their time, energy, and material resources in order to spread the Kingdom good news. (Prov. 3:9) How Jehovah must be pleased with their efforts! In what ways can we reflect Jehovah’s view and contribute to their joy and endurance in this avenue of service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Certainly our well-chosen words may encourage them to continue serving as pioneers. (Prov. 25:11) Could we adjust our weekly schedule in order to work with them in the ministry? When working together, we might suggest using our vehicle instead of theirs. And if we ride in their vehicle, perhaps we could offer a contribution to help cover their expenses. (1 Cor. 13:5; Phil. 2:4) We also demonstrate our loving support by showing hospitality and occasionally inviting pioneers to our home for a meal.—1 Pet. 4:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The Scriptures guarantee that Jehovah will provide the necessities for those who seek his Kingdom first. (Ps. 37:25; Matt. 6:33) One way that he does this is by means of our loving Christian brotherhood. (1 John 3:16-18) Of course, pioneers do not expect their financial responsibilities to be cared for by others. And they may not take the initiative to let others know when they experience a need. However, we can help faithful pioneers and “offset their deficiency” in practical ways by being alert and ob-servant.—2 Cor. 8:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When Phoebe, a zealous evangelizer in the first-century Cenchreae Congregation, traveled to Rome, Paul encouraged the brothers in Rome: “Welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the holy ones, and . . . assist her in any matter where she may need you.” (Rom. 16:1, 2) We have the opportunity to demonstrate the same loving support of those in our congregation who are declaring the good news without letup as regular and special pioneers.—Acts 5:42.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">ing husband or wife? If so, no doubt these publishers desire that their mate join them in true worship. But they are not the only ones. The entire congregation mirrors God’s desire that “all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) How may we reach out to the unbelieving mates of publishers in our congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> First, we should try to see matters from the unbeliever’s viewpoint. Many unbelieving mates love their family and try to be a good marriage mate and parent. Perhaps they have sincere religious beliefs that are different from ours. They may know little about Jehovah’s Witnesses except what uninformed or prejudiced associates have told them. Some resent the time their spouse uses for worship that was formerly spent with the family. Insight will help us to treat an unbeliever kindly and respectfully and avoid being unduly nervous when we are around him.—Prov. 16:20-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font14">Personal Interest: </span><span class="font15">The best way to win over an unbelieving mate to the truth, at least initially, may be through our actions, not through a Bible discussion.

<p><span class="font15">in the congregation can take an interest in an unbelieving wife, and brothers can do the same with an unbelieving husband. How?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> If you have not yet met the spouse, perhaps you could do so after consulting with the Christian mate. Do not be disappointed if the unbeliever’s initial response is lukewarm. Our friendliness and personal interest may move him to view Jehovah’ s Witnesses more favorably. (Rom. 12:20) Some mature Christians have invited an unbeliever and his family to dinner, with a view to getting better acquainted and breaking down any prejudice that may exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">They have talked about his interests, rather than forcing the conversation toward spiritual subjects. Later, when the unbeliever feels more comfortable, a Scriptural discussion may be possible. Or he may be receptive to an invitation to attend one of our meetings to see what his wife is learning, especially since he already knows some in the congregation. Even if he is not ready to investigate the truth, he can certainly be</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">commended for the support given to his believing mate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>5</sup> Elders especially should reach out to unbelieving mates and be alert for opportunities to give a witness. An unbeliever who has not been receptive to a Bible discussion may listen to Scriptural encouragement when he is in the hospital or encounters serious health problems. If a divided household experiences a crisis, such as the death of a family member, the elders may invite the unbeliever to sit in when they give comfort to the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>6</sup> Imagine the joy that will be experienced by a Christian in our congregation if his or her spouse responds and comes into the truth! Such a happy event would also bring great joy to Jehovah, the angels, and the rest of the congregation. (Luke 15:7, 10) However, if the unbeliever is not initially responsive, we can still rejoice that our continued efforts please Jehovah, who “does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.”—2 Pet. 3:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jesus had spent the evening healing people and expelling demons. When his disciples found him the next day, they said: “All are looking for you,” urging him to continue his powerful works. However, Jesus would not be sidetracked </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">from</span><span class="font14"> his primary work of preaching the</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">1. What helped Jesus to avoid becoming sidetracked from his primary work? </span><span class="font14">good news. He replied: “Let us go somewhere else, into the village towns nearby, that I may preach there also, for it is for this purpose I have gone out.” What helped Jesus to maintain his focus? He had risen early to pray and meditate. (Mark 1:32-39) How can prayerful meditation also help us to be zealous preachers?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"> Meditate on What? </span><span class="font14">Jesus observed that people were “skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.” (Matt. 9:36) Similarly, we can reflect on how much people need the good news. We might contemplate the urgency of the times. (1 Cor. 7:29) We can ponder Jehovah’s works and qualities, our privilege to be Jehovah’s Witnesses, and the precious spiritual treasures we have learned from God’s Word that are still unknown by people in our territory.—Ps. 77:11-13; Isa. 43:10-12; Matt. 13:52.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"> Meditate When? </span><span class="font14">As Jesus did, some rise early when it is quiet. Others find it best to meditate in the evening before going to sleep. (Gen. 24:63) Even with a busy schedule, we can find time for meditation. Some do so while taking public transportation. Others use part of their lunch break for undisturbed contemplation. Many find that meditating before sharing in the ministry, even for a few moments, helps them to preach with greater zeal and boldness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Prayerful meditation will deepen our desire to serve Jehovah, sharpen our spiritual focus, and strengthen our resolve to continue preaching. God’s Chief Minister, Jesus, benefited from meditation, and so will we.</span></p></li></ul>

Thus far in the 2010 service year, 4.3 million more hours have been devoted to the ministry than in the same period of the previous service year. The Turks and Caicos Islands had their second consecutive all-time peak, with 256 publishers. This is a 12.8 percent increase over the previous service year. Truly, Jehovah’s people are “zealous for fine works”!—Titus 2:14.</span></p>

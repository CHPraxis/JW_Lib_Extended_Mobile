I’m here to give you and your family this invitation to attend. Your friends are also welcome. Please note the time and location of this local observance.” Depending on the circumstances, you may choose to read Luke 22:19 from the Bible to point out the Scriptural command. Keep in mind, however, that since we have a limited time to cover the territory, it is best to be brief.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If your congregation has a large territory, the elders may direct you to leave the invitations at not-at-homes the first time you call. When it is appropriate, offer the magazines in addition to using the invitation.

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“Come Be My Follower”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The four Gospel accounts of Jesus’ life on earth paint an intimate portrait of the Son of God. Since Christians are to “follow his steps closely,” we will want to prepare well and pay close attention as we consider the book “Come Be My Follower” at the Congregation Bible Study beginning the week of March 1. (1 Pet. 2:21; Mark 10:21) Worthy of special consideration are the aspects of Jesus’ life that can en</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">coura</span><span class="font10">ge us in the ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What opportunity will the Congregation Bible Study afford us in the coming months?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Example Set by Jesus: Have you ever met with a negative response while preaching from house to house? When we face such resistance, Jesus’ words ring clear: “If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also.” ( John 15:20) True, not all negative replies are a form of persecution. Nevertheless, it was the joy set before him that enabled Jesus to endure all sorts of tests and trials. We too can focus on gaining Jehovah’s smile of approval and the reward for our faithfulness. This will help us not to ‘get tired and give out in our souls.’ (Heb. 12:2, 3; Prov. 27:11) As we persevere in the ministry, we can also be confident of Christ Jesus’ support.—Matt. 28:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> “For This I Was Sent Forth”: Kingdompreaching activity occupied the primary place in Jesus’ life. (Luke 4:43) He gave generously of himself in the ministry. He treated it as urgent, always seeking opportunities to speak about the Kingdom. Since we are followers of Jesus, where do his footsteps lead us? As we go about our daily routine, are there people with whom we can share the good news? May the love the Christ has compel us to give the good news the widest possible distribution!—2 Cor. 5:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> “Never Has Another Man Spoken Like This”: Jesus’ way of teaching astounded his listeners. ( John 7:46; Matt. 7:28, 29) What set him apart from other teachers? He loved the truths he imparted, he loved the people he taught, and he used various teaching methods. By imitating the Great Teacher, we can improve the quality of our ministry.—Luke 6:40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> These are a few of the gems revealed in the life of Jesus. What other treasures can you find? As you examine the life of Jesus during the Congregation Bible Study, make it your aim to “know the love of the Christ” by imi</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">tating</span><span class="font10"> his words and deeds.—Eph. 3:19.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">2. How can Jesus’ example of endurance benefit us?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. How can we imitate Jesus’ view of the ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. In what ways can we improve the quality of our ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">5. What should be our goal as we study “Come Be My Follower”?</span></p>

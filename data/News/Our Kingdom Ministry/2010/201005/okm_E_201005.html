<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. How do we know that nothing can stop the preaching work?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Though Judge Gideon and his 300 men faced seemingly impossible odds against an army of 135,000 Midianites, Jehovah told him: “You will certainly save Israel out of Midian’s palm. Do I not send you?” (Judg. 6:14) What work has Jehovah’s backing today? Jesus said: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth.” (Matt. 24:14) No one will be able to stop this work from being accomplished!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah Helps Us Personally: While we can be confident that Jehovah will make his Witnesses successful as a group, can we expect Jehovah to help us personally? During a time of need, the apostle Paul felt Jehovah’s personal support through his Son, Jesus. (2 Tim. 4:17) We can be confident that Jehovah will likewise bless our individual efforts to accomplish his will.—1 John 5:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Do the daily cares of life leave you with little energy for the ministry? “He is giving to the tired one power.” (Isa. 40:29-31) Are you facing persecution or opposition? “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you.” (Ps. 55:22) Do you sometimes lack confidence? “Go, and I myself shall prove to be with your mouth.” (Ex. 4:11, 12) Do you have health problems that limit your share in the ministry? Jehovah values and can use your whole-souled efforts, no matter how small.—1 Cor. 3:6, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah’s hand “is the one stretched out, and who can turn it back?” (Isa. 14:27) Confident of Jehovah’s blessing upon our ministry, may we continue without letup preaching “with boldness by the authority of Jehovah.”—Acts 14:3.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> For Ourselves: </span><span class="font11">We should pray on each occasion that we preach. (Eph. 6:18) What are some things for which to pray? We could pray for a positive attitude about our territory and for boldness. (Acts 4:29) We could ask Jehovah to direct us to right-hearted individuals with whom we may study the Bible. If the householder asks us a question, we can say a brief silent prayer asking Jehovah to help us make a proper reply. (Neh. 2:4) We may also ask for wisdom to keep the ministry our priority. (Jas. 1:5) In addition, Jehovah is pleased when we include expressions of thankfulness for the privilege of being his ministers.—Col. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> For Others: </span><span class="font11">We should also “pray for one another,” even mentioning fellow ministers by name when appropriate. (Jas. 5:16; Acts 12:5) Does failing health limit what you can do in the preaching work? Then pray for fellow ministers who are in good health. Never underestimate the force of your prayers in their behalf! It is also proper to pray for the authorities to be favorably disposed toward the preaching work, so that our brothers “may go on leading a calm and quiet life.”—1 Tim. 2: 1, 2.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Declaring the good news in all the inhabited earth is a daunting assignment. If we “persevere in prayer,” we will accomplish the work with Jehovah’s help.—Rom. 12:12.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>“You Would Make a Good Pioneer!”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “I could not have found any other work that could have brought me as much contentment or could have been so spiritually rewarding.” So said Kathe B. Palm. She spent decades as a selfless pioneer minister witnessing from one end of Chile, </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">Sout</span><span class="font13">h America, to the other. Think-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">1. How did one sister feel about her pioneer ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ing of the rewarding life of those in full-time service, perhaps someone has said to you: “You would make a good pioneer!”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12"> A Satisfying Way of Life: </span><span class="font13">Our Model, Jesus, found genuine refreshment in doing his Father’s will. (John 4:34) Therefore, it was with sincerity that Jesus taught his followers that real satisfaction results from engaging in activities related to the worship of Jehovah. We are content when our lives are filled with works that bring Jehovah’s approval. Additionally, as we give more time, energy, and resources to help others, we increase our happi-ness.—Acts 20:31, 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The more time we spend in the ministry, the more opportunities we have to experience the joy of starting and conducting Bible studies. Even where many householders seem apathetic, we may find that our territory is more productive than we first thought as we gain experience and skill in the ministry. Pioneers can utilize the wealth of education they receive at the Pioneer Service School after pioneering for about one year. (2 Tim. 2: 15) As we persevere, we may very well be planting seeds of truth that will produce fruitage at a later time. —Eccl. 11:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">2 . Explain why deep satisfaction is gained from spiritual activities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3 . What joy may we experience from spending increased time in the ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font12"> Youths: </span><span class="font13">While you are finishing your basic education, have you given careful thought to your future? Until now, your schoolwork largely determined your schedule. How will you fill that vacuum after graduation? Instead of pursuing a secular career, why not prayerfully consider the goal of regular pioneering? The skills you will learn—witnessing to people of different backgrounds, overcoming personal obstacles, cultivating self-discipline, and developing teaching ability—will benefit you throughout life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Parents, are you doing your part in pointing your children toward full-time service? Your words and positive example can do much to help them put Kingdom interests first. (Matt. 6:33) Ray, who started pioneering when finishing high school, recalls: “My mom always felt that pioneering results in a most satisfying way of life.” All in the congregation can encourage pioneer service by their words and support. Jose, from Spain, states: “My congregation viewed the pioneer work as the best</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">career for young ones. Their comments and appreciation for the pioneer service along with their practical help made it easier for me to start pioneering.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font13"> Overcoming Obstacles: </span><span class="font14">But what if you say, ‘I do not have the desire to pioneer.’ If that is the way you feel at first, pray to Jehovah about the way you feel and tell him, ‘I do not know if pioneering is for me, but I want to do what is pleasing to you.’ (Ps. 62:8; Prov. 23:26) Then look for his direction through his Word and organization. Many regular pioneers first “tasted” pioneering as auxiliary pioneers, and the joy they experienced moved them to pursue a career in fulltime service.—Ps. 34:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> What if you are not sure that you can meet the monthly requirement of 70 hours? Why not speak to pioneers having circumstances similar to yours? (Prov. 15:22) Then write out several possible schedules. You may find that buying out time for the ministry from nonessen-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">6. What may we do if we do not currently have the desire to pioneer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">7. How may we overcome doubts that we can reach the monthly requirement of 70 hours?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">tial activities is easier than you first thought.—Eph. 5:15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Take a Fresh Look: </span><span class="font14">Personal circumstances often change. It is good to reevaluate your situation from time to time. For example, are you nearing retirement from secular employment? Randy, who retired early, says: “This decision has enabled me to start regular pioneering along with my wife, and it has given us the opportunity to move and serve where the need is greater. I have received innumerable blessings for my decision, but the greatest blessing of all is a good conscience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> Some couples have found after a careful examination that both do not have to work full-time. True, this may require the family to simplify their lifestyle, but it is worth the sacrifice. John, whose wife recently quit her full-time job in order to expand her ministry, relates: “There is no better feeling than to know that my wife is involved in spiritual things during the day.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">8. Why should we periodically reevaluate our circumstances?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">9. What should married couples consider?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah has made preaching the most important work any of us could do.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Demonstration of Love and Faith: </span><span class="font14">Jehovah has made preaching the most important work any of us could do. This old system is soon to be destroyed, and only those calling on Jehovah’s name will be saved. (Rom. 10:13) A heart full of love for him and gratitude for what he has done for us will motivate us to obey the commission from his Son to preach zealously. (Matt. 28:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">19, 20; 1 John 5:3) In addition, having faith that we are indeed living in the last days will move us to do all we can in the ministry while there is yet time, rather than using the world to the full.—1 Cor. 7:29-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>11</sup> Regular pioneering is more than a response to an organizational arrangement; it is an expression of our devotion to God. So if someone tells you that you would make a good pioneer, view it as a compliment. And give prayerful consideration to joining those who are engaged in this satisfying avenue of service.</span></p>

Therefore, rather than simply </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">offering</span><span class="font14"> a study, why not take a couple of minutes to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">demonstrate</span><span class="font14"> the Bible study arrangement on the initial call? To illustrate: Do not just tell them that you are a good cook and offer to come back with a meal; give them a taste right away! Here is how you can do that in only a few minutes, based on a suggestion from page 6 of the January 2006 Our </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Do you think the day will ever come when these words are fulfilled? [Read Isaiah 33:24, and allow for response.] Let me show you something interesting on the subject.” Hand the householder a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font14"> book, and refer him to paragraph 22 on page 36. Read the question at the bottom of the page, and ask the householder to look for the answer as you read the paragraph. Then ask the question again, and listen to the householder’s comment. Read another of the scriptures together. Raise a question to be answered on the next visit, and make definite arrangements to return. You have just started a Bible study!</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Do you remember the first time you engaged in the house-to-house ministry? Likely, you were very nervous. If you were working with your Bible teacher or another publisher, you were no doubt happy to have his assistance. Now that you have gained experience as a minister, you are in a position to help train newer ones to preach.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> New publishers need to learn how to start conversations with the householder, use the Bible at the door, make return visits, and start and conduct Bible studies. They should also learn how to share in different avenues of preaching, such as street witnessing and calling on people at places of business. You can help them to improve in these areas both by your example and by your suggestions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Teach by Example: </span><span class="font11">Jesus demonstrated to his disciples how to preach. (Luke 8:1; 1 Pet. 2:21) When you arrange to work with a newer publisher, prepare a simple presentation that the publisher can imitate, perhaps using a sample found in one of our publications. Then offer to take the first door or two so that the publisher can hear what you say. Between doors, you might ask the publisher for his observations on the effectiveness of your presentation. This will help him see the value of working with others in the ministry and will make it easier for him to accept any suggestions you offer after he gives his presentation.</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. How may we help others by our example? 4. How may we help a new publisher after listening to his presentation? </span><span class="font11">disciples instructions on how to preach. (Matt. 10:5-14) You can help a new publisher in a similar way. When it is his turn to speak, listen carefully. Then after you leave the door, be generous in giving specific and sincere commendation, even if you observed aspects of his presentation needing improvement. Before offering a suggestion, you may choose to see whether he has improved in that aspect at the next door. Perhaps he was just nervous. Keep in mind, too, that publishers do not all have the same abilities, and there is often more than one correct way to do something.—1 Cor. 12:4-7.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Sometimes a new publisher will ask you for suggestions. But if he does not, take the initiative to help him. How can this be done tactfully? Some experienced publishers simply ask, “May I give you a suggestion?” or, “How do you think that went?” Another option is to say, “When I was a new publisher, I found ita challenge to...,butIfoundthistobehelpful....”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">Sometimes it is beneficial to consult the Reasoning book together. So that you do not overwhelm him, offer suggestions on only one aspect of his presentation.</span></p>

(1 Tim. 4:13, 15) Though it may be that it has been years since your first time in the ministry, you should never stop trying to improve your skills. Learn from the publishers with whom you preach, even those who have less experience in the ministry, and be alert to help others kindly, especially newer ones, to become skillful min</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">isters</span><span class="font11"> of the good news.—Prov. 27:17.</span></p></li></ul>

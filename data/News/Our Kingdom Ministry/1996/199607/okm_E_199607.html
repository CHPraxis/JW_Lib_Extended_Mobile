<p><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">July 1996 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 39, No. 7</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Fulfilling Our Vow Day After Day</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> The psalmist David was moved to declare to Jehovah: “I will make melody to your name forever, that I may pay my vows day after day.” (Ps. 61:8) David knew that the making of a vow is a wholly voluntary matter. However, he also appreciated that if he made a vow, he was obligated to fulfill it. Even so, he praised Jehovah for the opportunity to fulfill his vows day after day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> When we made our dedication to Jehovah, we willingly vowed to do his will. We disowned ourselves and made serving Jehovah our primary pursuit in life. (Luke 9:23) Hence, we too must pay our vow day after day. (Eccl. 5:4-6) Our public declaration made at the time of water baptism must be reflected in our entire pattern of life, since we know that “with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.” (Rom. 10: 10) This includes preaching the good news. (Heb. 13:15) Personal circumstances vary greatly, but day after day all of us can keep in focus the importance of sharing the good news with others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Make Opportunities to Preach Daily: </span><span class="font7">Sharing the good news with someone else is a joyful experience. In order to do this daily, we have to make opportunities to preach whenever our circumstances permit. Many happy experiences have been enjoyed by those who have taken the initiative to witness informally to individuals at work or in school and to neighbors or others they encounter each day. Even writing letters or using the telephone can be a means of witnessing to others. Taking advantage of all these means as well as setting aside time regularly for witnessing from door to door and making return visits can lead to the special joy that comes from conducting a home Bible study. Yes, each day we may be able to create opportunities to preach.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> A sister began reading </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Examining the Scriptures Daily</span><span class="font7"> during her work break. She invited a workmate to read the day’s text with her, and that soon led to a Bible study with the woman. They studied for half an hour each day, five days a week. Another workmate observed their daily study. He eventually identified himself as an inactive brother. Moved by the sister’s zeal, he contacted an elder in order to become reactivated. This sister touched two other lives in a positive way because of following through in fulfilling her vow day after day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> When we are motivated by a heart brimming with appreciation for all the good things Jehovah has done for us, fulfilling our dedication vow as best we can each day will bring us joy and satisfaction. Like the psalmist, we can declare: “I laud you, O Jehovah my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify your name to time indefinite.”—Ps. 86:12.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Tried Evening Witnessing?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">' All of us find pleasure in being productive in our work. On the other hand, when we are unable to see positive results, work can become tedious and unfulfilling. Meaningful labor is personally rewarding, and it is a blessing. (Compare Ecclesiastes 3: 10-13.) We can apply this principle to our preaching work. We know from experience that when we go from door to door and are able to converse with people about the Bible, we return home spiritually refreshed. We feel that we have really accomplished something.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> In some areas it has become very difficult to find people at home during certain hours of the day. Reports indicate that in many places more than 50 percent of the people are not at home when we call early in the day. Many congregations have dealt with this problem by making arrangements for evening witnessing, and they have met with good success. Publishers report that when they call later in the day, more people are at home, and in general, people tend to be more relaxed and more inclined to listen to the Kingdom message. Have you tried evening witnessing in your territory?—Compare Mark 1:32-34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Eldar* Organize Evening Witnessing: </span><span class="font7">In some areas meetings for field service in the late afternoon or early evening have been well supported. Consideration can be given to young publishers who get out of school in the afternoon and to adults who have finished their secular work by later in the day. Some publishers who are not able to be out in field service on weekends find that evening witnessing during the week is a practical way for them to have a regular share in the preaching work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> There are various activities you can engage in during evening witnessing. You can witness from house to house with magazines or use the literature offer for the month. Evening is a fine time to call on people who were not at home when publishers called earlier in the day or on weekends. There might also be good territory for street witnessing, allowing you to contact people coming home from work. Many find that the evening is the best time to make return visits on those who have shown interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Be Cautious and Discreet: </span><span class="font7">Going out at dusk or after dark could be hazardous in certain areas. It would be wise to travel in pairs or groups on well-lit streets and visit homes or apartment buildings only where there is some assurance that you will be safe. When you knock at the door, stand where you can be seen, and clearly identify yourself. Be discerning. When you observe that you have called at an inopportune time, as when the family is eating, offer to call at another time. Usually it is best to confine your witnessing to the early evening hours, rather than make late calls, when householders may be getting ready to retire for the night.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Long summer evenings are particularly appropriate for evening witnessing. As we render God “sacred service day and night,” Jehovah will certainly bless our efforts.—Rev. 7:15.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Paul urged us ‘always to have plenty to do in the work of the Lord.’ (1 Cor. 15:58) For many, this means taking up the pioneer service. This past September, more than 5,000 were added to the pioneer ranks!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Presently the greater number of those serving as pioneers in this country are sisters. (Ps. 68:11) What a Joy it would be for the congregation if more brothers could Join the ranks of full-time servants! (Ps. 110:3) It is understandable that many brothers have to care for heavy secular and family obligations. Others also work hard to care for the spiritual needs of the congregation. We appreciate these men who are exerting themselves in behalf of the Kingdom. —I Tim. 4:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Even so, could more of you brothers take up pioneer service? If your wife is pioneering, can you Join her? If you are retired, would you not agree that there Is no more satisfying way to spend your time than In the fulltime ministry? If you are Just finishing school, have you given serious and prayerful thought to taking up the pioneer service as a steppingstone to additional privileges of service?—Eph. 5:15-17.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> A Large Door Ie Open: </span><span class="font7">Pioneer service can open “a large door that leads to activity.” (1 Cor. 16:9) Brothers who are pioneers may be used extensively in the congregation. Zealous field activity adds to their spiritual stature and contributes to their theocratic progress. Pioneering can open up the way to added privileges of service. After the first year of pioneering, there is the blessing of attending Pioneer Service School. Single ministerial servants and elders may reach out to attend the Ministerial Training School. Married couples who are qualified may apply for Gilead School. Brothers may eventually quality for the traveling work. Yes, the pioneer ministry opens the door to these greater privileges of service in Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Brothers who can make room for regular pioneer service may experience the greater happiness that comes with Increased giving.—Acts 20:35.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>New Circuit Assembly Program</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> The new circuit assembly program beginning in September will develop the theme “Experience the Greater Happiness in Giving.” (Acts 20:35) Happiness is described as “a state of well-being and contentment.&quot; Most people today snatch whatever pleasure they can from life, and when they do, it often is temporary. That is not true happiness. Yet, Jehovah teaches us how to benefit ourselves forever. (Isa. 48:17; 1 John 2: 17) The new circuit assembly program will emphasize how we can gain greater happiness by giving in a spiritual way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> We will learn practical ways in which we can give of ourselves in the ministry. Some of the talks to be given by the traveling overseers are entitled: “Making Friends by Means of Unrighteous Riches,” “Respect Divine Provision of 'Gifts In Men,’ ” and “Experience the Many Facets of True Happiness.” Those desiring to be baptized at the assembly will want to speak to the presiding overseer so that he can arrange for elders to review baptismal questions with them. Serving Jehovah in a clean relationship will bring great happiness to the newly baptized ones.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">’Proper recognition of Jehovah’s authority also brings true happiness and security. All people need to know this. Hence, the public address at the circuit assembly will develop the theme “Unite With God’s Happy People.&quot; Be sure to Invite all those who have shown an Interest in the truth to come to this talk. They have not found genuine security and lasting happiness under human rule in this world, which Is lying in Satan’s power. (Eccl. 8:9) But what Joy they will find in being associated with Jehovah’s happy people!—Ps. 144:15b.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Despite worsening conditions in this system of things, those who experience the greater happiness in giving spiritually will never be disappointed by the happy God. (1 Tim. 1:11) The new circuit assembly program will demonstrate this to be true. Do not miss it!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is the greatest example of one who manifests genuine care for others. As the Universal Sovereign, he is sensitive to the needs of his human creation. (1 Pet. 5:7) Jesus encouraged his followers to manifest the traits of his Father, who makes the sun rise and the rain fall upon righteous and unrighteous people. (Matt. 5:45) You can imitate Jehovah by showing genuine concern for others —being prepared to share the Kingdom message with everyone you meet. By being thoroughly familiar with the brochures that will be used in the ministry during July, you will be in a good position to offer spiritual assistance to others. The following suggestions offer some ideas as to how you may prepare for the initial call and then follow up interest with timely return visits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> When offering the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">■ “Have you ever wondered why God permits humans to suffer if he really cares about them? (Allow for response.] This brochure not only provides the satisfying answer to this question but also shows that God has promised to undo all the damage man has brought upon himself and his earthly home.” Read paragraph 23 on page 27. Show the illustration below it, and read Psalm 145:16 from paragraph 22. Offer the brochure. If it is accepted, ask a question that can be answered on the next visit, such as: &quot;Would you like to know </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font7"> God will accomplish his purpose of bringing blessings to mankind and transforming the earth into a paradise?” Be sure to mention that our worldwide work Is supported by voluntary donations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> When returning to those with whom you placed the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” you might get another discussion started this way:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">■ “When I called last time, we considered that God does indeed care for us and that it is his purpose to undo all the damage man has brought upon himself and his earthly home.&quot; Open the brochure to the Illustration on pages 2-3 and say: “We ended our conversation with the question, How will God accomplish his purpose of bringing blessings to mankind and transforming the earth into a paradise? What do you think?&quot; Allow for response. Turn to page 17, and read paragraph 2 and Daniel 2:44. Thereafter, read paragraph 12 on page 18. Ask householder if he would like to consider with you part 9 of the brochure. If he would, study it with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">* Here is an approach that might be used in offering the brochure</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“When Someone You Love Dies.&quot; Show its cover and say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “Today </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">we are sharing this brochure </span><span class="font7">thaChas brought comfort and hope to millions of people who have lost loved ones In death. Have you ever wondered what hope there is for the dead? [Allow for response.] The Bible clearly states God’s promise of a resurrection. ” </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Read John 5:28,2</span><span class="font7">9. Open the brochure and comment on the points made in the last paragraph on pa</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ge 28 a</span><span class="font7">nd the first paragraph on p</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">age 3</span><span class="font7">1. Show the accompanying illustrations. Offer the brochure. You can prepare the way for a return visit by asking, “How can we be sure that eventually death will be completely eliminated?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Where you placed the brochure “When Someone You Love Dies,” you may want to use this presentation on the return visit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “When we spoke before, we discussed the wonderful hope of a resurrection. The brochure I left you explains why we can be sure that eventually death will be completely eliminated. Did you not find God’s promises comforting and reassuring?&quot; Allow for response. Then turn to page 31 In the brochure, and read the second and t</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">hird paragrap</span><span class="font7">hs, along with Revelation 21:1-4. Highlight the prospect we have of enjoying life without ever dying. Depending on the interest shown and the circumstances at the moment, you may offer a Bible study in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font7"> book or ask another question to open the way for the next return visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">• You might say the following when presenting the brochure “What Is the Purpose of Life—How Can You Find It?”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ “Many people have wondered what the purpose of life is. They’ve asked themselves: 'Why am I here? Where am I going? What does the future hold for me?' Where do you think we can find the answers? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible says. [Read Psalm 36:9.] Is It not reasonable to conclude that man’s Creator is in the best position to explain why we are here? [Allow for response.] This brochure shows the grand purpose that God has in store for us.” Turn to pages 20-1, read the caption, and comment on the Illustration; then offer the brochure. If accepted, ask: “How can we be sure it is still God’s purpose for humans to live forever in Paradise on earth?” Explain the donation arrangement. Set up a time to return.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup> If the brochure “What Is the Purpose of Life—How Can You Find It?”</span><span class="font7"> is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">placed, you could say something like this when you return:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">■ “On my previous visit, I really enjoyed discussing with you the Bible’s view that human life really does have a purpose.&quot; Show the illustration on page 31 and ask, “How can we be sure it is still God’s will that humans are to live forever in Paradise on earth?&quot; Read paragraph 3 on page 20. Discuss points under the subheading, “Still God's Purpose,&quot; on page 21. Turn to the back cover of the brochure, and read about the offer of a free home Bible study. Introduce the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font7"> book, and offer to demonstrate how we use it as an aid to study the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>8</sup> Our ministry should reflect the sincere Interest that we have in helping honesthearted ones to “come to an accurate knowledge of truth.&quot; (1 Tim. 2:4) Therefore, make time in your service schedule to call back on each person with whom you place a brochure. Your manifesting real concern for them may result In helping those who are sighing and groaning over the detestable things practiced In false religion to become identified for survival. (Ezek. 9: 4,6) You will also experience the Joy and satisfaction that come from knowing you are imitating Jehovah by genuinely caring for others.—Compare Phllippi-ans 2:20.</span></p></li></ul>

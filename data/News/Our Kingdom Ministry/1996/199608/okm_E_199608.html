<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">No Letup in Declaring the Good News</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The early Christians took their ministry very seriously. Luke reported: “Every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.” (Acts 5:42) Nothing, not even persecution, could hold them back! (Acts 8:4) They spoke to others about the truth every day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> What about us? Ask yourself: ‘Do I sense the urgency of the times? Am I inclined to continue declaring the good news without letup?'</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Modern-Day Examples of Preaching Without Letup: </span><span class="font10">One sister, a victim of polio, was confined to an iron lung. She was not able to go to the Kingdom Hall or attend an assembly. But she was intensely occupied with declaring the good news. During her 37-year confinement, she was able to help 17 people learn the truth! How did she do it? Although unable to go from door to door, she found a way each day to witness informally to those who came in contact with her.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">* Our brothers in Bosnia have had to cope with war and deprivation. Nevertheless, they regularly continue to preach to others. In Sarajevo the publishers have been averaging 20 hours each month talking to others about the good news, and they conduct an average of two Bible studies each. Despite their severe circumstances, they preach and teach without letup.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Young ones also manifest zeal for the ministry. A family of Witnesses in Rwanda were put in a room where soldiers prepared to kill them. The family asked permission to pray first. This was granted, and the young daughter, Deborah, prayed out loud: “Jehovah, this week Papa and I placed five magazines. How are we going to get back to these people to teach them the truth and help them get life?” Because of her strong faith and her love for the ministry, the entire family was spared.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Today, there is a need to watch for opportunities to witness to others and search out those “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (Acts 13:48) In accord with local circumstances, congregation elders make arrangements for group witnessing at convenient times, whether in the mornings, afternoons, or evenings. Articles in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> and parts on Service Meetings, circuit assemblies, and district conventions offer timely suggestions and encouragement to share in various avenues of Kingdom witnessing. Added to this, circuit and district overseers train publishers in street witnessing, show how to work business territory, and point out other ways to give a witness wherever people are to be found. All of this emphasizes no letup in declaring the good news!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Jesus’ apostles boldly declared: “We cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.” How did they persevere in spite of all obstacles? They asked Jehovah to help them, which he did, and “they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and were speaking the word of God with boldness.&quot; (Acts 4:20, 29, 31) Everyone may not be blessed with outstanding experiences in the ministry, but if we truly desire to declare the good news without letup and if we put forth the effort to do so even on a daily basis, Jehovah will help us.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Who Is Qualified to Preach?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When it comes to the ministry, have you ever felt like Moses? He said: “Excuse me, Jehovah, but I am not a fluent speaker, neither since yesterday nor since before that nor since your speaking to your servant.” (Ex. 4:10) If you feel that way, you may be inclined to hold back. Yet, Jesus “ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness.” (Acts 10:42) So how do we become qualified preachers of the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> It is not the extent of our secular education that qualifies us for the ministry. Paul said that “not many wise in a fleshly way were called” and that “the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.&quot; (1 Cor. 1:26; 3:19) Jesus selected his apostles from among the working class—at least four being fishermen by trade. The proud religious leaders viewed them with disdain as “men unlettered and ordinary.” Judged by worldly standards, the apostles were unqualified to preach. Yet, Peter’s masterful discourse delivered on the day of Pentecost moved 3,000 to be baptized!—Acts 2:14, 37-41; 4:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah Qualifies Us to Preach: </span><span class="font10">Paul declared: “Our being adequately qualified issqes from God.&quot; (2 Cor. 3:5) Jehovah, the Source of wisdom, has taught millions to preach Kingdom truth to others. (Isa. 54:13) The effectiveness and fruitfulness of this work can be seen in the 338,491 who were baptized last year as living “letters of recommendation.” (2 Cor. 3:1-3) We have every reason to preach with boldness and conviction about the things we have learned from Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> God’s organization has established an international training program for ministers. By means of the Scriptures and a great variety of Bible study aids, we are schooled and trained to become “fully competent, completely equipped” to preach. (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) Many have been impressed with the scholarship found in the Society’s publications. For example, a Swedish periodical stated: “Behind the faith being preached by Jehovah’s Witnesses there is an amazing high-class and internationally oriented Bible science.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> With the direction given in our five weekly meetings, our program for Bible reading and study, counseling in the Theocratic Ministry School, personal assistance by others who are experienced ministers, and above all, the backing of Jehovah’s holy spirit, we can be confident that Jehovah views us as fully qualified to preach. “Yes, as sent from God, under God’s view, in company with Christ, we are speaking.&quot;—2 Cor. 2:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If we take hill advantage of the theocratic training provided by God through his organization, we have no reason to hold back or feel intimidated. We can joyfully preach to others, assured that Jehovah will bless our efforts.—1 Cor. 3:6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">As foretold at Isaiah 54:2, 3, Jehovah’s pure worship continues to expand throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This includes various lands on the African continent and nearby islands. During the past ten years, restrictions on Kingdom activity have been lifted in such places as Angola, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, and Togo. In these and other lands where the field has been white for harvesting, Gilead missionaries, graduates of the Ministerial Training School, Bethel faml-ly members, and others have taken up assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">—Matt. 9:37,38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Obviously, the increase of true worshipers in Jehovah’s organization calls for the construction of hundreds of new Kingdom Halls. It has also been necessary to plan for Assembly Halls and new or expanded branch facilities. Financing these projects as well as keeping the Kingdom work moving forward not only in Africa but also in other parts of the world has drawn heavily on the contributions to the Society’s worldwide work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New Special Assembly Day Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “Be Persons Taught by Jehovah” is the theme for the new special assembly day program starting in September. (John 6:45) Divine teaching from Jehovah truly helps us to live satisfying Ilves. It develops within us a keen appreciation for our spiritual heritage. Our efforts to help others hear the good news make us useful members of society. This special assembly day will highlight the blessings that are enjoyed by persons taught by Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The program will contrast the benefits of divine teaching with the dangers of worldly learning. We will see more clearly how Jehovah provides the highest form of education—education based on his Word, the Bible. Emphasis will be placed on three areas of worship in which we experience delight in being taught by God. Additionally, youths will be encouraged to Imitate outstanding Bible examples such as David and Timothy and to build their lives around spiritual activities. Our </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font10"> A special effort will be made to follow up on all placements, with a view to starting home Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ An adequate supply of forms for use during the 1997 service year is being sent to each congregation. Please use these forms with good discretion. They should be used only for their intended purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ Each congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms (S(d)-18). The congregation secretary should meet with the literature servant early in August and set a date for taking inventory of the congregation’s stock of literature at the end of the month. An actual count must be made of all literature In stock, and the totals are to be entered on the Literature Inventory form. The total number of magazines on hand can be obtained from the magazine servant. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Please mail the original to the Society no later than September 6.</span><span class="font10"> Keep a carbon copy for your flies. The third copy may be used as a work sheet. The Inventory should be supervised by the secretary, and the complet-faith will be strengthened as the loyalty of older ones is also highlighted. Newly dedicated ones who qualify will be able to get baptized. Well In advance of the assembly day, they should inform the presiding overseer of that desire.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The main discourse of the special assembly day Is entitled “Taught by Jehovah to Do His Will.” It will stress reasons why all of us need to keep learning, to be stabilized in the faith, and to continue making advancement. We will be urged to imitate Jehovah by teaching others the truth that leads to everlasting life. Upbuilding experiences will be included to show how the publications of the Society have helped many to be taught by Jehovah. The positive accomplishments of Jehovah’s global teaching program will be highlighted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Make definite plans to attend. Encourage all interested ones to be present. Look forward to being taught many good things by our Grand Instructor.—Isa. 30:20. ed form should be checked by the presiding overseer. The secretary and the presiding overseer will sign the form.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ Congregations should begin requesting the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1997 Calendar of Jehovah's Witnesses</span><span class="font10"> with their September literature request. The calendars will be available In Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Ukrainian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ From August 28, 1996, to August 31, 1996, the Society will be taking an inventory of all literature on hand in Brooklyn. Because of this inventory, no congregation literature requests will be processed for shipment or for pickup during those days.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Proclaim the Kingdom Good News With Brochures</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What a joy it is to know the truth and to be among those who are zealously proclaiming the good news! People who are outside God’s organization desperately need to hear the Kingdom good news. The truth about the Kingdom is explained with simplicity in the brochures </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, “Look! I Am Making All Things New,&quot;</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Government Thai Will Bring Paradise.</span><span class="font10"> They vividly portray life on earth under God’s Kingdom, and they direct the reader to the Kingdom realities that are explained in God’s Word. Of course, placing a brochure with an interested person is only the start of our work. (1 Cor. 9:23) Let us promptly follow up all placements, with the objective of offering a study in the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font10"> How can we accomplish this during August?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> The brochure “Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!” may be offered tcith a very brief presentation. As you display its cover, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “I would like to show you something that contains a beautiful message.” Open the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life on Earth</span><span class="font10"> brochure, and read the first paragraph of the introduction. Then continue: “It also answers this question [turn to the heading above picture number 8): ‘Why does man die?’ You will find it interesting to study the pictures and read the scriptures that are in this brochure. If you want to do that, you may keep this copy.” If the brochure is accepted, then add: “This is a worldwide volunteer work that is supported by small donations. If you care to make a donation, I will be pleased to accept it.&quot;&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> What will you say when making a return visit on a placement of the “Life on Earth&quot; brochure? You could try this approach:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ Show picture number 49 in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life on Earth</span><span class="font10"> brochure and ask, “Isn’t this a beautiful picture? [Allow for response.] It is in the brochure that I left with you last visit. I would like to ask you the question on the next page.” Turn to picture number 50 and read the question: “ ‘Do you want to live forever in that beautiful paradise?’ [Allow for response.] If that is your wish, notice what it says you should do: ‘Then learn more about what God says.’ [Read John 17:3.] I would be happy to study the Bible with you free of charge. Would you like that?” Make a definite appointment to return.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> When offering the brochure “Look! I Am Making All Things</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New,&quot; you might start by displaying the entire cover picture and asking:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “What do you think it would take to make the whole earth look like this?” Allow for response. Describe some of the features of the picture, which are related on page 3. Then say: “Most people feel it is impossible to make a world like this. But it is not impossible for God to accomplish. [Share points in paragraph 43; then read Isaiah 9:6,7.] God has promised to bring about a new world in which people from all nations will enjoy a wonderful paradise. I’d like you to read this brochure. It will show how you and your family can enjoy a marvelous future of God’s making.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> On the return visit, you could use the “Look!” brochure to explain why there is a need to learn more about the Bible. Perhaps show the cover again and say: </span><span class="font10">■ “When I first showed you this picture, we agreed that we would love to live in such a wonderful world. To make this possible, there is something all of us need to do.” Open the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!&quot;</span><span class="font10"> brochure to paragraph 52; read the paragraph and the scripture at John 17:3. Relate the information to the illustration in paragraph 53 about a proper Bible education, and then explain that Jehovah’s Witnesses offer such instruction free of charge in the home. Offer to demonstrate our study method, using the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> When offering the brochure “The Government That Will Bring Paradise,&quot; you might try saying this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “I’ve heard many people say they would like to live under a government that can really solve the big problems we face today. [Mention local problems such as unemployment, rising crime, or drug abuse.] These things make us feel very insecure about the future for ourselves and our loved ones. Do you think there will ever be a government that will solve these problems? [Allow for response.] Perhaps you have prayed the Lord’s Prayer. If so, did you know that you are actually praying for a righteous government?&quot; Turn to page 3 in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font10"> brochure, and read the first two paragraphs. Offer the brochure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">’’If the brochure “The Government That Will Bring Paradise” was placed, you could begin the discussion on the return visit by saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “Previously we discussed the need for a righteous government that can solve man’s problems. The brochure that I left with you points to God’s Kingdom as our only hope. Some people wonder what that government could do to improve our lot in life. The Bible shows that Christ has already proved he will succeed where human leaders have failed.&quot; Open the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font10"> brochure to page 29, and read the last four paragraphs. Then say: “Is that not a wonderful future? Would you like to see it?&quot; Allow for response. Read John 17:3. Encourage learning more through a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> If you are using other brochures, you can prepare your own presentations, using those suggested above as models. When appropriate, explain briefly that interested people may make small donations to the worldwide Kingdom-preaching work. Prepare well and seek Jehovah’s blessing as you proclaim the Kingdom good news.</span></p>

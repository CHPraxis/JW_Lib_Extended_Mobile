<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Bless Jehovah “All Day Long”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Psalm 145:2 contains a promise that King David made to Jehovah: “All day long I will bless you, and I will praise your name to time indefinite, even forever.&quot; We too have reason to bless and praise our heavenly Father! But how can we imitate David’s example in exalting Jehovah’s sovereignty “all day long”?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Fill Our Heart* With Appreciation for Jehovah: </span><span class="font9">Regular study of God’s Word deepens our gratitude for what Jehovah has done, is doing, and will yet do for us. As we grow in appreciation for his marvelous acts, we will find ourselves bubbling over about his goodness. (Ps. 145:7) We will eagerly praise Jehovah on every appropriate occasion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Praise Jehovah in Daily Conversation: </span><span class="font9">When conversing with neighbors, schoolmates, workmates, and others we contact daily, we may find opportunities to share our hope with them. A neighbor may express concern about crime in the community; a schoolmate may be anxious about drug abuse or immorality; a workmate may state an opinion about some political issue. We can point to the principles and promises in God’s Word that show the proper course to take now and the eventual remedy for these problems. Such words spoken at the “right time” can be a blessing!—Prov. 15:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Speak About Jehovah Full-Time: </span><span class="font9">The person with deep appreciation for Jehovah </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">wants</span><span class="font9"> to share the good news with as many others as possible. (Ps. 40:8-10) In this regard we should ask ourselves, ‘Am I doing all that my circumstances will allow?’ Many have found that with some reasonable adjustments, they have been able to become regular pioneers. If present circumstances do not allow for that, can we enroll as auxiliary pioneers? Since the upcoming Memorial season is a time for expanded activity, the months of March and April would be a fine time to increase our service by auxiliary pioneering.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• Help New Ones to Join Us in Blessing Jehovah: </span><span class="font9">The celebration of the Memorial of Jesus' death always reminds us of reasons to be thankful to Jehovah and to praise His name. This is an especially good time to encourage our Bible students to join us in speaking publicly about Jehovah’s kingship. Urge them to reflect prayerfully on what is stated in paragraphs 7-9 on pages 173-5 in the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font9"> If they qualify, they have no reason to hold back just because they lack experience. Capable publishers are available to show them how the Kingdompreaching work is done. If new ones can muster up boldness to speak the good news, they can be confident that Jehovah will help them.—Acts 4:31; 1 Thess. 2:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">•We bring eternal benefits to ourselves as well as to others when we seek to bless Jehovah all day long.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Benefit From the Theocratic Ministry School for 1996—Part 3</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul wanted his brothers to pray in his behalf so that he might acquire the ability to speak the good news with boldness. (Eph. 6: 18-20) We desire to cultivate that same ability. To that end, we appreciate the help provided by the Theocratic Ministry School, in which qualified meeting attenders are encouraged to enroll.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> As students, we receive personalized counsel to help us improve our speaking and teaching abilities. (Prov. 9:9) We can also benefit from listening to the counsel other students receive, applying what we learn to ourselves. When preparing an assignment, we should study the source material carefully to make sure that our explanation of it is accurate. The main points and the scriptures that we use should fit in with the development of the overall theme. If the assignment involves another person, it should be rehearsed well in advance of being presented in the school. As we make progress, an effort should be made to speak extemporaneously, using notes instead of a manuscript.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> All who have assignments in the school should arrive early, give the school overseer their Speech Counsel slip, and sit near the front of the hall. Sisters should let the school overseer know in advance what their setting is and whether they will stand or sit for their part. Cooperating in these ways contributes to a smooth program and helps those caring for the platform to get everything ready beforehand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Preparing Assignment No. 2: </span><span class="font9">One purpose of the Bible reading is to help the student improve his ability to read. How can this best be achieved? Reading the material aloud over and over again is the best way to master it. To learn the meaning and proper pronunciation of any unfamiliar words, the student should look them up In a dictionary. This may also require becoming acquainted with the meaning of the pronunciation symbols used in the dictionary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font9"> renders aid in pronouncing proper names and uncommon words that are found in the Bible. It does this by breaking them down into syllables and providing accent marks. (See </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“AU Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,&quot;</span><span class="font9"> pages 325-6, paragraphs 27-8.) As a rule, the syllable preceding the accent mark receives the major stress. If the accented syllable ends in a vowel, the vowel is long in its pronunciation. If a syllable ends in a consonant, the vowel in that syllable is short. (Compare Sa’lu with Sal'lu.) To prepare for their Bible reading assignments, some brothers listen to the Society’s audiocassettes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Parents can assist their young children to prepare the reading assignment. This may include listening when the child is rehearsing and then giving him helpful suggestions for improvement. The allotted time allows for a brief introduction and an appropriate conclusion that makes application of key points. Thus the student develops his ability to speak extemporaneously.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’The psalmist prayerfully requested: “O Jehovah, may you open these lips of mine, that my own mouth may tell forth your praise.” (Ps. 51:15) May our participation in the Theocratic Ministry School help us to satisfy this same desire.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">■ Is it appropriate to contribute for transportation that is provided by others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some of us have circumstances that require us to depend on others for assistance in regularly attending the meetings and sharing in field service. Many brothers and sisters kindly go out of their way and lovingly use their time, vehicles. and other resources to provide transportation for us. Although they may have to get ready earlier than they would otherwise and they are delayed in returning home. they provide the transportation with a willing spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As in every other aspect of our Christian ministry, the principle found at Galatians' 6:5 applies: “Each one will carry his own load.&quot; Therefore, if someone regularly provides transportation for us, we should show our appreciation not only by our words but also, if we possibly can, by a reasonable contribution to help care for the expenses involved.—Matt. 7: 12; 1 Cor. 10:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Even if the person who is using his vehicle does not ask for financial assistance and does not appear to be in need of such, the sincere offer of a contribution is always appreciated. The driver may decline to accept anything; and, of course, that should be a decision for him to make. But it is proper for you to make the offer. If you are unable to contribute anything at the moment, you can keep it in mind; you may be able to offer something extra the next time you accept a ride.—Luke 6:38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is very loving for those who have vehicles to provide transportation for others who might otherwise be unable to attend meetings or share in the field ministry. (Prov. 3:27) At the same time, it is also loving for those who benefit from such kindness to express their thanks by contributing in accord with their circumstances.—Col. 3:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Look over the publication you plan to offer, and pick out some interesting talking points. Select something you feel will be of interest to people in your territory. Give thought to how you might adjust your presentation for different householders—a man, a woman, an older person, or a youth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Z,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Have you tried holding practice sessions? Get together with family members or other publishers to discuss what presentations might be effective, and then rehearse them aloud so that all will have them well in mind. Try to simulate actual situations and objections that could be encountered in the&quot; territory. Such practice will improve your fluency In speaking, increase your effectiveness in preaching. and build your confidence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> In addition to preparing and practicing your presentation, you should also ask yourself, ‘Is the clothing that I plan to wear suitable for the ministry? Do I have what I need in my book bag, including the literature that I plan to use? Is it in good condition? Do I have my </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book, tracts, house-to-house records, and a pencil?' Thoughtful planning in advance will contribute to a more productive day in service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup>0nce we have done the best that we can to prepare ourselves, we should pray for Jehovah’s spirit to help us to be successful.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “This means everlasting life,&quot; said Jesus in prayer to his Father, “their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God.&quot; (John 17:3) What a generous reward that is! By using the publication </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life,</span><span class="font9"> we can help others learn what they need to do to live forever. What can we say to arouse their interest and prompt them to want to read the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font9">book?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> You might use a presentation that features the Bible as a practical source of guidance, by saying: </span><span class="font9">■ “We are discussing with our neighbors where to find a practical source of guidance for coping with the problems of life. In the past many people first consulted the Bible. But now people’s attitudes have changed; many are skeptical about the Bible, viewing it simply as a book written by men. What is your opinion? [Allow for response.) There is a very good reason why it can be said that the Bible is practical for our day. [Read 2 Timothy 3:16,17.] Bible principles apply just as much now as they did when God inspired the writing of the Bible.&quot; Turn to page 16 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book, and briefly comment on the practical guidance found in Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. Read the quote found in paragraph 11 or the one in paragraph 13. Offer the book, and arrange to return to answer the question, How can we personally benefit from the knowledge contained in the Bible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Since prayer is a topic of interest for many people, you might like to discuss it by asking:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “With all the challenges we must face in modern-day life, do you feel that prayer can be of real help to us? [Wait for a response.] Many feel that they have drawn close to God by praying to him and that doing so has given them inner strength, which is just what the Bible promises. [Open the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font9">book to page 156, and read Phllippi-ans 4:6, 7.] Even so, a person may feel his prayers sometimes go unanswered. This chapter discusses ‘How You Can Draw Close to God.’ [Offer the book, and mention the donation arrangement for the worldwide work.] This chapter also explains how we can listen to God, since communication with him is not one-sided. We can discuss that when I come next time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* Would you like to try a direct approach to start a study? Here is one that may work for you:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “We are offering a free home Bible study course. Have you ever taken a Bible course before? [Allow for response.] Let me show you the study aid that we use.&quot; Display the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book, turn to page 3 so that the householder can see the table of contents, and ask, “Have you ever wondered what the Bible has to say about these subjects?” Turn to the chapter about which the most interest is shown, and read the subheadings. Explain that you would like to demonstrate briefly how we cover this information in our study course. Whether a study is started or not, leave the book if the person promises to read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Today multitudes of people are responding to the accurate knowledge of the true God. (Isa. 2:2-4) It is our privilege to help as many as possible to learn about Jehovah and be led to life. —1 Tim. 2:4.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul explained that it is ‘God’s will that all sorts of men should come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.’ (1 Tim. 2:4) How can we help others to take in that knowledge? One way is by making return visits on persons whose interest has been aroused by means of the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font9"> This publication presents Bible truth in clear, simple, well-chosen words. By studying it, people of all sorts can be led to life. What can we say that will encourage others to study it with us?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> For those who showed an interest in the Bible as a practical guide, you could return to offer a study, perhaps saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “When I was here before, we discussed why we can trust the Bible as a practical source of guidance. Because of its being inspired by God, the Bible is also a sure source of comfort and hope, even as one of Christ’s apostles stated. [Read Romans 15:4.] At the end of our last conversation, I raised the question, How can we personally benefit from the knowledge contained in the Bible?” Read paragraph 18 on page 11 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book. Point out that Jehovah's Witnesses are conducting some five million Bible studies worldwide, helping people everywhere to take in the knowledge that leads to everlasting life. Offer a brief demonstration of how a study is conducted, using the first five paragraphs in chapter L</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If prayer was the topic you initially discussed with someone, you might try this approach in an effort to start a study:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “I hope you enjoyed the information about prayer that we discussed from the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font9"> I promised to come back and consider with you how those who pray to God can, in turn, listen to him. Notice what is stated on page 158. [Read paragraph 18.] Thus, by personally studying the Bible, we are listening to what God has to say to us. Doing that draws us closer to him and helps us to deal with the day-to-day problems about which we pray. Itwouldbemy pleasure to study the Bible with you.” If the person is willing, begin with the first chapter of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If you used the direct approach to start a study, you might say this to follow up the initial discussion:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “I made a special effort to stop by again because I wanted to tell you more about our free Bible study program. I left with you a copy of this book, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, </span><span class="font9">which is the study aid that we use. Notice how it encourages us to consider God’s Word. [Read paragraph 23 on page 22.] If you would please get your copy of the book, perhaps we can continue studying where we left off the last time.” If a study was not started on the initial call, you might say: “Perhaps this would be a good time for me to demonstrate how we study the Bible.&quot; After considering a few paragraphs, arrange a definite time to return for the next study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Using the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book effectively will enable us to spread about accurate knowledge for the blessing of others. (Prov. 15:7) Such knowledge will bring delight to those whose hearts are right, and it will be a powerful incentive for them to live in harmony with Jehovah’s righteousness, leading eventually to everlasting life.</span></p></li></ul>

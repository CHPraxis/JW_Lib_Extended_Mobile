<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Imitate Their Faith</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul defined faith as “the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.” He added that “without faith It is Impossible to please [God] well.” (Heb. 11: 1, 6) Paul urged us to exercise faith, overflow with it, and pursue it.—2 Cor. 4:13; Col. 2:7; 2 Tim. 2:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> There are many outstanding examples of faith recounted in the Bible. In Hebrews chapter 11, Paul gives a long list of witnesses who demonstrated unbreakable faith. Included in this list is Abel, who was the first to be martyred for his faith. Noah is listed because by his faith he showed the godly fear that was needed to save his household. Abraham is commended for his faith and obedience. Moses is praised because by his faith he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible. The list of examples was so long that Paul said time would fall him If he went on to relate all of them. How thankful we are that we can strengthen our faith by reviewing their “holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion&quot;!—2 Pet. 3:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> In the first century, Jesus posed the question: “When the Son of man arrives, will he really find the faith on the earth?” (Luke 18:8) Well, then, do we have living examples of faith among us today? Do we see men and women, both young and old, manifesting unshakable faith in Jehovah as was true of God’s people in Bible times?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Modern-Day Examples of Faith: </span><span class="font9">Outstanding examples of faith are to be found all around us! The faith of overseers who are taking the lead among us Is worthy of Imitation. (Heb. 13:7) But these are not the only ones exemplary in faith. Associated with every congregation are loyal ones who have a long record of faithful service to Jehovah, often performed under very difficult circumstances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> We must admire our faithful sisters who, for years, have endured opposition from opposing husbands. Single parents have had to meet the challenge of raising children alone. There are older widows among us who are never missing from congregation activities even though they may have no family to help them. (Compare Luke 2:37.) We marvel at the faith of those who endure chronic health problems. Many continue to serve loyally even though they have limitations that prevent them from being assigned extra privileges of service. There are young Witnesses who have courageously exercised faith despite opposition In school. Our godly devotion grows stronger as we observe faithful pioneers who persevere year after year In the face of untold problems. Just like Paul, time would fall us if we tried to relate all the experiences In Kingdom service and the acts of faith performed by these brothers and sisters!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> These examples of faithful ones give us comfort and encouragement. (1 Thess. 3:7, 8) We do well to imitate their faith because “those acting in faithfulness are a pleasure to [Jehovah].&quot;—Prov. 12:22.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Them to Serve Again</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Recognizing a potential spiritual danger for his fellow Christians, the apostle Paul wrote: “It is already the hour for you to awake from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became believers.&quot; (Rom. 13:ll)Paul was concerned about his brothers who had become spiritually drowsy; he was anxious to revive them to renewed activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> It can truly be said that the night of this old world is well along and the dawn of the new world is just ahead. (Rom. 13:12) We have good reason to be concerned about our brothers who have ceased to associate with us as preachers of the good news. Last service year, In the United States alone, over 27,000 publishers were reactivated. How can we help other inactive ones to serve Jehovah once again?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> What Eldars Can Do: </span><span class="font9">Most who are inactive have not abandoned the truth; they have simply stopped preaching because of discouragement, personal problems, materialism, or other anxieties of life. (Luke 21:34-36) If possible, it is far better to help them before they become Inactive. The congregation secretary should alert the Congregation Book Study conductor when a publisher becomes Irregular in reporting service activity. Arrangements can be made for a shepherding visit. They should try to determine the underlying cause of the problem and how assistance can be given.—See September 15,1993, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> pages 20-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> How Others Can Help: </span><span class="font9">Most of us know someone who has become inactive. It might be a person who was quite close to us in the past. What can we do to help? Why not stop in for a brief visit. Tell him you miss his company. Be cheerful and positive. Express your concern without Implying he is spiritually sick. Relate upbuilding experiences or other good things being accomplished by the congregation. Enthusiastically tell him about the “Messengers of Godly Peace” District Convention, and encourage him to attend. Associating again with the congregation may help him more than anything else. Offer to accompany him to the meetings. Let the elders know of the response you received.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> When a person who has become inactive returns to the meetings, likely he will feel awkward when encountering others he has known In the past. Don’t ask, “Where have you been?” Instead, make him feel welcome. Involve him in conversation. Introduce him to those he does not know. Sit with him during the meeting, making sure he has a songbook and the material being studied. Encourage him to come back, and offer your assistance If there is a need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Having warm affection for those who have strayed, Jehovah and Jesus rejoice when such ones make a spiritual recovery. (Mal. 3:7; Matt. 18:12-14) We can experience that same joy if we succeed in helping others to serve Jehovah again.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Messengers of Godly Peace” District Convention and then for a 30-mlnute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-by-day review of the district convention program should be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on outstanding points. This well-prepared review will help the congregation remember key points for personal application and for use in the field. Comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</span></p>

From an early age, our children should be active with us in service. The training and experience they acquire will provide a strong basis for their faith and zeal in later years. It is important that they appreciate the need to take the ministry seriously and conduct themselves properly. Children must avoid rowdy conduct; service is not a time for playing. It Is best for them to work with adults. They should be helped to share in giving presentations according to their abilities. (See August 1,1988, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> page 15, paragraph 20.)

<p><span class="font9">■ How should the listing for Jehovah’s Witnesses appear in a local telephone directory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has been noted that there Is great variety in the way that listings for Jehovah’s Witnesses appear In telephone directories around the country. Some are rather confusing, and others do not provide sufficient information. If the congregation has a telephone in the Kingdom Hall, it is important to have an informative listing in the telephone book, making it possible for interested ones and our brothers to make contact with the local congregation.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>How to Make Disciples With the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Knowledge</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"> Book</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> A desirable goal for all Christians is to teach the truth to others and make disciples of those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (Acts 13:48; Matt. 28:19, 20) Jehovah’s organization has placed in our hands a wonderful tool with which to accomplish this—the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font10"> Its title keeps to the fore the great importance of home Bible studies, for everlasting life </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">depends </span><span class="font10">on </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">takfng in knowledge</span><span class="font10"> of Jehovah, the only true God, and of his Son, Jesus Christ.—John 17:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book is now the main publication of the Society for use in conducting home Bible studies. Using it, we can teach the truth with simplicity, clarity, and brevity. This will help reach the heart of those being taught. (Luke 24:32) Of course, there is a need for the conductor to use good teaching techniques. To that end, this insert has been prepared to set out suggestions and reminders regarding teaching methods that have proved effective. With discernment, and according to individual circumstances, you may be able to apply progressively some or all of what is here presented. Save this insert, and refer to it often. Various points in it may help you to be more effective in using the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book to make disciples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Conduct a Progressive Homo Bible Study: </span><span class="font10">Take a genuine personal interest in the student as a potential Christian disciple and spiritual brother or sister. Be warm, friendly, and enthusiastic. By being a good listener, you can get to know the other person—his background and situation in life—which will help you to discern how best to assist him spiritually. Be willing to give of yourself for the sake of the student. —1 Thess. 2:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Once a study is established, it is preferred that the chapters in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book be ? st</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">udie</span><span class="font10">d </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">in numerica</span><span class="font10">l order. This will allow the student to acquire a progressive understanding of the truth, since the book develops Bible subjects in the most logical sequence. Keep the study simple and interesting so that it is lively and moves along. (Rom. 12:ll)Dependingonthe circumstances and aptitude of the student, it may be possible for you to cover most chapters in one session of an hour or so, w</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ithout rush</span><span class="font10">ing through the study. Students will make better progress whenboth teacher and student keep their appointment for the study each week. Thus, with most persons, it may be possible to complete the book’s 19 chapters in a matter of about six months or so. —</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Introduce each session with brief remarks that stimulate interest in the material. You will observe that the title of each chapter is its theme, which needs to be emphasized. Each subheading isolates a main point, helping you to keep the chapter theme in focus. Be careful not to do too much talking. Instead, try to draw out the student’s expressions. Asking specific </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">leading</span><span class="font10"> questions of the student, based on what he already knows, will help him to reason and come to correct conclusions. (Matt. 17:24-26; Luke 10:25-37; see </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook,</span><span class="font10"> page 51, paragraph 10.) Stick closely to the printed information in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book. Introducing extra details could detract from or obscure the main points and protract the study. (John 16:12) If a question that does not pertain to the subject being studied is raised, in most cases you could address it at the end of the session. This will allow you to cover the week’s lesson without getting sidetracked. Explain to the student that eventually most of his personal questions will be answered through the course of the study. —See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook,</span><span class="font10"> page 94, paragraph 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If the student strongly holds to the Trinity, immortality of the soul, hellfire, or other such false doctrines, and what is presented in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book does not satisfy him, you could give him the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book or another publication that discusses the subject. Tell him that you will discuss the subject with him after he thinks about what he reads.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Beginning and ending the study with prayer for Jehovah’s guidance and blessing dignifies the occasion, puts one in a respectful frame of mind, and draws attention to Jehovah as the true Teacher. (John 6:45) If the student is still a tobacco user, you may eventually need to ask him to abstain during the study.—Acts 24:16; </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jas. 4:3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10">&quot;*’*7</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Teach Effectively With the Scriptures, Illustrations, and Review Questions: </span><span class="font10">No matter how many times he may have studied the material before, a skillful teacher will review each lesson with the particular student in mind.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">This helps to anticipate some of the student’s questions. To teach effectively, get a clear grasp of the main points in the chapter. Look up the scriptures to see how they apply to the material, and decide which ones should be read during the study. Gi</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ve tho</span><span class="font10">ught as to how you can teach using the illustrations and the review questions at the end of the chapter.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> By making effective use of the scriptures, you will help the student to appreciate that he is indeed studying the Bible. (Acts 17:11) Using the box “Put Your Bible to Good Use,” on page 14 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book, teach him how to locate scriptures. Show him how to identify the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">quoted </span><span class="font10">verses in the lesson. As time allows, look up and read </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">cited</span><span class="font10"> scriptures that are not quoted. Have the student comment on how they support or clarify what is stated in the paragraph. Emphasize key portions of the texts so that he comes to appreciate the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">reasons</span><span class="font10"> for the main points of the lesson. (Neh. 8:8) Generally, there is no need for the teacher to incorporate more texts into the discussion than those the book provides. Comment on the value of knowing the names and order of the Bible books. It may be helpful for the student to read pages 27-30 of the June 15,1991, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font10"> When appropriate, encourage use of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font10"> You could progressively demonstrate how to use its various features, such as the marginal references and the index of Bible words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> Study 34 in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook</span><span class="font10"> explains that illustrations stir up one’s thinking processes and make ft easierto grasp new thoughts. They couple intellectual appeal with emotional impact, so that the message is conveyed with a force that is not of. ten possible with simple statements of fact. (Matt. 13:34) The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> hook has numerous teaching illustrations that are simple yet powerful. For example, an illustration used in chapter 17 builds appreciation for how, in a spiritual sense, Jehovah furnishes food, clothing, and shelter through the Christian congregation. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book’s beautiful pictorial illustrations can be used effectively to stir the emotions. Under the subheading “The Joyous Resurrection,” on page 185, the impact of paragraph 18 will be strengthened by having the student look back at the picture on page 86. This may move him to think of the resurrection as a reality under God’s Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> Bible students need to make spiritual progress with each lesson. For this reason, do not fail to ask the review questions in the “Test Your Knowledge” box that appears at the end of each chapter. Listen for more than an intellectual explanation of what was studied. Several of these questions are designed to draw out a personal response from the heart. For example, see page 31, where the student is asked: “What qualities of Jehovah God especially appeal to you?” —2 Cor. 13:5. Aiy 4^.-&lt; y-</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Train Studants to Prepare for the Study: </span><span class="font10">A student who reads the lesson beforehand, marks the answers, and thinks of how to express them in his own words will make faster spiritual progress. By your example and encouragement, you can train him to prepare for the study. Show him your book, in which you have highlighted or underlined the key words and phrases. Explain how to find direct answers to the printed questions. Preparing a chapter together may be helpful to the student. Encourage him to express himself in his own words. Only then does it become clear whether he understands the material. If he reads his answer from the book, you can stimulate his thinking by asking him how he would explain the point to someone else in his own words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>13</sup> Encourage the student to look up unquoted scriptures as part of his weekly preparation, as there may not be time to read all of them during the study. Commend him for the effort he is putting into his lessons. (2 Pet. 1:5; see the August 15,1993, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> pages 13-14, for additional suggestions on what can be done by both teacher and student to increase learning on a Bible study.) In this way, the student is being trained to prepare for and make meaningful comments at congregation meetings. He will be learning how to develop good personal study habits that will equip him to continue making advancement in the truth after his personal Bible study in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book is completed. —1 Tim. 4:15; 1 Pet. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> Direct Students to Jehovah’s Organization: </span><span class="font10">It is a disciple maker’s responsibility to direct the student’s interest to Jehovah’s organization. The student will advance more quickly to spiritual maturity if he recognizes and appreciates the organization and realizes the need to become part of it. We want him to find pleasure in associating with God’s people and to look forward to being with us at the Kingdom Hall, where he can receive the spiritual and emotional support that the Christian congregation offers.—1 Tim. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>15</sup> The brochure </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Unitedly Doing God’s Will Worldwide</span><span class="font10"> has been produced to acquaint individuals with the only visible organization Jehovah is using today to accomplish his will. Once the study is established, why not give the student a copy? From the very start, keep inviting the student to the meetings. Explain how they are conducted. You could tell him the title of an upcoming public talk or show him the article that will be discussed at the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> Study. Perhaps you could take him to see the Kingdom Hall when a meeting is not in progress so as to alleviate any anxiety he may have about going to a new place for the first time. You may be able to offer transportation to the meetings. When he attends, make him feel welcome and comfortable. (Matt. 7:12) Introduce him to other Witnesses, including the elders. Hopefully, he will begin viewing the congregation as his spiritual family. (Matt. 12:49,50; Mark 10:29,30) You might set a goal for him, such as attending one meeting each week, and progressively raise the goal.—Heb. 10:24,25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>16</sup> As the home Bible study proceeds through the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book, emphasize the portions that highlight the need for regular association with the congregation at meetings. Note especially pages 52, 115, 137-9, 159, as well as chapter 17. Express your own deep feelings of appreciation for Jehovah’s organization. (Matt. 24:45-47) Speak positively about the local congregation and about what you learn at the meetings. (Ps. 84:10; 133:1-3) It would be good if the student could watch each of the Society’s videos, beginning with </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses —The Organization Behind the Name.</span><span class="font10"> For further ideas on how to direct interest to the organization, see the November 1,1984, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font10">pages 14-18, and the April 1993 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> insert.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> Encourage Students to Witness to Others: </span><span class="font10">Our goal in studying with people is to make disciples who witness for Jehovah. (Isa. 43:1012) That means the teacher should encourage the student to talk to others about what he is learning from the Bible. This can be done as simply as asking: “How would you explain this truth to your family?” or “What scripture would you use to prove this to a friend?” Emphasize key places in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book where witnessing is encouraged, such as pages 22, 93-5, 105-6, as well as chapter 18. When appropriate, the student may be given some tracts to use in informally witnessing to others. Suggest that he invite his family members to sit in on his study. Does he have friends who would also like to study? Ask him to refer you to those who are interested.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>18</sup> By attending the Theocratic Ministry School and the Service Meeting, the prospective disciple can receive additional training and stimulus that will help him become a publisher of the good news. When he expresses an interest in enrolling in the school or becoming an unbaptized publisher, the principles that are set out on pages 98 and 99 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font10"> book will apply. If an aspect of his life prevents him from qualifying, you can search in the Society’s publications for helpful material that bears on the matter and share it with him. For example, a student may be having difficulty overcoming an addiction to tobacco or other drugs. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book points out strong Scriptural reasons why Christians avoid such harmful habits, and on page 112 it outlines a way that has proved successful in helping others to break free. Pray with him about the matter, teaching him to build his dependence upon Jehovah for help.—Jas. 4:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>19</sup> The procedure to be followed for determining whether one qualifies to share in the public ministry is outlined in the January 15, 1996, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> page 16, paragraph 6. When the student qualifies, it would be helpful to conduct a practice session to prepare him for his first day in field service. In a positive manner, discuss the people’s reactions and objections that are common in your territory. Start him in the house-to-house work first if at all possible, and progressively train him in other features of the ministry. If you keep your presentation short and simple, it will be easy for him to imitate. Be upbuilding and encouraging, radiating joy in the work, so that he picks up your spirit and reflects it. (Acts 18:25) The goal of a new disciple should be to become a regular, zealous publisher of the good news. Perhaps you can help him to work up a practical schedule for service. In order for him to progress in his ability to witness to others, you may suggest that he read the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> issues of August 15,1984, pages 1525; July 15, 1988, pages 9-20; January 15, 1991, pages 15-20; and January 1,1994, pages 20-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>20</sup> Motivate Students Toward Dedication and Baptism: </span><span class="font10">It should be possible for an honesthearted student to learn enough through a study of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book to make a dedication to God and qualify for baptism. (Compare Acts 8:27-39; 16:25-34.) However, before a person will be motivated to make a dedication, he needs to develop devotion to Jehovah. (Ps. 73:25-28) Throughout the course of the study, look for opportunities to build appreciation for Jehovah’s qualities. Express your own deep feelings for God. Help the student think in terms of developing a warm, personal relationship with Jehovah. If he really comes to know and love God, then he will serve Him faithfully, for godly devotion has to do with how we feel about Jehovah as a person.—1 Tim. 4:7, 8; see </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook,</span><span class="font10"> page 76, paragraph 11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>21</sup> Strive to reach the student’s heart. (Ps. 119: 11; Acts 16:14; Rom. 10:10) He needs to see how the truth affects him personally and to decide what he should do with what he has learned. (Rom. 12:2) Does he really believe the truth that is presented to him week by week? (1 Thess. 2: 13) To that end, you can draw the student out by asking discerning </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">viewpoint</span><span class="font10"> questions, such as: How do you feel about this? How can you apply this in your life? By his comments you may discern where more help is needed to reach his heart. (Luke 8:15; see </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook, </span><span class="font10">page 52, paragraph 11.) The captions for the pictures on pages 172 and 174 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font10">book ask: “Have you made a dedication to God in prayer?” and “What prevents you from getting baptized?” These may effectively motivate the student to action.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>22</sup> The procedure to be followed when an unbaptized publisher desires to be baptized is outlined in the January 15, 1996, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font10">page 17, paragraph 9. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book was written with the objective of equipping the person to answer the “Questions for Those Desiring to Be Baptized, ” found in the appendix of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font10"> book, which the elders will review with him. If you have stressed the answers to the printed questions in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> bpok, the student should be well equipped for the question sessions conducted by the elders in preparation for his baptism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>23</sup> Help Those Who Complete the Home Bible Study: </span><span class="font10">It should be expected that by the time a person completes a study of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font10">book, his sincerity and depth of interest in serving God will have become apparent. (Matt. 13: 23) That is why the final subheading of the book asks, “What Will You Do?” The closing paragraphs appeal to the student to focus on the relationship he should have developed with God, the need to apply the knowledge he has learned, and the need to act quickly to demonstrate his love for Jehovah. There is no provision for studying additional publications with those who complete the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book. Kindly and clearly explain to a student who fails to respond to the knowledge of God what he has to do to progress spiritually. You might keep in touch periodically, leaving the way open for him to take the steps that lead to everlasting life. —Eccl. 12:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>24</sup> A new disciple who embraces the truth and gets baptized will have much more growing to do in his knowledge and understanding in order to become fully stabilized in the faith. (Col. 2: 6,7) Rather than continue his home Bible study after you complete the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book, you can make yourself available to provide any personal assistance he may need in order to mature spiritually. (Gal. 6:10; Heb. 6:1) For his part, he can round out his understanding by reading the Bible daily, personally studying </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and other publications of the ‘faithful slave,’ preparing for and attending the meetings, and discussing the truth with fellow believers. (Matt. 24:45-47; Ps. 1:2; Acts 2:41,42; Col. 1:9,10) His reading the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font10"> book and applying what it contains will play a vital role in his becoming theocratically organized to accomplish his ministry fully.—2 Tim. 2:2; 4:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> Develop the Art of Teaching: </span><span class="font10">We have been commissioned to “make disciples of people ..., teaching them.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) Since the art of teaching is inseparably linked to disciple making, we want to strive to improve as teachers. (1 Tim. 4:16; 2 Tim. 4:2) For additional suggestions on how to develop the art of teaching, you may wish to read: “Developing the Art of Teaching” and “Reaching the Heart of Your Listeners” in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook,</span><span class="font10"> studies 10 and 15; “Teacher, Teaching” in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Insight, </span><span class="font10">Volume 2; and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> articles “Building With Fire-Resistant Materials” and “When You Teach, Reach the Heart,” August 1, 1984; “Do You Effectively Reason From the Scriptures?,” March 1,1986; and “How to Find Joy in Disciple Making,” February 15,1996.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>26</sup> As you endeavor to make disciples, using the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book, always pray that Jehovah, the one “who makes it grow,” will bless your efforts in reaching human hearts with the Kingdom good news. (1 Cor. 3:5-7) May you experience the joy of teaching others to understand, to appreciate, and to act on the knowledge that leads to everlasting life!</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Friendly Conversations Can Reach the Heart</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Conversation can be defined as an “oral exchange of ideas.&quot; Starting friendly conversations on a topic that concerns others may capture their interest and can aid us in reaching their hearts with the Kingdom message. Experience has shown that it is far more effective to engage people in a friendly and relaxed conversation than to give them a sermon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> How to Start a Friendly Convor-aatlon: </span><span class="font9">Our being able to converse with others does not mean that we have to present some striking lineup of thoughts and scriptures. It simply Involves getting the other party to talk with us. For example, when we have a friendly conversation with our next-door neighbor, it is not rigid but relaxed. We are not thinking about our next words but are responding naturally to the ideas he expresses. Showing genuine interest in what he says may encourage him to continue conversing with us. The same should be true when witnessing to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Topics such as crime, the problems of youth, local issues, world conditions, or even the weather can be used to start friendly conversations. Subjects that directly affect the lives of people are very effective in arousing their interest. Once a conversation has been started, we can gently tum it toward the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Having a relaxed conversation does not mean that advance preparation is not necessary. It is. However, there is no need to formulate a rigid outline or to memorize a sermon, which would result in a conversation that is not flexible or adaptable to the circumstances at hand. (Compare 1 Corinthians 9:20-23.) An excellent way of preparing is to select one or two Scriptural themes, with a view to building conversations around them. Reviewing subjects found in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book will prove helpful for this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Essential Qualities for a Friendly Conversation: </span><span class="font9">When we converse with others, we should be warm and sincere. A smile and a cheerful appearance help to reflect these qualities. We have the best message in the world; it is most appealing to honesthearted ones. If they feel that our interest in them is motivated by a sincere desire to share some good news with them, then they may be moved to listen.—2 Cor. 2:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Engaging in conversation ought to be a pleasant experience. Therefore, we should be kind and tactful in presenting the Kingdom message. (Gal. 5:22; Col. 4:6) Strive to leave the other party with a favorable impression. This way, even if we are not successful initially in reaching his heart, he may be more receptive the next time a Witness converses with him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Starting a friendly conversation Is not the result of mastering a complex sermon. It is simply a matter of arousing Interest in a subject that is of concern to a person. Once we have prepared in advance, we will then be ready to engage people In friendly conversations. Let us endeavor to reach the hearts of those whom we meet by sharing with them the best news to be found, that of everlasting Kingdom blessings.—2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Spreading the Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is “the One teaching men knowledge.” (Ps. 94: 10) He uses us to spread lifesaving knowledge about him to those who are unaware of how to serve him acceptably. The book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life</span><span class="font9"> is a fine teaching instrument through which honesthearted ones can gain an accurate understanding of God from his written Word, the Bible. (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font9">book’s clear and logical development of the truth will help people to grasp what Jehovah is seeking to teach them. This month we want to engage people in conversations that will cause them to want to read the book. Here are some suggestions. Rather than attempt to memorize these, try to express the key thoughts in your own words and natural manner of conversing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Since most people have lost a loved one in death, you could work the resurrection hope into a conversation by first saying something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Most of us have lost a loved one in death. Have you wondered whether you will see such a one again? [Allow for response.] Death was not part of God’s original purpose for man. Jesus proved that our loved ones can be rescued from death. [Read John 11:11, 25, 44.] Even though this took place centuries ago, it demonstrates what God has promised to do for us. [Open the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book to the picture on page 85 and read the caption. Then show the picture on page 86 and comment on it.] If you would like to read more about this comforting hope of the resurrection, I’d be pleased to leave this.book with you.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> After the initial discussion about the resurrection hope, you could begin the next conversation with the same person in this way: </span><span class="font9">■ “You may recall my saying that death was not part of God’s original purpose for man. If that’s true, why do we grow old and die? Some turtles live over 100 years, and there are trees that have been alive for thousands of years. Why do humans live only 70 or 80 years? [Allow for response.] We die because the first human pair disobeyed God.” Read Romans 5: 12. Turn to page 53 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book and read the chapter title. Consider the first three paragraphs, pointing out the answers to the printed questions. Make an appointment to return later to discuss the rest of the chapter. Encourage the person to finish reading it in the meantime.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If you speak to a person who appears to be religious, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ &quot;There are literally hundreds of different religions today. They teach all kinds of conflicting beliefs. Some people say that all religions are good and it makes no difference what we believe. What is your opinion? [Allow for response.] Jesus taught the true religion and showed that other forms of worship are unacceptable to God. [Read Matthew 7:21-23.] If we want to please God, we must worship him in harmony with his will.&quot; Open the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book to chapter 5, read the title, and point out some of the subheadings. Explain that this information will help one learn how to please God. Offer to leave the book if there is a promise to read it, and mention that you do accept donations for our worldwide work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> People who are confused because there are so many religions might appreciate the answer to this question on your return visit: </span><span class="font9">■ “With so many different religions in existence today, how can we tell which is the right one? What would you look for? [Allow for response.] Jesus told us how to identify his true followers.” Read John 13:35. Consider paragraphs 18 and 19 in chapter 5 of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book. Point out that by using these Scriptural guidelines and the process of elimination, a person can recognize the true religion. Relate how Jehovah’s Witnesses are known the world over for their genuine love and high moral standards. Explain how a study of the Bible, using the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book, will clearly identity the form of worship that God approves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> If you meet a parent, this approach might be effective:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Every day, we hear reports about the unruly conduct of youths who seem to have no moral values whatsoever. Some adults want to blame the school system for not teaching children the difference between right and wrong. Who do you think should provide this training? [Allow for response.] Listen to what the Bible says on this question. [Read Ephesians 6:4.] That tells us that instilling moral values in children is the parents’ responsibility.” Open the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book to page 145, read paragraph 16, and comment on the pictures on page 147. Explain that the book is designed for the entire family to study. Using paragraphs 17 and 18 on page 146, offer to demonstrate how we conduct such a study with families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’ Zf </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">you started a study with a concerned parent on the initial call, you might continue it on the return visit by saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Today’s world places many temptations before our young ones. This makes it so difficult for them to become God-fearing as they grow up. Perhaps you remember that in our last discussion, we isolated two principles. As godly parents, we need to set fine examples for our children, and we should provide constant expressions of our love for them. There is another thing that the Bible says children need from their parents.” Read Proverbs 1:8. Turn to page 148 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book and continue the study, covering paragraphs 1923. Suggest that you return again to study with the entire family, starting with chapter 1.</span></p>

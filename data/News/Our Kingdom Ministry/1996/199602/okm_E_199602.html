<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font0">February 1996 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Proclaiming the Truth Daily in Imitation of Jesus</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jesus had a specific work to accomplish when he came to the earth. It was remarkably simple: ‘To bear witness to the truth.’ (John 18:37) He proclaimed the truth about his Father’s marvelous qualities and purposes. This work was like food to him; his whole life revolved around it. (John 4:34) Luke reported that Jesus kept “teaching </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">daily </span><span class="font8">in the temple.” (Luke 19:47) Jesus made full use of the time that was available. (John 9:4) Shortly before his death, he was able to declare to his Father: “I have glorified you on the earth, having finished the work you have given me to do.”—John 17:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> When our hearts are filled with appreciation for all that Jehovah has done, we likewise feel compelled to speak about him on a daily basis. We become just like Jesus’ disciples who boldly declared: “We cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.&quot;/Acts 4:20) Their speaking about Jehovah was continuous, for the record states that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“every day...</span><span class="font8"> they continued without letup.” (Acts 5:42) We should ask ourselves, ‘Am I an imitator of my Teacher, Jesus?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Preaching With Urgency: </span><span class="font8">Jesus foretold that when the Kingdom message has been declared in all the earth, “then the end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) This should impress on us the importance and urgency of our work. With the lives of literally millions at stake, we can find nothing more important or beneficial to do. Since this system of things is nearing its end, the time left to complete this work is reduced!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">‘Reports show that Jehovah is speeding up the ingathering of sheeplike ones. (Isa. 60:22) In many parts of the world, people are literally flocking to the truth, joyfully declaring, in effect: “We will go with you people, for we have heard that God is with you”!, (Zech. 8:23) More so than at any time in the past, Jesus’ words are true:(“The harvest is great, but the workers are few.... Beg the Master of the harvest to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0">Vol. 39, No. 2</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">send out workers into his harvest.” (Matt. 9:37,38) Does that not inspire us to be zealous like Jesus’ disciples who “were </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">continually</span><span class="font8"> in the temple blessing God”?—Luke 24:53.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Mak* th* Truth Known Dally: </span><span class="font8">Every day, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font8"> should be looking for ways to impart the truth to others. Opportunities are readily available. Could you take a few minutes to phone a friend or an acquaintance who you feel might be receptive? Or how about writing a letter to someone you were unable to find at home? Have you thought about offering a tract to the storekeeper when you do your shopping? Likely, you can think of many other opportunities you have each day to share your hope with others. If you make the effort and demonstrate a little boldness, Jehovah will help you.—1 Thess. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> So, as we begin each day’s activities, we should ask ourselves, ‘Will I take the initiative to share my hope with someone if an opportunity opens up today?’ Imitate the attitude of Jesus, who explained why he was sent to earth: “I </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font8"> declare the good news of the kingdom OfGod.” (Luke 4:43) If we want to be like our Teacher, we will do the same.—Luke 6:40.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Benefit From the Theocratic Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">School for 1996—Part 2</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Shortly after the inauguration of the Theocratic Ministry School in 1943, one of the Society’s branches reported: “This very fine arrangement succeeded in a short while in helping many brothers who had imagined they would never be public speakers to become very efficient on the platform and more effective in the field.” The school continues to provide excellent training, which all of us need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Bibi* Reading: </span><span class="font8">Those who are given speaking parts are not the only ones who benefit from the school. Actually, all of us have an assignment —the weekly Bible reading. The school schedule shows which chapters of the Bible are to be read each week. There are many Scriptural reminders that stress the Importance of reading the Bible daily. (Josh. 1:8; Ps. 1:2; Acts 17:11) Bible reading is essential to good spiritual health; it nourishes the mind and heart. If we read the Bible for at least five minutes a day, we will be able to keep up. At the end of the year, we will have read over 150 chapters of God’s Word. If we keep a Bible handy, we should be able to read some of It every day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Instruction Talk: </span><span class="font8">In Order to move the brothers to loyal, zealous service, the speaker who gives the Instruction talk needs to use good teaching methods, to convey understanding, and to build appreciation for Jehovah, his Word, and his organization. Elders and ministerial servants can accomplish this by preparing well, building their talk around the theme, speaking with conviction, and making the material live. (Heb. 4:12) It is important that the speaker keep within his allotted time. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture’</span><span class="font8"> book is replete with Bible texts and presents an array of exciting Scriptural material that can benefit us spiritually. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaim-ers</span><span class="font8"> book contains the modern-day history of Jehovah’s visible organization and relates events in the lives of real people who demonstrated faith, zeal, devotion, and love. There is much to be learned about our theocratic heritage and the way in which Jehovah has blessed his people in modem times.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Bibi* Highlight*: </span><span class="font8">Brothers given this assignment should select specific verses that can be applied In a practical way for the benefit of the congregation. This requires reading the chapters assigned, meditating on them, and researching selected verses to find points that will clarify the meaning of those scriptures. In the back of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index,</span><span class="font8"> there is the “Scripture Index,” which can be helpful In locating information about specific Bible verses. Brothers handling this part should exercise good judgment and avoid bringing in irrelevant material. They should not prepare more material than can reasonably be covered In six minutes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> All of us can benefit from the Theocratic Ministry School. It can help us Improve in our speaking and teaching ability. Taking full advantage of this provision will surely help us make our ‘advancement manifest to all persons.’ —1 Tim. 4:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">As noted on our </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">1996 Calendar, </span><span class="font8">the Lord’s Evening Meal will be celebrated this year on April 2. Encouraged by this grand occasion, let one and all share in zealous magazine distribution throughout April. What timely magazines we will be using! </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> for April 1 will focus on last year’s district convention public address, “Praise the King of Eternity!” The April 15 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> will follow the theme of last April’s special public talk, “False Religion’s End Is Near.” This year’s special talk on April 21, “Remaining Blameless Amid a Crooked Generation,&quot; should give added impetus. We will be featuring the April 22 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> on the topic “When Wars Wifi Be No More.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a follow-up to last April’s </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8"> campaign, this April should be an outstanding month for magazine distribution. Now is the time to make plans. Many will want to enroll as auxiliary pioneers. As needed, extra copies of the April magazines should be ordered. Plans can be made for Magazine Days, with everyone possible participating—morning, noon, and/or evening. Let all of us “become doers of the word.” As foretold regarding the Messiah at Psalm 69:9, may we also be able to say: “Sheer zeal for your house has eaten me up.”—Jas. 1:22; John 2:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How Can I Get a Listening Ear?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> In the city of Philippi, “a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple,... was </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">listening,</span><span class="font8"> and Jehovah opened her heart wide to pay attention to the things being spoken by Paul.” (Acts 16:14) What does this account teach us? Listening is what opens the door to a person’s learning the truth. Our success in sharing the Kingdom message depends primarily on the willingness of the householder to listen. Once we have a hearing ear, it is relatively easy to present our message. But getting someone to listen can be a challenge. What can we do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Before sharing in the service, we should give attention to our appearance and the equipment we will be using. Why? People are more inclined to listen to someone who presents himself with dignity. Are we dressed tastefully yet modestly? Although sloppiness may be popular in the world, we avoid such carelessness because we are ministers representing God’s Kingdom. Our clean and neat appearance adds favorable testimony to the Kingdom message we preach.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Bp Friendly and Raapactful: </span><span class="font8">In spite of today’s changing attitudes, many people still have regard for the Bible and wllj respond favorably to a respectful and friendly conversation about what the Bible contains. A warm, genuine smile can put the householder at ease and open the way for a pleasant discussion. Our sincerity and good manners should also be reflected in our speech and conduct, which includes our listening respectfully to the observations of the householder.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’ Our purpose is to share the Bible's hope with others. With this In mind, we should be sure that our conversation Is appealing, not adversarial or challenging. There Is no need to waste time arguing with a person who Is clearly opposed. (2 Tim. 2:23-25) We can select from a wide variety of encouraging and timely presentations provided for us In </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font8"> and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font8"> book. Of course, we need to prepare these well so that we can speak in a warm and convincing manner. —1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’After our visit, few householders are able to remember exactly what we said. However, virtually all of them can remember the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">manner</span><span class="font8"> in which it was spoken. We should never underestimate the power of goodness and kindness. Surely there are many sheeplike people In our territory who will give a listening ear to the truth Just as Lydia did in the first century. Giving careful attention to our appearance and manner of speech can encourage sincere ones to listen to God’s Word and favorably receive It. —Mark 4:20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Revelation—A Key to True Happiness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The words of the apostle John at Revelation 1:3 are good news to us because he tells us how to find happiness. He wrote: “Happy is he who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and who observe the things written In it.&quot; The book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!</span><span class="font8"> has aided many in finding much happiness. We have good reason to offer it to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> You might be able to get a conversation started ivith this question:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Do you think the Bible book of Revelation was meant to be understood, or was it always to remain a mystery? (Allow for response.) Many share your view. Note what the Bible says at Revelation 1:3. [Read.] So Revelation can be understood, and the knowledge that it contains can bring us happiness. How is this possible?” Review thoughts in paragraph 2 on page 6, and then say: “This publication presents a verse-by-verse discussion of the book of Revelation. It will be well worth your time to read it. I’d be pleased to leave this copy with you.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Since </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">many are concerned about providing for their material needs, this might create some interest:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ &quot;What do you think is our greatest need? [Allow for response.] There are many who are convinced that we need more material things.” Turn to page 73 and review the main points in the box entitled “Materialism Versus Wisdom.&quot; Continue by saying: “This shows that too much emphasis is being placed on physical things; we should be more concerned about our spiritual needs. True knowledge is what we really need. But knowledge about what?&quot; Read John 17:3, and explain how knowledge about God can lead to everlasting life. Offer to leave the book and to come back and show how it reveals marvelous information about God’s purpose to satisfy all the needs of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">’ Since many are concerned about distress in the world, you might try this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Everyone I talk to is concerned about the future. Some world leaders feel that we are on the verge of a new age of peace. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.] In spite of all man's efforts, violence and distress continue to increase worldwide. The Bible reveals the only lasting solution to these problems. (Read 2 Peter 3:13. Turn to the illustration on page 302, and explain how God’s heavenly Kingdom will bring lasting peace and security to this earth.] This publication will help you see how you can be part of this new society of people who will enjoy everlasting life under the rule of God’s Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> If you encounter someone who is busy and you must be brief, you might say this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Since you only have a moment, I would like to leave this tract [or magazine article] entitled (select appropriate tract or article]. I encourage you to read it. The next time I stop by, I’d like to know what you think of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> When offering our literature, give others the opportunity to show their appreciation by contributing toward the costs of the worldwide preaching work. Such giving will add to the happiness they will experience by discerning the meaning of the marvelous prophecies of Revelation.—Prov. 3:13.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Them Understand</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Peter acknowledged that some things stated In the Bible are “hard to understand.” (2 Pet. 3:16) Many have felt that way about the book of Revelation. However, its meaning has been made crystal clear In the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation—Its Grand Climax Ai Hand!</span><span class="font8"> How can we help Interested ones to make the best use of it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> If you discussed Revelation 1:3 on your initial visit, this thought might stir renewed interest:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Previously we discussed how an understanding of the book of Revelation can bring happiness. However, such happiness does not come automatically. At least two things are required of us: We must study the Bible, and we must practice what we learn.&quot; Read and comment on James 1:25. Turn to paragraph 9 on page 8, and point out how an understanding of the book of Revelation can help us learn how we can gain happiness in a paradise new world.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> If you discussed John 17:3 on your first call, you could stress the need for taking in more Bible knowledge by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “The last time I was here, we read at John 17:3 that taking in knowledge about God can lead to everlasting life. But would you want to live forever in the kind of world we live in today? [Allow for response.] Most would not. For this reason, we can rejoice when we hear what God has promised.&quot; Turn to paragraph 6 on page 303, read Revelation 21:4, and then describe what the world will be like when “the former things have passed away.&quot; Offer to return again for further discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'If you used the illustration on page 302 to show that God’s Kingdom will bring an end to distress, you could open the book to that page again and say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “We discussed the blessings depicted here that people will enjoy under the rule of God’s Kingdom. What do you think we must do if we want to live under that Kingdom? (Allow for response.] Some people in Bible times set an excellent example that we would do well to Imitate.&quot; Read Acts 17:11, stressing the need to ’examine the Scriptures daily.’ Explain that Jehovah’s Witnesses are helping sincere people In the community to study God’s Word and understand it better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">If you left the tract “Will This World Survive?” with a householder who was too busy to converse, you could use this approach:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “When I called recently, you were quite busy. I left a tract with you that raised a question about the world’s survival through these turbulent times. We read Revelation 21:4, which is quoted here in this book, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!</span><span class="font8"> [Read it from paragraph 6 on page 303.] This illustration [on page 302] gives you an idea of what it will be like when ‘God wipes away all tears from our eyes.’ This book offers convincing proof that this promise will be fulfilled in the very near future. If you would like to read it, this is your copy.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> If you find Interest, you will eventually want to direct attention to the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </span><span class="font8">and use It to start a study. You will surely find much joy in helping “the inexperienced ones understand.&quot;—Ps. 119:130.</span></p></li></ul>

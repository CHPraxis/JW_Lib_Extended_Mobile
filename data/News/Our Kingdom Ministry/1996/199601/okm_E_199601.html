<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Doers—Not Just Hearers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">'True Christians today take to heart the Bible admonition to be doers of the word, not just hearers. (Jas. 1:22) This sets them in sharp contrast with those who, although professing to be Christian, render mere lip service to God. (Isa. 29:13) Jesus clearly stated that only those </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">doing</span><span class="font9"> the will of God will be saved—Matt. 7:21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Worship without godly works is meaningless. (Jas. 2:26) So we should ask ourselves, ‘How do my works prove that my faith is genuine? What shows that I truly live in harmony with what I believe? How can I imitate Jesus more fully?’ Honest answers to these questions will help us to see what progress we have made or still need to make in doing God’s will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> As followers of Jesus, we must have the same primary goal in life as that expressed by the psalmist: “In God we will offer praise all day long, and to time indefinite your name we shall laud.” (Ps. 44:8) Christianity is a way of life that manifests itself every day and in everything we do. What satisfaction we find as we demonstrate in all our activities our heartfelt desire to praise Jehovah!—Phil. 1:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">* Giving Praia* to Jehovah Involve* Mor* Than Living an Upright Lit*: </span><span class="font9">If fine conduct were all that God required, we could simply concentrate on refining our personality. However, our worship also involves declaring abroad Jehovah’s excellencies and making public declaration to his name!—Heb. 13:15; 1 Pet. 2:9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> The public preaching of the good news is one of the most important works we perform. Jesus devoted himself to this work because he knew it meant everlasting life to those who would listen. (John 17:3) Today “the ministry of the word&quot; is no less important; it is the only means by which people can be saved. (Acts 6:4; Rom. 10:13) Realizing the far-reaching benefits, we can appreciate why Paul admonished us to “preach the word” and to “be at it urgently.” —2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> To what extent should praising Jehovah occupy our lives? The psalmist said that it was on his mind all day long. Do we not feel that way? Yes, and we will regard every contact with another person as a potential occasion to speak about Jehovah's name. We will look for appropriate opportunities to direct our conversation toward spiritual matters. We will also endeavor to share regularly in field service activities organized by the congregation. Those whose circumstances allow can give serious consideration to the pioneer service, for this helps us to put the preaching work foremost in our life every day. God’s Word assures us that by being persistent doers of God’s will, we will be happy.—Jas. 1:25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Benefit From the Theocratic Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">School for 1996—Part 1</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Have you read the instructions provided with the “Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 1996”? Did you take note of some changes? From January through April, Assignment No/3 will be based on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book, and from May to December, it will be based on the newly released </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book. Assignment No. 4 will be a talk about a different Bible character each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Studant Assignment*: </span><span class="font9">Assignment No. 3 is given to a sister. When it is based on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book, the setting should Involve door-to-door or informal witnessing. When based on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book, it should be presented as a return visit or a home Bible study. This should prove to be very helpful, since the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book will be used extensively for conducting home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> If the setting is a home Bible study, both sisters can be seated. Get right into the study by making brief introductory comments, and then ask the printed question. The role of the householder should be played realistically. The cited scriptures can be looked up and read as time allows. The sister should employ the art of teaching by drawing the householder out with questions and by reasoning on the scriptures used.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">* What should be done If there are more scriptdres cited in the assignment than can be discussed in five minutes? Select key texts that highlight the main points. If there are only a few scriptures, principal points in the lesson may be discussed more extensively. Occasionally, a paragraph or a sentence from the book may be read and then discussed with the householder.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> The box entitled “Test Your Knowledge,&quot; found at the end of each chapter of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book, may be reviewed briefly by the publisher whose assignment covers the final paragraph of the chapter. Information boxes that fall within the assigned paragraphs may also be discussed as time permits. If an information box occurs between two assignments, the sister handling the first assignment may consider it. Illustrations in the book may be commented on whenever they apply to the material under consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Assignment No. 4 should be very interesting and practical. Each week it will consider a real-life example—a Bible character. Carefully study what </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Insight,</span><span class="font9"> Volume 1, has to say about the assigned Bible character. Develop the talk around the theme, and select key Bible texts thaVwill help the audience to focus on the Bible character and his personality, including characteristics, traits, or inclinations that we want either to imitate orto reject. Scriptures not related directly to the Bible character may be Included if they highlight how Jehovah views certain good or bad traits or if they relate to the theme of the talk.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> If we take full advantage of the training provided in the school, we will be better able to “preach the word” in a way that demonstrates the fine “art of teaching.”—2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p>

First, read December 15, 1995, convention assignment letter. Then, after considering third paragraph of article, read opening and closing paragraphs of Recommended Lodging List from convention. Emphasize need for all to select accommodations from Recommended Lodging List, whether a person is attending a local convention or one outside the assigned area, as noted in paragraph 12 of the article. In the section “Your Cooperation Is Appreciated,” stress that the Bible principles of honesty, obedience, loving concern for others, and so forth, apply even if it appears that no one in the congregation will be using hotel rooms. Commend those cooperating with the Society’s rooming arrangement.</span></p>

Elder discusses with congregation the importance of each one properly filling out the Advance Medical Dlrective/Release card and carrying it at all times and the need for children to have the Identity Card always with them. As the title of the card suggests, it provides </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">advance </span><span class="font9">notice of what is wanted (or not wanted) as to medical care. Why is this done each year? A current card is more persuasive than one that might be considered to be out-of-date or no longer a reflection of one’s convictions. The document speaks for you if you are unable to speak for yourself. Cards will be given out tonight. They should be filled out carefully at home, but they are not to be signed. As has been done for the last two years, signing and witnessing will be done at the Congregation Book Study locations, under the supervision of the book study conductors. Those who sign as witnesses should actually see the cardholder sign the document. This will be done following the book study during the week of January 15. (See page 2 of January 1994 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> for details on procedure. See also letter of October 15,1991.) All baptized publishers may fill out Advance Medical Directive/ Release card. Unbaptized publishers, by adapting language from this card to their own circumstances and convictions, may wish to write out their own directive. Parents can help their unbaptized children fill out the Identity Card. Briefly mention the provision made in the Question Box of the December 1995 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> for health-care power of attorney (proxy) forms to be filled out by any baptized publisher who desires to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font9">“Be Doers—Not Just Hearers.” Questions and answers.

Many have to cope with severe cold, heavy snow, or rain during the winter months. A group of three or four publishers discuss how they are able to maintain a good share in the ministry in spite of bad weather. Many congregations work rural territories during summer months, concentrate on city territory during the winter, and arrange meetings for service in the territory to cut down on excessive travel. Some save apartment buildings for bad days. Keep car groups small to avoid excessive waiting. Break up house-to-house work with some return visits. Wear suitable clothing to keep warm and dry. Use the telephone or do letter writing when it is not wise to go outdoors. Discuss any other ideas that you have found to be practical in your area.</span></p>

Explain why the book of Revelation was long viewed as a mystery beyond our understanding. Review paragraphs 6 to 9 on page 8, showing why this book is needed. Encourage publishers to have these thoughts in mind so that they will have a basis for talking points at the door. Refer to “The Framework of the Book of Revelation” on pages 98-9, and show how this can be used to give an overall view of the book of Revelation. Call attention to the striking illustrations inside the front and back covers and how they might be used to start a conversation. Remind all to pick up copies for use in service this weekend.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1996 “Messengers of Godly Peace” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Genuine expressions of gratitude for the spiritually rejuvenating program were heard from many of the 1,452,460 who attended the 1995 &quot;Joyful Praisers” District Conventions in the United States branch territory. Our hearts were filled with joy at seeing 15,801 praisers of Jehovah symbolize their dedicationby water baptism. We rejoiced to receive the two new publications, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge Thai Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font10"> Our having enjoyed such a stimulatingpro-gram last year should truly motivate us to make every effort to attend the program being arranged for the 1996 “Messengers of Godly Peace&quot; District Conventions. Surely all of us should invite our Bible students and help them to be there with us. These conventions will prove to be a real source of encouragement and strength as we continue joyfully serving Jehovah in these last days.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Be sure to make your convention arrangements well in advance so that you can be there to enjoy all three days of the delightful spiritual program, from the opening song to the closing prayer. Lovingly include in your plans those who may need assistance, especially newly interested ones, so that they too can be present at every session. It would be very helpful to consider the information in this insert with any Bible students who may plan to attend. (Gal. 6:6,10) The program starts with music at 9:30 a.m. on Friday and ends at approximately 4:30 p.m. The Saturday program begins at 9:30 a.m. and closes with song and prayer at approximately 4:30 p.m. The morning session on Sunday begins at 9:30, and the day's program concludes at approximately 4:00 in the afternoon. The following information will assist you with your preliminary preparations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Instruction* for Obtaining Rooming Accommodation*: </span><span class="font10">After the Service Meeting for the week of January 1, congregations should post on the information board the 1996 Recommended Lodging List for the district convention to which the congregation is assigned. This list gives all the hotels presently cooperating with the Society’s rooming arrangements. Your cooperation with these arrangements will assist the convention organization in its efforts to provide sufficient rooming accommodations for everyone at reasonable prices.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> What You Should Do: </span><span class="font10">After—NOT before— your congregation posts the 1996 Recommended Lodging List containing the addresses, phone numbers, and agreed-upon rates of the hotels, you are free to phone the hotel of your choice from the list and make reservations, specifying the number of beds needed. Identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower convention will qualify you for the rates listed, which in most cases are greatly reduced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> One night’s DEPOSIT IS REQUIRED to hold the room. Your deposit should be sent directly to the hotel AS soon AS you make reservations. To make certain that your reservation is honored, be sure to ask for a confirmation number. If your deposit is not received by the hotel within ten days, your reservations can be canceled at any time, hotels are not OBLIGATED TO HOLD ROOMS WITHOUT A DEPOSIT. If you must cancel your reservation, you should immediately notify the hotel, making the room available for other delegates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If the hotel you call first is filled, call your next selection from the list, and so on. Often everyone calls the hotels closest to the convention facility being used; therefore, you may find it beneficial to try some hotels farther away. These also have quality rooms at lower rates. The convention Rooming Department will continue Jto provide the congregations with revised lists, deleting hotels that have been filled and listing additional hotels until everyone has a room. Thus, if all the hotels on the list are filled, please notify your congregation’s secretary</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>To Obtain a Room</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">■ Phone the hotel of your choice </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">after </span><span class="font10">the 1996 Recommended Lodging List is posted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ Identify yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ Be prepared to send one night’s deposit </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">immediately</span><span class="font10"> after reservation is made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ If all hotels or dormitories are filled, please wait patiently for the next list. and wait patiently for the next list, and you will be able to obtain a room. The congregation secretary should call the convention Rooming Department, using the telephone number on the Recommended Lodging List, and advise them that the hotels say they are full.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, JANUARY 1996</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Dormitories: </span><span class="font10">A few conventions use school dormitories in addition to hotels in order to accommodate everyone. Usually, congregations will receive information on these a month or so after receiving the first hotel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow the Instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Special Needs: </span><span class="font10">This provision is only for exemplary publishers, including their well-behaved children, who are approved by the Congregation Service Committee. Arrangements to care for persons with special needs should be made by the congregation where they attend meetings, not shiftingthis obligation to the convention organization. Elders and others who are aware of the individual circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often requires that publishers consider the needs of those in full-time service, the elderly, the infirm, and perhaps others. Publishers may extend help by taking such ones with them or caring for their needs in other practical ways.—Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Of course, the Rooming Department will endeavor to provide suitable rooming accommodations for publishers with special needs if they cannot be assisted by those in the congregation. These publishers may discuss their situation with the congregation secretary. The secretary should speak with the rest of the Congregation Service Committee to see if it is possible for the congregation to assist these individuals in caring for their own rooming accommodations. If the congregation is unable to render the needed assistance, the secretary may give such persons a copy of the Special Needs Room Request form. Only those with special needs should fill out this form. It is to be filled out by the person making the request. It should be returned to the secretary, who will check it for completeness, for accuracy, and for verification of the circumstances that qualify the person for such consideration. The circumstances are to be explained IN DETAIL by the secretary in the space provided on the form. All of this should be done well ahead of the convention. After verification by the service committee, the secretary will then forward the form to the Rooming Headquarters address. The individual making the request will be notified directly about the accommodations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> Those with special needs should NOT go to the convention and request a room when they arrive, since the Rooming Department must have the verification of the Congregation Service Committee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> Private-home accommodations are set aside for those who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who can afford hotel rooms but who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money. Furthermore, it is not proper for those making such requests to presume upon the hospitality of brothers by expecting to be accommodated for additional days before or after the convention. These rooms are provided for the convention period ONLY. Those receiving such accommodations should make sure that they and their children act respectfully toward the home of their host and not rummage through or damage the host’s possessions or enter private areas of the home. If householders experience any difficulties along this line, these should immediately be brought to the attention of the rooming overseer at the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Delegates Attending From Outside the Assigned Area: </span><span class="font10">The location assigned for you to attend is the one nearest your congregation. Arrangements for having adequate seating, literature, rooming accommodations, and so forth, are based on the premise that the majority of publishers will attend the convention to which their congregation is assigned. However, if for good reason you will be attending a convention other than the one to which you are assigned and need accommodations, parking tickets, and so forth, the congregation secretary can give you the address for that convention headquarters from the list on the back of the Special Needs Room Request form. Then you can request in writing a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">this year’s </span><span class="font10">Recommended Lodging List or any other information you need for that location. Be sure to enclose a stamped, selfaddressed envelope. Upon receipt of this list, you should use it to make your reservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Your Cooperation Is Appreciated: </span><span class="font10">The success of this rooming arrangement depends on the cooperation of all those involved. (Compare Hebrews 13:17.) Most brothers and sisters cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement and USE ONLY THE HOTELS ON THE RECOMMENDED LODGING LIST FOR THE CURRENT YEAR. Sadly, though, some are not cooperating, causing major difficulties in negotiating with the hotels. Some hotel personnel say they do not have to work with the convention because they will get our business anyway. Watchtower Convention contracted with the hotels on the list, stating that our convention delegates will be using them. It is a guarantee that they will get the business if they provide special rates for us. Most publishers are taking to heart the clear direc-</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Ways You Can Cooperate</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">■ Do not call hotels in the convention city and ask them if they are on the current list or have special Watchtower rates for the convention. Also, please do not use the same hotel year after year without first checking to see that it is definitely on the current list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ Do not accept a higher rate for a hotel room than what is quoted on the current list, including Thursday and Sunday nights.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ Please do not make reservations at a hotel you do not intend to use or at more than one hotel, with the idea of checking them out, selecting the best, and canceling the others. (Matt. 5:37) This is unfair, as it prevents the hotels from getting business they could have had, and it deprives other publishers of the use of those rooms, which are often vitally needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ Do not reserve rooms for yourself or others without giving names and immediately sending the deposit for each room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ Do not put more people in the room than the law and the management allow, which is normally no more than four or five persons, including children. Remember, you are paying a rate based on the number of persons you AGREED would be in the room.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>14</sup> One brother informed the Society that the rooming arrangement really “pays off.” He stayed at a hotel for “a mere $38.00 per night.” An individual checked out just before him and paid $82.00 per night. The brother went on to say: “What a savings for all of us! How could we ever afford $82.00 per night plus gas, food, and other expenses? I don’t think many of the brothers realize the ‘regular rates’—I know we didn’t until today. Thank you.” Another wrote: “After I attended this year’s district convention, it hit me. All my life I’ve attended the assemblies and conventions and have (sorry to say) taken for granted the love, hospitality, and care that is shown to Jehovah’s people. Every year without fail we receive a Recommended Lodging List containing hotels that offer significantly lower rates than normal and that we should stay in while attending the convention. I can only imagine the time, money, and effort spent working out'all the details of prices, rates, and so forth, and really it doesn’t have to be done! It could be left up to each Witness to find his own room whatever the price, but it is not! All of this really impresses on me how much love and concern our Father, Jehovah, has for his servants and how he has set up an organization on earth to care for the needs of his sheep, spiritually and physically. So I want to thank you personally for all your hard work and love.” We trust that this year everyone will observe the guidelines for obtaining hotel accommodations noted in the box above.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>15</sup> Some have used Recommended Lodging Locations lists from previous years, and the hotel that they chose was no longer on the current list. Others receive letters from hotels they previously stayed at that are no longer on the list. So we ask that you use the current year’s list. Some are booking rooms at hotels not on the list or are paying rates higher than those listed, saying that they did not mention anything about their association with the Watchtower convention. They reserved their room, using their personal or corporate name. Of course, the hotel personnel involved easily observe that these individuals are Jehovah’s Witnesses by the dates they are booking and by their appearance and actions while staying at the hotel. Sad to say, some of our more affluent brothers are the ones violating the Society’s arrangement, feeling that they can afford to pay higher rates and not use the recommended hotels. However, this does not take into consideration the needs of the entire brotherhood. First Timothy 6:17-19 reminds us: “Give orders to those who are rich in the present system of things not to be high-minded, and to rest their hope, not on uncertain riches, but on God, who furnishes us all things richly for our enjoyment; to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be liberal, ready to share, safely treasuring up for themselves a fine foundation for the future, in order that they may get a firm hold on the real life.”&gt;Iust as we would care for the fatherless boy and the widow, we should at all times consider the needs of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font10">our brothers and sisters, not just ourselves.—Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>16</sup> On the other hand, IF YOU EXPERIENCE A PROBLEM WITH A hotel, please do not hesitate to bring it to the attention of the Rooming Department overseer at the convention so that he can assist you in resolving the matter right away.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>17</sup> The convention organization is working hard to make suitable accommodations available and save our brothers as much expense as possible. It is therefore in the best interests of all to cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement. The listing gives a choice of good-quality accommodations at hotels that cooperate. With this arrangement our aim is to help all convention delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible so that they can fully enjoy the fine spiritual program at the convention. Your loyal support of this provision from Jehovah through the faithful and discreet slave is greatly appreciated.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Note to Body of Elders: </span><span class="font10">Please do not read the Society’s December 15, 1995, convention assignment letter and the first and last paragraphs of the Recommended Lodging List for your congregation until the Service Meeting for the week of January 1. After that meeting, post the letter and the list on the information board. Elders are NOT to change their Service Meeting to an earlier night for this week unless the circuit overseer is visiting the congregation. NO ONE, INCLUDING THE ELDERS, SHOULD MAKE HOTEL RESERVATIONS BEFORE this service meeting. To the extent possible, the congregation secretary should handle convention-related material and announcements on future Service Meetings unless otherwise specified or if he is unable to do so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">■ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to celebrate the Memorial this year on Tuesday. April 2, after sundown. Although it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial celebration, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. The Memorial should not start so late that newly interested people find it inconvenient to attend. Further, the schedule should not be so tight that there is no time before or after the celebration to greet visitors, make arrangements for continued spiritual assistance for some, or enjoy a general Interchange of encouragement. After thoroughly considering all factors, the elders should decide what arrangements will best help those who attend the Memorial to benefit fully from the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ The special public talk for the 1996 Memorial season will be given on Sunday, April 21. The subject of the talk will be “Remaining Blameless Amid a Crooked Generation.” An outline will be provided. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer, a circuit assembly, or a special assembly day that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before April 21.</span></p>

So even on Sundays, contacting people from house to house has become a problem.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’When people are not at home, it obviously means that they are somewhere else. Since our goal is to talk to people, why not speak to those we do meet—on the street, in the marketplace, or in the workplace. It was Paul's custom to approach “those who happened to be on hand,” to give them a witness. (Acts 1717) This proved to be a productive form of witnessing then, and it is a productive form of witnessing in our day.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> When we go from house to house, we usually see people walking by’casually or perhaps waiting for someone. On a nice day, they may be sitting on a park </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">bench</span><span class="font9"> or working on or washing their car. A neighborly smile and a friendly greeting may be all we need to start a conversation. If they live nearby, we could even mention that we likely just missed them at their home and now we are glad that we have this chance to speak with them. By taking the i</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">nitiative</span><span class="font9"> to show a'ujtle more boldness, many have enjoyed rewarding experiences.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Boldness Gats Result^: </span><span class="font9">Onr brother related that he approaches people who are standing, waiting for a bus, walking along leisurely, or sitting in their car. With a warm smile and a cheerful voice, he takes the approach of a friendly neighbor who just wants to visit. In this way not only has he placed much literature but he has also started several Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Another brother and his wife were calling from door to door when they encountered a woman walking along carrying a large bag of groceries. They struck up a conversation, commending her for her diligence in looking after the needs of her family. “But who,” they asked, “can supply the needs of mankind?&quot; That sparked the woman's interest. A brief conversation led to an invitation to her home, where a Bible study was started.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> So the nextrtime you are witnessing from door to door, whether on Sunday or on another day of the week, and you find that people are not at home, why not muster up a little more boldness and speak to people you do meet—on the street or elsewhere? (1 Thess. 2:2) You may have a more productive ministry, and you will experience greater joy in your service.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Preach With Insight</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> To have insight requires that we understand something about the people to whom we preach. Why? Because our success in reaching people’s hearts depends on our ability to present the Kingdom message in a manner that appeals to them. During the month of January, we will be offering a variety of Bible study books that the congregation may still have on hand. Otherwise, publishers will use the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?</span><span class="font9"> The following suggestions may be helpful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> If you choose to offer the book “True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?” you could refer to the illustration on page</span><span class="font9"> 4 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">and say: </span><span class="font9">■ “This illustration is an artist's conception of what the Bible teaches about God's purpose for the earth. What do you think it would require for you and your family to live in a paradise earth? [Allow for response.] The Bible shows that true peace and security will soon be a reality earth wide and that Paradise will be restored. [Read Psalm 37:10,11.] This book can show you what you need to do to benefit from what God will do. I’d like to leave this copy with you.&quot; If there is a favorable response, you may briefly explain the donation arrangement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> WTien </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">you are using the book “Making Your Family Life Happy,” you might say something like this: </span><span class="font9">■ “Would you agree that the modem family faces challenges that were unknown to previous generations? [Allow for response.] Why, in your opinion, is this happening? [Acknowledge response. Turn to and read 2 Timothy 3:1-3.] The phrases ‘disobedient to parents' and ‘having no natural affection’ accurately describe many in our day. However, the same God who predicted these problems has also given us sound guidance on how to draw a family closer together.&quot; Read the paragraph from “The Publishers” on page 2. Offer the book without charge, and then mention the donation arrangement.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">’ Another approach that might be used with the book “True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?” begins with this question:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Many people today believe that God is not really Interested in us humans on the earth and that he is riot going to do anything about the problems that exist here. Is that how you feel? [Allow for response.] Let me read to you what this Bible study aid has to say about God’s intent toward man and the earth. [Read paragraph 1 and the first sentence of paragraph 2 onpage43.]rassureyou, there is a sound reason for God's toleration of the problems that exist on the earth. If you would like to learn what it is, please read this book, which is entitled </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?”</span><span class="font9"> If the householder promises to read the book, leave it and mention the donation arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If you tcould like to make a brief presentation using the book “Worldwide Security Under the ‘Prince of Peace,’ ” you could open the book to page</span><span class="font9"> 4 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">and ask:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “What is to become of planet Earth? Many wonder about this. Do you think it will ever become a paradise?&quot; Acknowledge householder’s response, and then read the opening remarks on page 2. Offer to leave the book, and explain the donation arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Good insight will enable us to discern the needs and interests of the people we meet. Proverbs 16:23 assures us of this, saying: “The heart of the wise one causes his mouth to show insight, and to his lips it adds persuasiveness.&quot;</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Return to Save Some</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> It is God’s will “that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) What can we do to help? Make return visits with the objective of teaching the truth. What wi 11 you say? The following suggestions may help you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> When </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">calling on someone who accepted the book “True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?” you might refer again to the illustration on page</span><span class="font9"> 4 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">and ask the householder: </span><span class="font9">■ “After further examining the book I left with you and thinking on God’s promise of a paradise earth, how do you feel about these marvelous promises God has made for mankind?” After acknowledging the householder’s response and commenting briefly on it, you may call attention to chapters 2 and 3 and suggest considering why man's efforts toward peace and security, including those of a religious nature, have failed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you left the householder wondering what the reason is for God’s toleration of wickedness, on your return you might resume the discussion by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “I enjoyed our conversation when we first met, and I wanted to return to see how you felt about the reason Tor God’s putting up with the unrest and violence that exist in the world today. [Allow for response. Turn to and read paragraph 25 on page 54 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace</span><span class="font9"> book, including the quotation from 2 Peter 3:8,9.] Notice that the next chapter in the book asks, ‘What Has God Been Doing?’ Perhaps we can discuss the answer to that question on my next visit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">* You might follow up the placement of the book “Making Your Family Life Happy” with this approach: </span><span class="font9">■ “When I first visited with you, I was impressed by your concern for your family. Living as we do in the last days of a wicked system of things, it is vital for families to keep preparing for the future. To that end, the book that I left wlthyou, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Making Your Family Life Happy,</span><span class="font9"> strongly recommends the having of regular Bible discussions in the home. [Read paragraph 10 on pages 185-6.] If I may, I’d like to take just a few minutes to demonstrate how people in some 200 lands discuss the Bible at home as family groups.&quot; As time allows, use the material under the subheading on page 71 to demonstrate the study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>4</sup> Tom </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">could follow up the placement of the “Worldwide Security” book by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “I wanted to come back to show you more about God’s purpose for this earth.” Turn to the Illustration on pages 172-3, read Revelation 21:3,4, and then briefly explain how God’s Kingdom will fulfill this promise. Offer a free home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Remember that the goal in making return visits is to start Bible studies. The new book, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life,</span><span class="font9"> is especially designed for conducting studies. When we follow up on the placement of older books and actually start a study, it would be good to direct attention to this new book. We will find much joy as those who study learn to call upon Jehovah for salvation. —Acts 2:21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Offering Ourselves Willingly</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">family study occasionally? A pioneer or a publisher may need a companion in the ministry. Why not offer to work together in the service? These are some of the ways in which we can voluntarily work what is good toward those related to us in the faith.—Gal. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’Brothers &lt;;an show their willingness to be used in Jehovah’s organization by striving to measure up to the qualifications for elders and ministerial servants. (1 Tim. 3:2-10,12,13; Titus 1:5-9) As we continue to grow in number, there is a need for qualified brothers who are willing to take the lead in preaching and teaching and in shepherding the congregations. —1 Tim. 3:1.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Perhaps some of us can make ourselves available for Jehovah’s service to a greater extent by enrolling as auxiliary pioneers from time to time. Then again, with a few reasonable adjustments in our schedule, we might be able to do so continuously or even take up the regular pioneer service. Are our circumstances such that we could move to an area where there is a greater need for help? Could we make ourselves available to serve at Bethel and thus directly contribute toward the progress of the worldwide work? Much is also being done in the construction of Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls, and branch facilities around the world, where willingness to work is very much in demand. Those who have offered themselves for these fine works are greatly appreciated, and they have been richly blessed!—Luke 6:38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> These are thrilling times. Jehovah, by means of his spirit, is accomplishing a marvelous work on earth with his willing people! Whenever Jehovah, through his organization, extends an invitation to share in Increased Kingdom activity, we do well to ask ourselves, 'Am I still offering myself willingly?’ Then we should prayerfully examine our heart and circumstances. Our godly devotion will prompt us to do all we can in sacred service, thus making Jehovah's heart very glad!—Zeph. 3:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Jesus foretold that in the last days, the preaching work would reach into ‘all the inhabited earth and all the nations’! (Matt. 24:14) During the 1996 service year, we continued to receive reports of marvelous increases and new peaks of publishers from lands around the globe. Many new congregations have been formed. This rapid growth : has made it necessary to construct hundreds of new Kingdom , KN Halls and Assembly Halls as well as to expand a number of branch facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">MMI</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The August 1996 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> reported on extensive construction work taking place in Africa. Similar activity is under way throughout Latin America. For the 1996 service year, Mexico reports an astounding peak of 470,098 publishers and an average of 600,751 Bible studies, requiring the formation of466 new congregations! The expansion of their branch facilities is scheduled for completion toward the end of 1999. Similar growth in many other countries allows for no letup in various types of theocratic construction projects.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Construction costs are high everywhere, and our brothers in many lands have little to contribute materially. However, in their great zeal for Jehovah’s service, they certainly are growing spiritually and increasing in great numbers. Proverbs 28:27 assures us that &quot;he that is giving to the one of little means will have no want.” Our willingness to help cover these con-struction costs results in an ‘‘equalizing’’ of material things. ■ enabling all to experience the happiness that comes with giv- . ing and the joy that comes with ■■G seeing the increase that Jehovah gives!—2 Cor. 8:14,15; Acts 20:35. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">N</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The Theocratic Ministry School has been instrumental In the training of millions of Jehovah’s Witnesses as ministers of the good news. Many of us remember how apprehensive and inadequate we felt when we first enrolled in this school, and now we gratefully acknowledge its role in our spiritual development as speakers and teachers of God’s Word. (Compare Acts 4:13.) Have you enrolled in this remarkable school?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Who may enroll? Page 73 of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry</span><span class="font10"> answers: “All who are actively associated with the congregation may enroll, including people newly attending the meetings, as long as they are not leading a life that is out of line with Christian principles.” We Invite all who qualify —men, women, and children—to approach the school overseer and ask to be enrolled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> School Program for 1997: </span><span class="font10">The Theocratic Ministry School program for 1997 covers a wide variety of Bible teachings and characters, as well as the history of the organization. In addition to developing our speaking and teaching abilities, we learn from the many spiritual gems that are found in its curriculum each week. (Prov. 9:9) If we prepare for the school, which includes doing the weekly Bible reading, and are in regular attendance, we can derive great spiritual benefit from the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> For 1997 most of the Bible readings for Assignment No. 2 are shorter tHan in past years. When preparing for this assignment, the student should time his reading carefully and then determine how much of the five minutes allotted for his part can be used for the introduction and the conclusion. This will allow the student to utilize his time fully and to develop both his reading ability and the art of speaking extemporaneously. —ITim. 4:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Informal witnessing has been added as a possible setting for presentations in Assignment No. 3, which are based on the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book. Hence, a sister may choose either a return visit, a home Bible study, or informal witnessing as the setting for this assignment. Of course, the main emphasis should continue to be placed on effective teaching and not on the setting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Whether you have the privilege of giving the Instruction talk, Bible highlights, or a student assignment, you can show your appreciation for the Theocratic Ministry School by preparing and rehearsing your part well, by presenting it with conviction and enthusiasm, by not going overtime, by listening to and applying the counsel of the school overseer, and by always endeavoring to fulfill your assignment faithfully. Thus your enrollment in the school will prove to be a blessing both for you and for all who are in attendance.</span></p></li></ul>

We must make return visits with the goal of starting a Bible study. He</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">lp is assured if we put </span><span class="font10">forth such effort. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Here are some suggested presentations:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you meet an older person, you might try this approach:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “May I ask: When you were younger, how did people in the community treat one another? [Allow for response.] Things are a lot different now, aren’t they? What do you think is the reason for the change? [Allow for response.] We are actually seeing the fulfillment of a prophecy in the Bible. [Read 2 Timothy 3:1-5.] Besides accurately describing the world as it is today, the Bible promises a better world in the near future. For that reason we are encouraging everyone to read the Bible. Did you notice how clear the language is In this Bible, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font10"> that I was reading from?” Explain that it is written in modern English, making the Bible more understandable. Show the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible-God’s Word or Man’s?,</span><span class="font10"> and point out chapter 10, which explains another prophecy that we have seen fulfilled. Offer the Bible and the book. If offer is accepted, mention the donation arrangement that supports our worldwide work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> When you call back on an older person with whom you placed the Bible and the book, you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “When we last talked, we agreed that in many ways modern society has changed for the worse compared with what life was like just a few years ago. However, I came back to show you that the Bible sets out prospects for a much better world in the future. [Read Revelation 21:3, 4.] Knowing that this is God’s Word should encourage us to look into what else the Bible has to say.” Open the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Word</span><span class="font10"> book to chapter 14, and read paragraphs 3-4. Offer a free home Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> If you engage a younger person in conversation, you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “I would like to ask you a question: As a young person, do you feel that you have reason to be optimistic about what lies ahead? How does the future look to you? [Allow for response.] Fortunately, there is real reason to be optimistic about the future. [Read Psalm 37:10, 11.] Since people have varying views of the Bible and Its contents, we have published this book, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?</span><span class="font10"> Notice the reasons it gives for reading the Bible. (Read paragraphs 16-17 on pages 10-11.] Once we are convinced that what the Bible says is true, we come to have a sure hope for the future. If you wish to read this book, I will be happy to leave a copy with you.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> When you return to seeayoun-ger person who accepted the “God’s Word” book, you might begin by stating:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “I appreciated hearing how concerned you are about the future. Recall that I showed you a Bible text promisihg us a happy and secure future. Here is another one. [Read Revelation 21:3, 4.] The book I left with you gives convincing proof that the Bible is God’s Word, not man’s. That fact has some profound implications. Notice what they are. [Read paragraphs 1-2 on pages 184-5.] If you would like, I will be pleased to study the Bible with you free of charge.” If a study is accepted, ask if the individual has a copy of the Bible. If he does not, offer the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font10"> Give the person an opportunity to make a donation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup> A person who does not know where to turn for guidance to cope ivith life’s problems might respond to this approach:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “We live at a time when almost everyone Is faced with serious problems. Many turn to all sorts of counselors for guidance. Some look to psychics for help. Where do you think we can find sound counsel that will really work for us? [Allow for response.] The Bible states an important fact that all of us need to appreciate.” Read Jeremiah 10:23. Open </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?</span><span class="font10"> to page 187, and read paragraph 9. “This book will help you to appreciate how, under God’s Kingdom, all our problems will be eliminated. Would you like to read it?” If accepted, explain our donation arrangement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

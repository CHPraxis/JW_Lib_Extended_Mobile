<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Render Sacred Service Day and Night</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> An extraordinary pr</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ivile</span><span class="font9">ge has been extended to us. It is that of b</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">eing wit</span><span class="font9">nesses of Jehovah. We are part of the worldwide organization of evangelizers being used by Jehovah to accomplish the greatest Kingdomproclamation work ever undertaken! (Mark 13:10) In view of the urgency of our times, are </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">we sharing</span><span class="font9"> in this work to the fullest extent possible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> We do not know how many will eventuallyTespOhil to our preaching. Jehovah assures us that it will be “a great crowd,&quot; all of whom are identified by their “rendering him sacred service day and night.” (Rev. 7:9,15) The over five miUien Witnesses who are already busy in God’s service are not-staply interested llsteners, nor are they Just meeting attenders. They are workers who proclaim the good news worldwide!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Every day, there are opportunities to praise Jehovah, either in field service or informally. Think of the grand witness that could be given if each one of us took the initiative to share the truth with Just one p</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">erson e</span><span class="font9">ach day. Our appreciation for Jehovah should move us to speak about him with enthusiasm. —Ps. 92:1,2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">' Help Others to Render Sacred Service: </span><span class="font9">Jehovah continues to bless us with Increase. (Hag. 2:7) During the past service year in the Unite</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">d States. </span><span class="font9">an average of 568.4</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">80 home Bible s</span><span class="font9">tudies were conducted each month. Our goal in studying with these people is to help them b</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ecome</span><span class="font9"> Jesus' di</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">sciples</span><span class="font9">. (Matt. 28:19,20) Many of them have already made fine progress by regularly attending the meeUngs. They have started speaking to their acquaintances “about the magnificent things of God” that they have learned. (Acts 2: 11) Canthey now be invited to participate in the public ministry?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> During April we should make a special effort to invite new ones who qualify, to Join us in the field service. Has your student, expressed-a </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">desire.</span><span class="font9">tn do this? If so, does he meettheScriptural requirements? (See </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font9"> book, pages 97-9.) When the student desires to share in the field service, discuss his prospects with the presiding overseer, who will arrange for two elders to examine the matter. Ifthe student qualifies to be accepted’ as an unbaptized publisher, invite </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font9"> to joirnyou in the field. Service overseers and book study conductors should especially be aware of assisting those who might qualify to begin publishing in April.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">• Parents might consider whether their children qualify to become unbaptized publishers. (Ps. 148:12, 13) If your child desires to express himself in Kingdom service and he is of good conduct, you may approach'one of the eiders on the service committee to discuss the situation. After </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">meeting</span><span class="font9"> with you and the child, two eld</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ers will d</span><span class="font9">e-termjpe whether he &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">counted as a publisher. There is special cause for rejoicing when children join us in praising God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> Only Jehovah is worthy of our sacred service. (Luke 4:8) May each of us use our wonderful privilege to praise him “very much.”—Ps. 109:30; 113:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Times Have Changed</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The Bible tells us that “the scene of this world Is changing.&quot; (1 Cor. 7:31) How true that is today! Even in our lifetime, we have seen drastic changes in the thinking and conduct of people on every level of human society. If we are to be successful in reaching them with the Kingdom message, our approach must keep up with the changing times. We want to present the good news in such a way that it interests people and reaches their hearts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Years ago, in many lands the witness work was different because, for the most part, people lived more tranquil lives, and they felt secure. Religion held a sacred place in their lives. The Bible was highly regarded. In those days witnessing often involved refuting arguments on doctrinal issues. Today, people’s lives are in turmoil. Religion is ridiculed. Few have faith in the Bible. And for many, the theory of evolution has destroyed faith in God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> One traveling overseer observed: “Now. it seems, there are so many problems and difficulties in people’s lives that we have to teach them how to live.” The immediate concerns of people naturally revolve around themselves, their families, and their anxieties. These are the things that they talk about most when they get together. We need to keep that in mind in our witnessing work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> God’s Kingdom Is the Only Sure Hope for the Future: </span><span class="font9">Most people have little confidence in human government. They feel that there is no prospect for seeing a better world in their lifetime. False religion has failed to give them any basis for hope. That is why the greatest need of mankind is to hear the good news about God’s Kingdom. Show how it will ultimately provide the solutions to all of the problems confronting mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> The Bible Is the Only Reliable Source of Guidance: </span><span class="font9">Today's masses have been misguided by leaders who rely upon human wisdom and worldly philosophies. People have yet to realize that “it does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.&quot; (Jer. 10:23) The most valuable lesson they can learn is that they must ‘trust in Jehovah with all their heart and not lean upon their own understanding.' (Prov. 3:5) While the times have changed, the Bible has not. Hence, in our ministry we should always feature God’s Word, teaching others to appreciate its inspired, divine guidance. (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) To fulfill that purpose, we must keep the importance of the Bible before the people by referring to it in our presentations, using it to answer their questions, and advocating the need to study it and apply its practical wisdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’ Even with today’s changing times, our objectives in the ministry remain the same. We are to preach the good news of the Kingdom, build confidence in God’s Word, and help others see the need to study the Bible with us. What we say must be relevant to the current needs of those to whom we witness. By doing this, we may become sharers of the good news with others and thus gain the most persons.—1 Cor. 9:19,23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Song 144</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font9">Local announcements. Some describe Jehovah’s Witnesses as a “sect&quot; or “cult,” misleading others about our activities and objectives. Using the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book, page 202, briefly explain how to refute this charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font9">Giving Even Coverage to Our Territory. Talk by service overseer. Scattered or distant areas may rarely be worked. Some may purposely avoid working in localities where people are affluent or strongly religious.-Business territories may be neglected. Some publishers may regularly request territories they personally prefer rather than those currently needing coverage. Encourage all to cooperate with efforts to cover unworked territories. The summer months usually provide a good opportunity to work distant rural areas; perhaps car groups can be organized. Make sure the territory is thoroughly covered, including not-at-homes, before it is returned. Offer other practical suggestions showing how all can assist in giving the best coverage to your territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font9">Offer </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> During May. Feature individual copies. In territory that is covered frequently, offer any appropriate brochure. Keep a record of all placements, with the goal of establishing a magazine route. Where there is sustained interest, subscriptions may be offered. Emphasize the far-reaching benefits of magazine distribution as one of the most effective means of getting the Kingdom message to the public. Make sure we have a supply when we go in service; offer them at every opportunity. Personal arrangements for a weekly Magazine Day are a good way to increase placements. Store-to-store work and street witnessing with magazines are also productive. Follow up interest with return visits that are designed to start studies, using the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book. Have one or two brief demonstrations offering the current issues, perhaps using presentations found in the September 1995 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> page 3, paragraphs 3-5; read paragraph 6.

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Be “Zealous for Fine</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Last spring an unprecedented witness was given when millions of copies of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> No. 34 were distributed worldwide. Congregation publishers and pioneers alike zealously shared in this stimulating work. Were you among them? If you were, no doubt you thoroughly enjoyedhaving a part in that remarkable campaign. Now you may be wondering, What ‘fine</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> work’ is in store for us this year?—Titus 2:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> During April and early May, we will have the pleasure of distributing a s</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">pecial edit</span><span class="font10">ion of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">ma</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">gazine</span><span class="font10">, the April 22, 1996, issue, featuring “When Wars Will Be No More.” Since this subject will appeal to a great many householders, we will endeavor to give the magazine the widest possible distribution. In view of the importance of the information it contains, this issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> should be featured during April and into May, until supplies are exha</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">usted.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Goal—Participation by All Publishers: </span><span class="font10">It would truly be encouraging if every publisher in this country could have a share in the preaching work during April. With the Memorial of Christ’s death fresh in mind, we will surely want to show our appreciation for God’s goodness by offering a direct “sacrifice of praise” '^imtlieJeldininistry^-Heb. 13:15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> A diligent effort should be made to discern the • needs of every member of the congregation so that all can have a zealous share in the ministry during April. (Rom. 15:1) Book study conductors should be fully aware of the circumstances of those'in their groups and offer practical help when necessary. Does anyone need transportation? Who can provide it? Are some timid or self-conscious? Can more experienced publishers work </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">along w</span><span class="font10">ith them? What about shut-ins or those who are ill? Could they engage in telephone witnessing, in letter writing, or in some other productive activity?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Some who liavfe become inactive have been receiving regular spiritual encouragement, and they may be motivated to engage in the preaching work once again. The campaign with the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> will provide them with an excellent opportunity to become reactivated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Train Young Ones to Take Part: </span><span class="font10">Many children of Jehovah’s Witnesses have accompanied their parents from house to house for years, although they are not yet serving as unbaptized pu</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">blishe</span><span class="font10">rs. Is now the time for them to get started? Are they moved from the heart and ready to have a meaningful share in the house-to-house work? Family heads-should use time during the family Bible study tojhelp their qualified children prepare a presentation tailored to each one’s age and abilffy? Older ones can choose a thought-provoking question With which to arouse the</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Works” During April!</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">interest of the householder and thef{point out th/au'-swer in the magazine. Younger children can give an effective witness in just a few words. For exanjple, they can encourage the householder to “read a special magazine that is being offered worldwide tills month.&quot; As part of your family’s preparation, be sure to include suggestions for overcoming common objections. You will find a number of good ideas in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font10">book. At mealtimes and on other appropriate occasions, encourage family members to relate the experiences they have had in field service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Qualified Bible Students Take Up the Work Jesus Did: </span><span class="font10">Jesus did not confine his teaching to giving instruction on doctrinal matters. He accompanied his students in the ministry and taught them how to preach. (Luke 8:1; 10:1-11) What is the situation today? More than half a million Bible studies are being conducted in the United States. No doubt, with appropriate encouragement many of these students could take the next step in their training and qualify to serve as unbaptized publishers in April. ~ <sub>t</sub> .. ,<sub>A</sub>..j ■&gt;/-</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> If you are conducting a Bible study, consider these questions: Is the student making progress, consistent with his age and ability? Has he begufTto share his faith Informally with others? Is he putting on “the new personality”? (Col. 3:10) Does he meet the quaUficg-tions for unbaptized publishers, outlined on pages 97 through 99 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font10"> book? If you believe Tie is qualified, why not discuss the matter with him? Some students need little more than a direct invitation to share in the work. Of course, if the student is willing, it will first be necessary for the presiding overseer to arrange in the usual way for a discussion with two of the elders. On the other hand, something may ^holding the student back. Perhaps one of the elders</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> '<sup>l</sup>' could accompany you on the Bible study and draw the student out as to his feelings toward the truth. After listening to what the student has to say, the elder may be able to provide practical suggestions, along with Scriptural help.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> ‘Buy Out the Time’ to Auxiliary Pioneer: </span><span class="font10">Each year during the Memorial season, gratitude for the ransom moves thousands to ‘buy out’ the time to be auxiliary pioneers. (E</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ph. 5:15-17</span><span class="font10">) Although some sacrifice</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">s are</span><span class="font10"> needed, the rewards are great.

Adults who work full-time use evenings and weekends to full advantage in this same activity. Thus, entire families have been known to auxiliary pioneer together! In some congregations most of the elders and minister</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ial serv</span><span class="font10">ants and their wives have enrolled as auxiDary pioneers.

<p><span class="font10">that a large percentage of the congregation serve as auxiliary pioneers in April.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> Whether you are able to auxiliary pioneer or not, look for ways to increase your service in the field during April. Set a personal goal for yourself, one that will require some effort to reach but that is attainable.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> Those who conduct meetings for field service should see to it that there is plenty of territory on hand. Territory that has n</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ot been worked recent</span><span class="font10">ly should be covered first.

<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> How Many Magazines Will You Place?</span><span class="font10">That question is for each individual to answer. In determining how many magazines you can place during the campaign, consider the type.of territory you will be working, your age, your health, the time you can devote to the work, and other factors. Note, however, the reminder that was given in the January 1,1994, issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower^&quot;</span><span class="font10">As a suggestion, publishers may have a goal bfsayTO magazines per month, depending, on their circumstances; pioneers might strive for 90.”) Would a similar goal be realistic in your case?</span></p></li>

Then you can briefly share a specific/ point in the magazine. Street witnessing with magazines should also be properly organized within the congregation’s territory. The most effective way to engage in street work is to take the initiativa.and approach passersby, rather than to wait for them to approach you. Since you will be in </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">the public ey</span><span class="font10">e, you should be conscious of having a dignified appearance. There may be other places in your territory that could be worked during the campaign, such as airports, hospitals, parking lots, parks, and rest homes. The body of elders should determine what appropriate arrangements can be made for witnessing in these areas of your congregation’s territory.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">■ Where practical, as daylight hours increase, elders should make arrangements for the congregation to spend more time in evening witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 1996 in Chinese, English. French. Greek. Italian. Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these. Based on the size of each congregation, cards will be shipped in lots of 25. If additional badge cards are needed by the congregation, these should be requested on a Literature Request Form (S-14). It Is necessary to request plastic badge card holders for any in the congregation who desire them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ An adjustment is being made in the procedure for replacing Pioneer Service Identification cards. From now on, replacement cards for pioneers who move, change their name, lose their card, or request a change of assignment will be supplied by the Society. Any blank cards the secretary may have on file should be disposed of. Name changes and reassignments will be handled in the normal manner, with the secretary noting the appropriate information on the back of the Congregation Report (S-l) for the month. Thereafter, the Society will forward to the congregation the new cards for the pioneers. These will generally come with the monthly statement. Any changes should be forwarded to the Society promptly so that our files can be kept accurate and current. Also, when a pioneer discontinues such service or is deleted, a copy of the S-206 form should be filled out and submitted to the Society without delay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ All inquiries relative to dates and locations of district conventions in other lands should be directed to the respective branch offices. Addresses of branch offices around the world are found on the last page of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook. </span><span class="font9">■ Braille editions of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font9">are now available in Korean and Portuguese.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Question box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">■ What is the proper use of the terms “brother” and “sister”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When used in a literal sense, the terms “brother” and “sister&quot; refer to individuals who have the same parents. This natural relationship usually creates a warm attachment, and the closeness these individuals experience is further enhanced by social, environmental, and emotional ties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus taught his disciples to address Jehovah in prayer as “Our Father.&quot; The use of that expression implies that as Christians, we are all part of a close family circle where we eqjoy a rich spiritual relationship. This was further emphasized by Jesus when he told his followers that “all you are brothers.&quot;—Matt. 6:9:23:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because of our close spiritual ties within God’s household, we address one another as “Brother&quot; and “Sister,” particularly at congregation meetings. During these spiritual occasions, the one presiding over the meeting recognizes baptized individuals by using the expression “brother&quot; or “sister” followed by the last name of the person being addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What if an unbaptized person wishes to participate in the meetings? When a person has been associated with Jehovah’s people for some time and is approaching dedication, considering himself to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, there would be no objection to prefacing the last name with “Brother&quot; or &quot;Sister.” This would especially be true if the individual has become an unbaptized publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the other hand, interested persons who have only recently begun to attend our meetings have not yet taken the steps that would identity them as part of God’s household. These individuals would not be addressed as “Brother&quot; or “Sister,” since the spiritual relationship of God’s family does not exist in their case. So during the meetings, we would address them more formally, using an appropriate title such as “Mr.&quot; with their last name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Using the expressions “brother&quot; and &quot;sister” at our congregation meetings indicates a bond that Is far closer and more precious than any Indicated by the use of first names. It reminds us of the very blessed relationship we enjoy as a spiritual family under the one Father. Jehovah God. We are also reminded of the deep love and affection we have for one another—Eph. 2:19; 1 Pet. 3:8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Search Out Those Who Are Rightly Disposed</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> One purpose of the preaching work is to find those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (Acts 13:48) Distribution of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">magazines has proved to be an excellent way to accomplish this, as our Journals make people aware of the Kingdom hope. We will be featuring the magazines during April. Hopefully, where interest is found, we can start new Bible studies in the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font9"> Here are some suggestions that might work for you:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">- When using the April 1 “Watchtower,” you might feature “Praise the King of Eternity!,” which focuses on last year’s district convention public discourse, and say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Many people we talk to have faith in God. Others find it difficult to believe in him. How do you feel? [Allow for response.] We are surrounded by tangible evidence proving that there must be a God. [Read Psalm 104:24.] When we see a camera or a computer, we readily acknowledge that it must have been produced by an intelligent designer. Would it be reasonable to say that far more complex things, such as the earth and we humans, originated by chance?” Use a paragraph from the article to show a sound reason for believing in God. If interest is shown, offer the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> The April 15 “Watchtower” features the article “Why True</span><span class="font9"> W<sup>z</sup>or-</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">ship Receives God’s Blessing.” Beforepresenting it, you could ask:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “With the hundreds of religions existing in the world, do you think they could all be acceptable to God? [Allow for comment.] Jesus foretold that despite the claims of many religious persons, those not doing God’s will would be rejected. [Read Matthew 7:21-23.] It is important that we identify the true religion taught by Jesus.” Turn to the heading “What Fruitage Must True Religion Produce?.” beginning on page 16. and discuss one example to illustrate the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> When featuring the main topic in the April 22 “Awake!,&quot; “When</span><span class="font9"> Wars </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Will Be No More,” you might consider saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “In this century there have been hundreds of wars, including two world wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Yet virtually all world leaders say they want peace. Everybody I know says the same thing. If everyone wants peace, why can’t they achieve it? [Allow for response.] What do you feel is needed for us to see real peace on earth?” After householder’s response, turn to pages 8 and 9 and read such texts as Psalm 46:8,9. Using the pictures and scriptures quoted, show how God’s Kingdom will bring worldwide peace that will last forever. Then ask if the householder wishes to read the magazine, and arrange to return.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> If you find many who say they are busy, you might try this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “We are interested in helping people who live busy lives and who find little time to reflect on the spiritual side of life. Our journals, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font9"> are designed to provide concise information about important issues that affect you and your family. I’d like to leave these copies for you to read.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Be sure to give those who accept the magazines an opportunity to contribute toward our worldwide work. They will certainly benefit from reading </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font9"> which bring &quot;good news of something better.”—Isa. 52:7.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Faith Follows the Thing Heard”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> When we find someone who is “rightly disposed for everlasting life,” it is necessary to strengthen that person’s faith in what he has heard. (Acts 13:48; Rom. 10:17) To that end, we should follow up magazine placements by returning to bring the latest issues and to converse more. Where there is genuine interest, subscriptions may be offered. However, have in mind the goal of starting a study in the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font9"> Here are some suggestions that might be helpful:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> When making a return visit where you discussed the article “Praise the King of Eternity!,” you could begin this way:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “When we last talked, we reviewed some of the overwhelming evidence that proves there is an almighty God. However, just being aware of his existence is not enough. We need to know his name. By what name do you call God? [Allow for response.] Millions of people simply call him ‘Lord’ or ’God,’ which are impersonal titles. In addition, he wants us to know him by his name. [Read Psalm 83:18.] The Bible tells us much more about Jehovah God, as is explained in this book.&quot; Show the picture on page 29 of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book, and read the caption. After you discuss the first three paragraphs in chapter 3, you will have started a study!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> For those with whom you considered the article “Why Worldly Religion WillEnd,” you may want to follow up the interest by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “After reading the article, you may have been impressed with the fact that we cannot view all religions in the same way. Both true religion and false religions exist. This raises the logical question, Whose worship does God accept? The answer was provided by Jesus, and it is highlighted in this book.” Turn to chapter 5 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book, and read paragraph 4, including John 4:23, 24. Then ask, “Would you be willing to accept a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">free</span><span class="font9"> home Bible study?&quot; If the response is positive, turn to chapter 1 and start the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">* If interest was shown in the April 22 “Awake!,” when you return you might try this approach to start a study in the “Knowledge” book:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “You may recall we had a conversation about our prospects for eventually seeing a world without war. It’s hard to imagine what that would really be like. Here’s one artist's conception of it. [Show the picture on pages 188-9 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book.] Wouldn’t it be a pleasure to be able to enjoy these surroundings? [Turn to pages 4-5, show the picture, and read the box.) The title of this book is similar to Jesus’ words found at John 17:3. [Read.] If I may, I’d like to demonstrate how this book can be used with your Bible to find that lifesaving knowledge.” If the householder is willing, start the study in the first chapter.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> If you contacted a person who was busy when you initially called, you might say this when you return: </span><span class="font9">■ “I visited you recently and left copies of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazines. These journals build respect for the Bible and its moral guidance. Because I feel it is essential for everyone to understand God’s Word, I came back to show you something that will help you to do that.” Show the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book, and point to contents on page 3. Ask which chapter looks the most interesting, turn to it, and start the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Our joy will be great if we are able to ‘open to others the door to faith’ leading to everlasting life.—Acts 14:27; John 17:3.</span></p></li></ul>

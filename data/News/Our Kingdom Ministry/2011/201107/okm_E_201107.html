<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Be “Tenderly Compassionate”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Never before in history have so many people been in such dire need of compassionate assistance. Deteriorating world conditions have resulted in widespread feelings of unhappiness, depression, and hopeless</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ness.</span><span class="font9"> Millions need help, and we as Chris-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. What are people in dire need of today? </span><span class="font9">tians are in a position to demonstrate genuine concern for our neighbors. (Matt. 22:39; Gal. 6:10) How can such concern be shown?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font8"> A Work of Compassion: </span><span class="font9">There is no real, lasting comfort that does not originate with God. (2 Cor. 1:3, 4) Jehovah urges us to imitate him by becoming “tenderly compassionate,” and he has given us the commission to visit our neighbors with the good news of the Kingdom. (1 Pet. 3:8) Active participation in this work is the best way for us to comfort “the brokenhearted,” because God’s Kingdom is the only real hope for suffering mankind. (Isa. 61:1) Out of compassion for his people, Jehovah will soon act to clear away wickedness and establish a righteous new world.—2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font8"> View People as Jesus Did: </span><span class="font9">Even when preaching to large crowds, Jesus saw more than a mass of people. He perceived individuals having spiritual needs. They were like sheep with no shepherd to guide them. Jesus’ heart was touched by what he saw, and he was moved to teach them patiently. (Mark 6:34) Our viewing people the same way Jesus did will prompt us to show genuine compassion for them as individuals. This will be apparent in our tone of voice and facial expressions. Preaching will be our priority, and we will tailor our words to address each one’s personal concerns.—1 Cor. 9:19-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> A great crowd of people from all nations are responding favorably to the Kingdom message and the refreshing interest shown in them. As we continue to clothe ourselves with compassion, we will honor and please our compassionate God, Jehovah. —Col. 3:12.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">Song 91 and Prayer</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Are Your Children Ready?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The time is approaching for another school year to begin. Your children will no doubt experience new challenges and pressures. They will also have fresh opportunities to “bear witness to the truth.” (John 18: </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">37) A</span><span class="font9">re they ready?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. Why is there a need for schoolchildren to be prepared?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Do your children clearly understand what constitutes participation in nationalistic ceremonies and pagan holidays and why sharing in them is wrong? Are they prepared for the pressure they will receive to pursue higher education, date, and use alcohol or drugs? Would they simply say that an objectionable activity is against their religion, or do they know how to explain their beliefs? —1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font8"> Use the Family Worship Evening: </span><span class="font9">Of course, you will likely have discussions throughout the school year as the need arises. Your making a special effort to consider school-related matters before classes resume will give your children confidence. Why not use one or more Family Worship evenings for this? You might ask your children what causes them the most anxiety as they contemplate going back to school. Matters that you have considered in previous years can be reviewed now that the children are older and have increased understanding. (Ps. 119:95) You could include practice sessions in which you pretend to be a teacher, counselor, or fellow student. Teach your children how to answer from the Bible and to use such tools as the Reasoning book and the Young People Ask books. One parent used practice sessions to prepare her children to approach their new teachers at the start of each school year and inform them that they are Jehovah’s Witnesses.—See The Watchtower, December 15, 2010, pages 3-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> The challenges Christian youths must face during these last days are increasingly “hard to deal with.” (2 Tim. 3:1) Wise parents will try to anticipate them. (Prov. 22:3) Before the new school year begins, do all you </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">can t</span><span class="font9">o help your children be ready.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">2. In order to be prepared, what should your children know?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">3. How may parents use their Family Worship evening to prepare their children?</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Our Magazines—Designed to Have Wide Appeal</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Just as the apostle Paul adapted the way he presented the good news in order to gain “people of all sorts,” the faithful and discreet slave class uses our journals to reach people of different backgrounds and beliefs. (1 Cor. </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">9:22,</span><span class="font9"> 23) So that we can make good use of</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">1. How does the faithful and discreet slave class imitate the apostle Paul?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">The Watchtower and Awake! we do well to keep in mind the intended readership of these magazines.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font8"> Awake!: </span><span class="font9">This journal is aimed at reaching the same type of people as the apostle Paul spoke to when addressing the “men of Athens.” (Acts 17:22) Those men had a nonChristian background, and they had little understanding of the Scriptures. Likewise, the readership for which Awake! is designed has little or no knowledge of the Bible. They may know nothing about Christian teachings, they may be somewhat distrustful of religion, or they may be unaware that the Bible has practical value. A primary objective of Awake! is to convince its readers that the true God exists. The aim of this journal is also to build faith in the Bible and help the reader to understand that Jehovah’s Witnesses are different from other religious groups.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font8"> The Watchtower: </span><span class="font9">The intended readership of the public edition of this journal has a measure of respect for God and for the Scriptures. They have some knowledge of the Bible but do not understand its teachings accurately. They are similar to the audience Paul referred to as those who “fear God.” (Acts 13:14-16) The study edition of The Watchtower is written primarily for Jehovah’s Witnesses. Paul assumed that those who read his letters were familiar with the Scriptures and had an accurate knowledge of truth. (1 Cor. 1:1, 2) Likewise, articles in the study edition are written for those who attend our meetings and are familiar with Witness terms and concepts.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Although we normally offer the magazines as a set, we usually feature only one of them in our presentation. Therefore, make it your goal to be familiar with each issue.

<p><span class="font14">In the month of February 2011, the Turks and Caicos Islands reported two new all-time peaks: 295 publishers and 736 Bible studies. In the United States, when compared with the same six-month period last year, there were increases of 7 percent in regular pioneers and 8 percent in auxiliary pioneers. Bermuda too had an increase of 25 percent in auxiliary pioneers during the same time period. Truly, Jehovah’s servants are imitating his zeal for fine work!—John 5:17.</span></p>

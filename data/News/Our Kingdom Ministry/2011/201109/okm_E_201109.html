<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Treasure Your Privilege of Service</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many in Satan’s world consider our preaching work to be “foolishness.” (1 Cor. 1:18-21) If we are not careful, this distorted view can cause discouragement and diminish our zeal. (Prov. 24:10; Isa. 5:20) What reasons</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">1. How do many in the world view our preaching work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">are there to treasure our privilege of being Jehovah’s Witnesses?—Isa. 43:10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> A “Holy Work”: The apostle Paul referred to the ministry as a “holy work.” (Rom. 15: 15, 16) How is the ministry a “holy work”? Engaging in it makes us “fellow workers” with “the Holy One,” Jehovah, and contributes to the sanctification of his name. (1 Cor. 3:9; 1 Pet. 1:15) Jehovah views our preaching as “a sacrifice of praise,” so the ministry is a vital aspect of our worship.—Heb. 13:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Preaching the good news is a great honor that relatively few enjoy. The angels would gladly care for such an assignment and would no doubt do it extremely well. (1 Pet. 1:12) However, Jehovah has chosen us imperfect humans, “earthen vessels,” for this awesome privilege!—2 Cor. 4:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> A Priority: Because we truly treasure our privilege, we view the ministry as one of “the more important things” in our life. (Phil. 1: 10) Therefore, we schedule time each week to share in it. A musician who treasures his privilege to play in a world-renowned orchestra would prepare for each performance and work at developing his skill. Similarly, we will prepare before going in the ministry so that we can ‘handle the word of truth aright,’ and we will work at improving our “art of teach-ing.”—2 Tim. 2:15; 4:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Do not let the view of most people discourage you. Remember that there are still many in our territory who appreciate our visits. However, it is not the approval of humans that we seek. Far more important is how Jehovah feels, and he highly values our diligent efforts.—Isa. 52:7.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">2. Why can the ministry be called a “holy work”?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. What makes preaching the good news a great honor?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">4. How can we show that we treasure the ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">5. Our ministry is appreciated by whom?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When Jehovah gives humans an assignment, he also gives them the help they need to carry it out. For example, when Jehovah told Noah to build an ark, something Noah had never done before, He also told him how. (Gen. 6:14-16) When the meek shepherd Moses was assigned to approach the older men of Israel and Pharaoh, Jehovah assured him:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. When Jehovah gives humans an assignment, what does he also do?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">“I myself shall prove to be with your mouth and I will teach you what you ought to say.” (Ex. 4:12) When it comes to our assignment to preach the good news, Jehovah has not left us on our own. He is training us for this work by means of the Theocratic Ministry School and the Service Meeting. How can we benefit from this training?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The Theocratic Ministry School: Consider the scheduled material before attending each meeting. Then as you see how the students develop this information in their talks, your understanding of how to teach will be sharpened. (Prov. 27:17) Bring your Ministry School book to the meeting and use it as a workbook. When the school overseer refers to it after each student talk, underline key points that you want to apply, and use the margins to make notes. The best way to benefit from this school, however, is to participate. Are you enrolled? When you receive a talk assignment, prepare well and apply the counsel you receive. When in the ministry, use what you have learned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The Service Meeting: We will better remember the suggestions presented during this meeting by reading over the material in advance and preparing to comment. If we keep our comments brief, more will be able to have a share. Pay close attention to the demonstrations, and use any suggestions that you feel will make your ministry more effective. Keep a copy of key articles from Our Kingdom Ministry for future reference.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Like the assignments given to Noah and Moses, our commission to preach the good news in all the inhabited earth is challenging. (Matt. 24:14) We can be successful if we rely on Jehovah, our Grand Instructor, and make good use of the training he provides.—Isa. 30:20.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">Many in our territory, especially those who belong to non-Christian religions, are not acquainted with the Bible. When studying with such ones out of the Bible Teach book, some publishers have also used the Bible’s Message brochure to help their student gain an overview of the Bible. For example, one brother introduces section 1 of the brochure when considering chapter 3 of the Bible Teach book. Thereafter, he considers another section at the end of each study. Are you studying with someone who has had little or no exposure to the Bible? To help him learn ‘the holy writings, which are able to make him wise for salvation,’ consider supplementing the material in the Bible Teach book with the Bible’s Message brochure.—2 Tim. 3:15.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>QUESTION BOX</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Should prayer be offered at a doorstep Bible study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are many benefits to opening and closing a Bible study with prayer. By means of prayer, we ask Jehovah for his holy spirit on our discussion. (Luke 11: 13) Prayer also emphasizes to our student the seriousness of his Bible study and teaches him how to pray. (Luke 6:40) Therefore, it is good to introduce prayer as soon as possible. However, since circumstances vary, the conductor needs to use discernment in deciding whether to offer prayer at a doorstep Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One important factor to consider is the setting in which the study is held. If there is a measure of privacy, a brief prayer might be discreetly offered to open and close an established study. However, if doing so would draw the attention of onlookers or make the student feel uncomfortable, it may be better to wait until the study can be held in a setting that affords more privacy. Regardless of where the study is held, we should use good judgment to determine when to introduce prayer.—See the March 2005 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font12">page 4.</span></p>

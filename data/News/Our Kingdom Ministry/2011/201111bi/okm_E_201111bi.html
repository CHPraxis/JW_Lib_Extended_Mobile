<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Seeds Must Be Watered in Order</span><br><br><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark10"></a>to Grow</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Seeds planted in a garden must be watered in order to grow. The same is true with regard to seeds of truth that are planted in the hearts of people in our territory. (1 Cor. 3:6) We must make return visits and water these figurative seeds using God’s Word ifwe </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">want</span><span class="font10"> them to take root, grow, and flourish.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What must be watered in order for it to grow?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font9"> Raise a Question: </span><span class="font10">When you prepare your presentation, why not also prepare an interest-arousing question that you could answer on the return visit? Raise it at the conclusion of the initial conversation, and make definite arrangements to return. Many find it beneficial to choose something from the Bible Teach book that will allow them to demonstrate a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font9"> Make a Record: </span><span class="font10">As soon as you leave the initial call, take the time to make a record. Write down the person’s name and address. It is also good to note the date and time you spoke to him, what you talked about, and what literature you placed, if any. Did he say he belonged to a certain religion? Does he have a family? Did he mention his interests and concerns? Such information will help you tailor future conversations. Also write down when you agreed to return and the question you will answer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font9"> Persevere: </span><span class="font10">Satan will not rest in his efforts to ‘take away the word’ planted in a person’s heart. (Mark 4:14, 15) Therefore, do not give up if you have difficulty finding the interested person at home again. Could you send a letter or leave a note in the door? One pioneer started a doorstep study with a woman but was unable to find her at home again, so she sent a letter. When the sister eventually found her at home, the woman expressed how deeply touched she was by the personal interest shown to her. As we water seeds of truth, we can experience the joy that comes from seeing them sprout, grow to maturity, and “bear fruit thirtyfold and sixty and a hundred.”—Mark 4:20.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">■ </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Who should fill in coupons and Internet requests?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our publications often contain coupons that can be filled in and sent to the branch office to request literature or a visit from Jehovah’s Witnesses. In addition, our website </span><a href="http://www.watch-tower.org"><span class="font10">www.watch-tower.org</span></a><span class="font10"> can be used to request a Bible study. These provisions are helping many to learn the truth. However, problems have resulted when publishers have used these tools to make arrangements for their relatives or others to receive spiritual assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some who have been sent unsolicited literature from the branch office have complained, feeling that our organization is harassing them and has them on some sort of mailing list. Publishers who have received a notice to call on someone who did not personally request a visit have found themselves in an awkward position when the individual expressed irritation. Therefore, requests made on our website or by means of coupons should come from interested ones themselves and not from publishers in behalf of others. When such requests are identified as being sent in behalf of someone else, they are generally not processed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How, then, can we assist a relative or an acquaintance spiritually? If you would like him to receive literature, why not send it directly to him as a gift? If he has expressed interest and wishes to be visited by Witnesses but you do not know how to contact the elders in the local congregation, you should submit a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Please Follow Up</span><span class="font10"> (S-43) form to your congregation secretary, who will review it and forward it to the branch office. However, if the interested one is confined to a prison, a substance-abuse facility, or a hospital, you should not contact the branch office in his behalf. Rather, you could encourage him to contact the brothers who visit the facility or to write personally to the branch office.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What is it that enables someone to be a good Bible teacher? Secular education? Experience? Natural ability? Actually, it is the</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What is the most important quality of a good teacher?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">same quality that is the Law’s fulfilment, that identifies Jesus’ disciples, and that is the most dominant and appealing of Jehovah’s cardinal attributes. (John 13:35; Gal. 5:14; 1 John 4:8) It is love. Good teachers demonstrate love.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Love People: </span><span class="font10">The Great Teacher, Jesus, showed love for people, and this motivated them to listen to him. (Luke 5:12, 13; John 13:1; 15:13) If we care about people, we will witness at every opportunity. Obstacles such as persecution and apathy will not deter us. We will show sincere personal interest in those to whom we preach, and we will tailor our approach to meet their concerns. We will be willing to take time not only when we are with each Bible student but also when we are preparing for each study beforehand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Love Bible Truths: </span><span class="font10">Jesus also loved Bible truths and viewed them as treasures. (Matt. 13:52) If we love the truth, we will speak with enthusiasm, and this can stimulate excitement in our listeners. Such love will help us to focus on the valuable information we are imparting rather than on our personal limitations, and we may then be less nervous in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Cultivate Love: </span><span class="font10">How can we cultivate love for people? By reflecting on the love that Jehovah and his Son have shown and the dire spiritual condition of people in our territory. (Mark 6:34; 1 John 4:10, 11) Our love for Bible truths will deepen through regular personal study and meditation. Love is an aspect of the fruitage of the spirit. (Gal. 5:22) So we can petition Jehovah for holy spirit and ask him to help us grow in love. (Luke 11:13; 1 John 5:14) Regardless of our secular education, experience in the truth, or natural abilities, we can be an ef</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">fectiv</span><span class="font10">e Bible teacher by demonstrating love.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">“Have you ever wondered why there have been so many natural disasters lately? [Allow for response.] Interestingly, the Bible foretold a time that would be marked by disasters.

[Allow for response.] Although opinions vary on that question, it is generally agreed that no other book has been the object of so many efforts to destroy it. This magazine describes some of the efforts to destroy the Bible and suppress the reading of it down through the centuries. It also explains why it has survived.”</span></p>

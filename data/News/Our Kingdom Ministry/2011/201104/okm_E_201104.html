(John 13:35) Even if you are not able to speak to everyone, you can still warmly introduce yourself to people near you. (Heb. 13:1, 2) Be watchful for visitors who do not seem to know anyone. Likely they received an invitation during the campaign. You might ask, “Is this your first time here?” Invite them to sit with you, and offer to answer any questions they may have. If your congregation must leave quickly so that another congregation can use the facility, you might say: “I’d like to know what you thought of the program. Is there a way that I can contact you?”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Welcome the Inactive: </span><span class="font10">No doubt, inactive publishers will be present, including some who limit their association with the congregation to their annual attendance at the Memorial. Welcome them, and let them know that you are genuinely happy to see them. (Rom. 15:7) Elders can go by their home soon afterward to encourage them to continue their association with the congregation. It is our prayer that many in attendance will be moved to glorify God not just because of what they hear but also because of what they see ‘as a result of our fine works of which they are eyewitnesses.’ —1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">How long should we study with a progressive Bible student?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is best to continue studying with a progressive Bible student until he has completed two publications—What </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Does the Bible Really Teach?</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Keep Yourselves in God’s Love.”</span><span class="font10"> This is true even if the student gets baptized before finishing both books. After his baptism we may continue to report the time, the return visits, and the study. If a publisher accompanies us and participates in the study, he may also count the time.—See the March 2009 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font10">page 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is important for new ones to have a good foundation in the truth before they are left on their own. They need to be “rooted” in Christ and “stabilized in the faith” so as to withstand the trials they are sure to face. (Col. 2:6, 7; 2 Tim. 3:12; 1 Pet. 5:8, 9) Additionally, to teach others effectively, they must have “an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) By completing two books with our students, we are helping them attain a solid footing on “the road leading off into life.” —Matt. 7:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Before approving someone for baptism, elders should ensure that he </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">clearly understands primary Bible teachings and is living in harmony with them.</span><span class="font10"> Elders should be especially careful when considering a student who has not yet completed the first study book. If someone is not ready for baptism, the elders will make sure that he receives the necessary personal assistance in order to qualify for baptism in the future.—See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will,</span><span class="font10"> pages 217-218.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Many congregations have accumulated a supply of older publications. Why not obtain copies for your personal theocratic library? Of course, likely you already have access to the contents of some of these older publications in Watchtower Library. However, there are benefits to having a hard copy too. Are you studying with a progressive Bible student? Then encourage him to obtain these older publications and begin building his personal library. The Theocratic Ministry School overseer should make sure that the Kingdom Hall library contains any older publications that the congregation has in stock. These publications still have value. It is better for us to make use of them than to leave them at the congregation’s literature counter!</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The following questions will be considered at the Theocratic Ministry School during the week beginning April 25, 2011. The school overseer will conduct a 20-minute review based on material covered in assignments for the weeks of March 7 through April 25, 2011.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. In what sense was it that “many of the peoples of the land were declaring themselves Jews”? (Esther 8:17) [</span><span class="font10">w06 </span><span class="font11">3/1 p. 11 par. 3]</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font11">4. Why does knowing that Jehovah is “wise in heart and strong in power” instill confidence in us?

<li>
<p><span class="font11">5. In what way did the statement by Eliphaz that a man drinks in “unrighteousness just like water” reflect Satanic thinking? (Job 15:16) [</span><span class="font10">w10 </span><span class="font11">2/15 p. 20 pars. 1-2]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">6. What can we learn from Job’s strong outcry that we read at Job 19:2? [</span><span class="font10">w94 </span><span class="font11">10/1 p. 32 pars. 1-5]</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In this spiritually scorched land that is Satan’s world, Jehovah continues to refresh his servants. (Isa. 58:11) One provision Jehovah uses to invigorate us is the annual district convention. As the convention for this year approaches, how may we prepare to receive and impart spiritual refreshment? —Prov. 21:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> If you have not already done so, take time now to arrange your personal and secular work schedules to be present for all three days of the convention.

<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Program Times: </span><span class="font10">The program will begin at 9:20 a.m. all three days. The doors will open at 8:00 a.m. When the introductory music is announced, all of us should go to our seats so that the program can begin in a dignified manner. The program will conclude at 4:55 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and at 3:40 p.m. on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Parking: </span><span class="font10">At all convention sites where we control the parking, the spaces will be available to attendees at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. Only those with a state-approved license plate or placard for the disabled will be allowed to park in the area re-(Isa. 65:13, 14) Have your arrangements for lodging and transportation been completed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> What will help you to keep your mind from wandering during the sessions? If possible, get plenty of rest each night during the convention. Focus your eyes on the speaker. Look up every scripture in your Bible. Take brief notes. Families do well to sit together so that parents can help their children to pay close attention. (Prov. 29:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15) Perhaps you can discuss highlights of the program each evening as a family. So that your family can continue to be refreshed even after the convention, time could be allotted during your Family Worship evening to consider</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">specific points for your family to apply.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">served for them. Parking is usually limited, so carpooling should be done to the extent possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Seat Saving: </span><span class="font10">Seats may be saved only for those living in our home or traveling in our vehicle or for our current Bible students.—1 Cor. 13:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Noon Meal: </span><span class="font10">Please bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers and glass containers are not permitted in the convention facility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Donations: </span><span class="font10">We can show our appreciation for the convention arrangements by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at the convention. Any checks should be made the congregation who need assistance in order to attend the convention? Are you in a position to help them? (1 John 3:17, 18) Elders, especially group overseers, should see that such publishers receive the needed assistance.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> As in the past, three weeks before the start of our convention, we will share in a campaign to invite others to attend. Congregations should set a goal to distribute their allotment of invitations and cover as much of their territory as possible. Invitations that your family has left over at the end of the campaign should be brought to the convention for you to use when witnessing informally. Further information on this will be provided during the program on Friday. Invitations that your family does not expect to use while in the convention city should be given to an attendant when you enter the facility. Please keep one copy for yourself, as you will need to refer to it during the last talk on Sunday.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Accidents and Emergencies: </span><span class="font10">If a medical emergency arises at the convention site, please contact a nearby attendant, who will immediately notify First Aid so that our qualified first-aid personnel can assess the seriousness of the situation and render assistance. If it is necessary, our first-aid personnel will call 911. This will prevent emergency-response services from receiving many cell-phone calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Medication: </span><span class="font10">If you require prescription medication, please be sure to bring an adequate supply with you, since none will be available at the convention.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>How Will We Offer the Invitation?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In order to cover our territory, we should be brief. We might say something like this: “Hello. We are sharing in a global effort to distribute this invitation. Here is your copy. You will find more details on the invitation.” The front of the invitation is interest-arousing, so hand it to the householder in such a way that he can see it. Be enthusiastic. When sharing in the distribution on the weekends, the magazines should also be offered when appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">when many people are “lovers of themselves” and show a lack of regard for the feelings of others, how refreshing it is to be around fellow Christians who endeavor to display good manners! (2 Tim. 3:2) We show good manners by entering the building in a calm and orderly way when it opens at 8:00 a.m. and by saving seats only for those living in our home or traveling in our vehicle or for our current Bible students. We follow the chairman’s direction when he choose modest, well-fitting shoes that will allow one to walk safely on ramps, stairs, gratings, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Hearing Impaired: </span><span class="font10">The program will be broadcast in the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. To receive it, you will need to bring a small battery-operated FM receiver with earphones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Baby Strollers and Lawn Chairs: </span><span class="font10">Baby strollers and lawn chairs should not be brought to the convention site. However, child-safety seats are acceptable if they can be secured in a seat next to the parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Fragrances: </span><span class="font10">Most conventions take place in enclosed areas with mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be loving on our part to limit the use of strong fragrances, colognes, requests that we go to our seats to listen to the musical interlude introducing each session. It shows good manners to set our cell phone or pager so as not to distract others during the program. We also display good manners by not talking, texting, eating, or roaming the corridors needlessly during the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Refreshing Association: </span><span class="font10">Conventions give us extended opportunities to enjoy our refreshing Christian unity and brotherhood. (Ps. 133:1-3) Why not take the initiative to “widen out” and meet brothers and sisters who are present from other congregations? (2 Cor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">6:13) You might make it a goal to get to know at least one new person or new family each day. The midday break affords a good opportunity to do this. So bring a light lunch and enjoy eating and associating with others on the premises rather than leaving to purchase food or to eat in a nearby restaurant. This may lead to the blessing of new and lasting friendships.</span></p>

Could you volunteer to assist a department or help your congregation with its cleaning assignment?

<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Our Conduct Is Refreshing to Observers: </span><span class="font10">We are convention delegates during all three days of the convention, not just during the program. Those who observe us while we are in the convention city should be able to see a refreshing contrast between us and non-Witnesses. (1 Pet. 2: 12) Our dress and grooming at the convention site, at our place of lodging, and at restaurants should honor Jehovah. (1 Tim. 2:9, 10) If we wear our lapel badges, onlookers will be able to</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">(3) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it, and return it immediately so that others may use it.</span></p></li>

This may provide us with an opportunity to tell them about our convention and give a further witness.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> How may we cooperate with hotel and restaurant workers? We should not reserve more hotel rooms than we will actually use, as this prevents other delegates from obtaining rooms and makes it very difficult for the hotel to replace the lost business. If the hotel is busy at the time that we check in or check out, we should demonstrate patience and graciousness. (Col. 4:6) We should give the customary tip to servers at restaurants and to hotel workers who carry our bags, clean our room, and provide other services.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(7) Display the fruitage of the spirit in dealing with the hotel staff at all times. They are caring for a large number of guests and appreciate our kindness, patience, and reasonableness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(8) The room rate shown on the Recommended Lodging List is the full price per day, excluding tax. If you are overcharged or billed for things you did not request or use, refuse these charges and inform the Rooming Department at the convention as soon as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(9) If a problem arises with your hotel room, inform the Rooming Department while at the convention so they can assist you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(10) Please also note that if you use a debit or credit card when registering at a hotel, tions said this: “The people are very polite. We’re excited to have them every year.” Last year a non-Witness lost his wallet at a hotel used by convention delegates. When the wallet was returned to the hotel manager with all its contents intact, the manager told the owner: “It was a good thing for you that Jehovah’s Witnesses were attending their convention nearby, and the hotel was full of them. Otherwise you would probably not have had the wallet returned.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> This year’s conventions are fast approaching. Much time and effort have gone into making the program and the convention environment refreshing. Make it your aim to be present all three days, and be prepared for what Jehovah and his organization have in store for you. Be resolved to refresh others through your good manners, joyful association, and fine conduct. Then you and others may feel as did one of last year’s delegates who wrote, “I cannot recall a more satisfying experience!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">12. As the convention approaches, what should be our aim, and why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">it is standard practice for a hold to be placed on enough funds in your account to cover your total room cost, plus any possible damages or incidentals during your stay. You will not be able to use any of those funds until your account is settled within a few days after you depart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Service: </span><span class="font10">The happiness we gain from attending the convention will be even greater if we volunteer to assist with the necessary work involved. (Acts 20:35) Any who wish to do so should report to the Volunteer Service Department at the convention. Children under 16 years of age can also make a fine contribution by working under the direction of a parent or guardian or other adult approved by a parent or guardian.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark5"></a>We Are Never Off Duty</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Zealous first-century evangelizers declared the good news “without letup” wherever people were found. (Acts 5:42) So we cannot imagine that when going from house to house they would walk past people on the road without preaching to them too. </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Neith</span><span class="font9">er would they forgo an opportunity to</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. How do we know that first-century evangeliz-ers never considered themselves to be off duty? witness informally while shopping in the marketplace after finishing the field ministry. Like Jesus, they never considered themselves to be off duty.—Mark 6:31-34.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Always Ready: Our name, Jehovah’s Witnesses, does not just describe what we do; it describes who we are. (Isa. 43:10-12) So we are always ready to make a defence of our hope, even when we are not going from house to house. (1 Pet. 3:15) Do you anticipate situations that may allow you to witness informally and then think about what you might say? Do you keep literature with you to share with those who show interest? (Prov. 21:5) Do you preach only from house to house, or do you also spread the good news to people in other settings if circumstances allow?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Not “Alternative” Witnessing: In the past we sometimes used the word “alternative” to refer to preaching on the street and in car parks, parks, places of business, and so forth. However, “alternative” could seem to suggest that such efforts are out of the ordinary, unconventional, or optional. The apostle Paul said that he preached “publicly” and from house to house. (Acts 20:20) So “public” witnessing would be a more appropriate term than “alternative” witnessing. It is true that the house-to-house ministry continues to be our primary and most effective way of reaching people with the Kingdom message. However, first-century evan-gelizers focused on people, not houses. They took advantage of every opportunity to talk about the truth—publicly, informally, and from house to house. May we have the same mindset in order to accomplish our ministry </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">fully.</span><span class="font9">—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>QUESTION BOX</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">■ </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What determines whether we will leave literature with someone?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The primary factor is the person’s interest. If he demonstrates genuine interest, we may leave him two magazines, a brochure, a book, or other literature that we are offering. This is true even if we discern that he has little or no money to donate toward the worldwide work. (Job 34: 19; Rev. 22:17) On the other hand, we would not leave our precious literature with those who do not appreciate it.—Matt. 7:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How might a householder demonstrate interest? A willingness to converse with us is a good sign. Paying attention while we speak, responding to questions, and expressing an opinion indicate involvement in the discussion. Following along as we read from the Bible implies a respect for God’s Word. Often, it is helpful to ask if he would read the literature being offered. Publishers should use good judgment to determine the individual’s interest. When doing street witnessing, for example, it would not be appropriate to hand out magazines, brochures, or books indiscriminately to everyone who walks past us. If we are unable to determine a person’s interest, it would be better to give him a handbill or tract.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers should use good judgment to determine the individual’s interest</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">Similarly, the amount of literature a publisher obtains from the literature counter should be based on what the publisher needs in order to carry out his ministry, not on his ability to donate. Donations are not to pay for literature but to support all aspects of our worldwide preaching activity. Regardless of our financial means, appreciation will move us to give generously out of our want, not out of our surplus, to support Kingdom interests. (Mark 12:41-44; 2 Cor. 9:7) It will also prompt us to take only the literature that we need, thus not wasting theocratic resources.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark9"></a>A Good Way to Enjoy Kingdom Songs</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">God’s servants consider music to be a beautiful gift from Jehovah. (Jas. 1:17) Many congregations enjoy playing Kingdom songs softly before and af ter their congregation meetings. Playing theocratic music is a soothing way to welcome us to meetings. It helps us to get mentally prepared for worship. Additionally, playing newer tunes from our songbook acquaints us with the melodies and helps us to sing the songs properly. Such music played after the meeting maintains an uplifting atmosphere in which to enjoy encouraging association. Therefore, bodies of elders should make appropriate arrangements to play music from Sing to Jehovah—Piano Accompaniment before and after the meeting. They should make sure that the volume level is reasonable and does not drown out conversation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The following questions will be considered at the Theocratic Ministry School during the week beginning December 26, 2011.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Although some people conclude that Solomon’s words recorded at Ecclesiastes 3: 1-9 support belief in fate, how does what he wrote at Ecclesiastes 9:11 clarify matters, showing clearly that everything in life is not determined by fate? [w09 3/1 p. 4 par. 4]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. What danger is there in being “righteous overmuch”? (Eccl. 7:16) [w10 10/15 p. 9 pars. 8-9]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">5. How does Song of Solomon 2:7 indicate that those considering marriage are wise not to be hasty in choosing a mate? [w06 11/15 p. 19 par. 1; w80 4/15 p. 19 par. 7]</span></p></li>
<li>

<li>
<p><span class="font9">7. How do the titles “Wonderful Counselor,” “Mighty God,” and “Eternal Father” give us insight into the qualities of Jesus and his rule in the new world? (Isa. 9:6) [w91 4/15 p. 5 par. 7]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">8. Who today can be compared to the “apostate nation” of Israel, and who will serve as Jehovah’s “rod” to destroy it? (Isa. 10:5, 6) [ip-1 p. 145 pars. 4-5; p. 153 par. 20]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">9. Why is Isaiah’s prediction that Babylon “will never be inhabited” so remarkable, and what confidence does its fulfilment give us today? (Isa. 13:19, 20) [g 11/07 p. 9 pars. 4-5]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">10. When did Jesus receive “the key of the house of David,” and how has he been using that key? (Isa. 22:22) [w09 1/15 p. 31 par. 2]</span></p></li></ul>

What’s your opinion?” Allow for response. Then hand the householder the January 1 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> and consider together the material under the first subheading on page 16 and at least one of the scriptures.

<p><span class="font9">“We can learn many lessons from the great men and women of history. Would you agree? [Allow for response.] This verse refers to one great man, the only one called ‘God’s friend’ in the Bible. [Read James 2:23.] This magazine explains why God considered him his friend and discusses what we can learn from Abraham’s example.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“Bribes, kickbacks, and other forms of dishonesty have become quite common in the business world. Some feel that a certain amount of dishonesty in business is necessary in order to be successful. What do you think? [Allow for response.] Notice this thoughtprovoking proverb. [Read Proverbs 20:17.] This magazine explains why it is practical to be honest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service Highlights</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The month of August closed the service year on a high note. A total of 135,698 reported field service, just 125 short of the all-time peak we reached in April 2011. During the year, 2,739 symbolized their dedication by water baptism. Overall, the annual report showed a 1 per cent increase over last year’s average publishers. Ireland had a 2 per cent increase for the 2011 service year, with 140 baptized. There are now 1,537 congregations in Britain and 115 in Ireland. It is very encouraging to see the way in which Jehovah has blessed the zealous activity of Kingdom proclaimers in spite of the many problems brothers are facing.</span></p>

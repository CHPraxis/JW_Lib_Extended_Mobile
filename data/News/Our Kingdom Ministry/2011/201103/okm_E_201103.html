<p><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Memorial to Be Observed on April 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Moved by Jehovah’s many acts of mercy and deliverance, the psalmist asked: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me?” (Ps. 116:12) Today, God’s servants have even more reason for gratitude. Centu</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ries a</span><span class="font12">fter these inspired words were penned,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. What sentiment of the psalmist is especially appropriate during the Memorial season? </span><span class="font12">Jehovah gave mankind its greatest gift—the ransom. As we prepare to commemorate Christ’s death on April 17, we have good reason to show ourselves thankful.—Col. 3:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Ransom Blessings: </span><span class="font12">By means of the ransom, we are able to receive “the forgiveness of our sins.” (Col. 1:13, 14) This enables us to worship Jehovah with a clean conscience. (Heb. 9:13, 14) We can enjoy freeness of speech with Jehovah when we approach him in prayer. (Heb. 4:14-16) Those who exercise faith in the ransom have the grand prospect of everlasting life!—John 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Demonstrate Appreciation: </span><span class="font12">One way to show our deep appreciation is to consider the Memorial Bible reading each day and meditate on it. The February 1, 2011, Watchtower article entitled “Are You Prepared for the Most Important Day of the Year?” was designed to help us do this. We can also tell Jehovah through heartfelt prayer how much we value the ransom. (1 Thess. 5:17, 18) Our being present at the Memorial observance in obedience to Jesus’ command shows thankfulness. (1 Cor. 11: 24, 25) Furthermore, we can imitate Jehovah’s expansive love and invite as many as possible to attend with us.—Isa. 55:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Appreciative servants of Jehovah will not treat the Memorial observance as just another meeting. It is the most important meeting of the year! As the Memorial approaches, may our determination be like that of the psalmist who wrote: “Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and do not forget all his </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">doin</span><span class="font12">gs.”—Ps. 103:2.</span></p></li></ul>

I want to go, but I am not sure of the time.” The brother explained where this information could be found on the invitation. The woman concluded her conversation by promising, “I am going to your event tonight!”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> How We Will Do It: Since we have a limited time to cover the territory, it is best to be brief. We might say: “Hello. We want to give your family this invitation to an important annual observance that will be held worldwide on Sunday, April 17. [Hand the invitation to the householder.] That date is the anniversary of Jesus’ death. A free Bible talk will be given that explains how we can benefit from Christ’s ransom. This invitation shows the address and time of the meeting being held in our community.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If the congregation has a large territory, the elders may direct you to leave the invitations at not-at-homes, provided that they can be placed completely out of sight. Be sure to invite your return visits, relatives, workmates, schoolmates, and other acquaintances. When sharing in the distribution on the weekends, offer the magazines whenever appropriate. Could you auxiliary pioneer during April and have a greater share in this enjoyable campaign?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> What a powerful witness interested at-tenders will receive! They will hear of Jehovah’s great love in providing the ransom. ( John 3:16) They will learn how God’s Kingdom will benefit mankind. (Isa. 65:21-23) They will also be invited to approach the attendants and request a Bible study to learn more. It is our prayer that many honestheart-ed ones will respond to this campaign and </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">join u</span><span class="font11">s for the Memorial!</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Were You Once a Regular Pioneer?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Over the years, thousands have enjoyed the privilege of “teaching and declaring the</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. What privilege have many enjoyed, but what has become necessary for some?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">good news” as full-time ministers. (Acts 5: 42) Some, however, have had to discontinue pioneering for various reasons. If you were once a regular pioneer, have you examined your present circumstances to see if you can rejoin the pioneer ranks?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font4"> Circumstances Change: </span><span class="font11">It may be that the situation that caused you to stop pioneering no longer exists. For example, if you discontinued pioneering because you could not meet the requirement of 90 hours a month, could you resume now that the requirement has been reduced to 70? Have your employment needs or family responsibilities lessened since the time you left the pioneer ranks? One sister who stopped pioneering for health reasons was able to resume at age 89. She had not been in the hospital for over a year and felt that her health would allow her to pioneer again!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Perhaps you are not a former pioneer, but someone in your family stopped pioneering to provide care for a family member, such as an aged parent. (1 Tim. 5:4, 8) If so, could you or others in the family do more to assist? Why not discuss matters together? (Prov. 15:22) When family members cooperate so that one of them can pioneer, all can rightly feel that they are having a share.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Do not be discouraged if your present circumstances do not allow you to start pioneering again. Your readiness to do so pleases Jehovah. (2 Cor. 8:12) Use the skills you acquired as a pioneer in your present ministry. Make your desire a matter of prayer, and be alert for opportunities to adjust your circumstances. (1 John 5:14) Perhaps, in time, Jehovah will open to you “a large door that leads to activity” so that you can once again experience the joys of regular pioneering! —1 Cor. 16:9.</span></p></li></ul>

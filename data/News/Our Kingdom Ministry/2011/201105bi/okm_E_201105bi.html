<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“Let Your Light Shine”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> From dawn till dusk, the beauty of visible light brings praise to Jehovah God. Yet, it was another kind of light that Jesus invited his disciples to possess—“the light of life.” (John 8:12) Possessing this spiritual enlightenment is a special privilege that includes serious responsibilities. Jesus in</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">struc</span><span class="font11">ted: “Let your light shine before men,”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. What do we have the privilege to share? </span><span class="font11">thereby benefiting others. (Matt. 5:16) Amid today’s deep spiritual darkness, this light must be shared, and the need has never been greater! How can we, like Christ, let our light shine?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> By Preaching: Jesus used his time, energy, and resources to make the light of truth known to people in their homes, in public squares, on the mountaintops—wherever they could be found. He recognized the lasting value of providing true spiritual enlightenment. (John 12:46) To reach even more people, Jesus prepared his disciples to be “the light of the world.” (Matt. 5:14) They let their light shine by doing good to their neighbours and by sharing spiritual truths.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> God’s people take seriously the responsibility to “go on walking as children of light,” and they preach wherever people can be found. (Eph. 5:8) Simply reading the Bible or other Christian publications in public view during a work or school break can open the way for a Scriptural discussion. In this way, one young sister started a Bible study and placed books with 12 of her classmates!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> By Fine Works: Letting our light shine also involves our daily conduct. (Eph. 5:9) At work, at school, and in other public areas, Christian conduct stands out and creates opportunities to share Bible truths. (1 Pet. 2: 12) For example, the good behaviour of one five-year-old boy moved his teacher to call his parents. She said, “Never have I seen a child with such a strong sense of morality!” Yes, our ministry and fine conduct attract people to “the light of life” and bring praise to our God.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">2. How did Jesus show the importance of sharing spiritual light?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. How can we demonstrate genuine appreciation for the light of truth?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. Why does ‘letting our light shine’ include exemplary conduct?</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Could You Share in the Ministry on Sundays?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It was the Sabbath, a day when most Jews in Philippi rested. Paul and his companions were visiting the city during one of their missionary tours. No one would have criticized them for taking a well-deserved rest from their ministry on that day too. They, however, knew that Jews gathered out</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">side </span><span class="font11">the city to pray, so they took advan-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. What can we learn from the actions of Paul and his companions in Philippi? </span><span class="font11">tage of the opportunity to preach to them. How happy Paul and his companions must have been when Lydia listened and her entire household got baptized! (Acts 16:13-15) Since many today rest on Sunday, why not use part of this day to preach to them?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The Battle for Sunday Preaching: During 1927, Jehovah’s people were encouraged to spend a portion of every Sunday in the ministry. This resulted in immediate opposition. Many were arrested in the United States for violating Sunday Sabbath laws, disturbing the peace, and selling without a licence. But Jehovah’s people did not give up. In the 1930’s, they organized “divisional campaigns,” whereby publishers from surrounding congregations would converge to cover a territory. On occasions when publishers were arrested, there were so many of them that the authorities were overwhelmed. Do you truly appreciate the sacrifices those brothers made so that we can preach on Sunday without harassment?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> An Excellent Day to Preach: Many people are home from work on Sunday. They are usually more relaxed. Some churchgoers may be more inclined to talk about God on this day. If we have our meeting on Sunday, we are already dressed as we would be for the ministry, so why not plan field service activity before or after the meeting? If needed, prepare a light meal to take with you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> If we use a portion of Sunday for the ministry, we will still have time to get the rest that </span><span class="font10">we </span><span class="font11">need. And our rest will be accompanied with the satisfaction that results from engaging in sacred service. (Prov. 19: 23) We may even experience the joy of find</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing s</span><span class="font11">omeone like Lydia!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">3. What makes Sunday a good day to share in the ministry?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11">This form should be filled in when you find an interested person who does not live in your territory or who speaks a foreign language.

The only exception is if the person is deaf. If we meet someone who is deaf, regardless of whether he demonstrates interest, we should fill in an S-43 form. In such case only show the address, do not include a name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What should we do with the form after it is filled in? We should give it to the congregation secretary. If he knows which congregation to send it to, he may simply forward it to the elders of that congregation so that they can arrange to care for the interest. If he cannot determine the congregation, he will forward the form to the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If the interested person speaks a foreign language and lives in your territory, you may continue calling on him to cultivate the interest until he is contacted by a publisher from the appropriate foreign-language congregation.—See the November 2009 </span><span class="font10">Our Kingdom Ministry, </span><span class="font11">page 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">■ </span><span class="font10">Special Campaign in May: Publishers are experiencing increasing difficulty in locating those who still have faith in either the existence or the power of God. (2 Thess. 3:2; Acts 13:48) Even in the schools young children are taught the theory of evolution. Many grow up to become agnostics or atheists. Older people, who formerly had a strong faith in God, are becoming disillusioned as they experience the spiritual and moral decline of the church systems, and their inability to find answers to basic Bible questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We feel that a concerted campaign with the brochure Was Life Created? may cause young ones to think carefully before rejecting outright the existence of God. At the same time, it may rekindle the faith formerly embraced by others of a living, purposeful Creator whose Bible-based principles can confidently be followed and whose promises can be relied on to have complete success. (Isa. 55: 11) We encourage you to participate fully in this special campaign. We would appreciate receiving any interesting experiences you have during the campaign.</span></p>

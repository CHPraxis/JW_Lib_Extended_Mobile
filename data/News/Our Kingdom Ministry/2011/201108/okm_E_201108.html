(Isa. 43:10) God’s only-begotten Son, Jesus, held God’s name in the highest esteem, giving it first place in his model prayer.

We will also hear the symposium “Beware of Bringing Reproach on Jehovah’s Name,” which will help us to avoid becoming entrapped by four potential snares. The questions, What will help us to preach with zeal when people seem to show little interest? and, What will help us to carry out a meaningful ministry? will be answered in the talk “Why God’s Name Must Be Sanctified.” On Sunday we will enjoy a four-part symposium on how we can sanctify God’s name by our thoughts, speech, decisions, and conduct. New ones will especially appreciate the public address, “Jehovah Will Sanctify His Great Name at Armageddon.”</span></p></li>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Jehovah’s Witnesses —Organized to Share the Good News</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">For over 100 years, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been organized to share the good news. In what has become the greatest preaching campaign the world has ever known, we speak this message in hundreds of languages and in more than 230 lands. (Matt. 24:14) Why is this work necessary? How is it being accomplished on a global scale? The video Jehovah’s Witnesses—Organized to Share the Good News answers those questions by providing a close-up look at the many facets of our international activities. After watching the video, give consideration to the following questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How has this video enhanced your appreciation for </span><span class="font9">(1) </span><span class="font11">the effort Jehovah’s organization is making to share the good news? (2 Tim. 4:2) </span><span class="font9">(2) </span><span class="font11">the Bethel families around the world? </span><span class="font9">(3) </span><span class="font11">the educational training provided for missionaries and overseers? (2 Tim. 2:2) </span><span class="font9">(4) </span><span class="font11">the importance of starting each day considering a Bible text and preparing each week for congregation meetings? (Acts 17:11) </span><span class="font9">(5) </span><span class="font11">the benefits of attending our Christian gatherings? (Heb. 10:24, 25) </span><span class="font9">(6) </span><span class="font11">the blessings you will receive when Paradise is restored on earth? (Isa. 11:9) </span><span class="font9">(7) </span><span class="font11">the privilege you have to share in the ongoing harvest work?—John 4:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This video has proved to be an excellent tool for acquainting interested people with the worldwide work being done by Jehovah’s Witnesses. </span><span class="font9">(8) </span><span class="font11">When would it be good to show the video to our Bible students, relatives, and others? </span><span class="font9">(9) </span><span class="font11">What positive reaction have you seen when showing it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As we reflect on what Jehovah is accomplishing, we are moved to echo these sentiments of the psalmist: “Many things you yourself have done, O Jehovah my God, even your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us; there is none to be compared to you.” (Ps. 40:5) May we make good use of this video to help others develop appreciation for Jehovah and his organization!</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>‘Let God’s Will Take Place’</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We were created because of Jehovah’s will. (Rev. 4:11) Thus, it would be impossible to fulfill the purpose of our existence without learning and doing the will of God. This is not as easy as it may seem, forasmuch as we have to fight an inward tendency to do “the things willed by the flesh and the thoughts” or to do “the will of the nations.” (Eph. 2:3; 1 Pet. 4:3; 2 Pet. 2:10) Without God’s </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">help</span><span class="font11">, we would even risk being “caught</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1. What is the theme of the special assembly day program for the 2012 service year, and why is it appropriate that we consider this subject?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">alive by [the Devil] for the will of that one.” (2 Tim. 2:26) Our special assembly day program for the 2012 service year will help each of us to work in harmony with the third primary entreaty in the model prayer, namely, “let your will take place.”—Matt. 6:9, 10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font9"> Questions That Will Be Answered: </span><span class="font11">As you listen to the program, look for the answers to these questions: What is as important as hearing God’s Word? How can we go on perceiving what God’s will is for us? Why do we need to be willing to reach out to all sorts of people? How can we find a rich, satisfying life? Young ones, what do you need to prove to Jehovah? What rewards come from doing God’s will? Why is it urgent that we build up and encourage others?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Be sure to be in attendance and to pay careful attention to the program. A Bethel representative or a traveling overseer will likely be present as a visiting speaker. Before and after the program, feel free to speak with him and his wife, if he is married. When you return home, do not become “a forgetful hearer,” but review the program as a family and discuss how you can work in harmony with God’s will more fully.—Jas. 1:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Very soon those who are pursuing their own desires and who refuse to submit to the will of Jehovah will be destroyed. (1 John 2:17) We are therefore thankful that Jehovah has prepared this timely information to help us make the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">doin</span><span class="font11">g of God’s will our priority!</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. How can we benefit fully from this spiritual provision?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. Why is it important that we make the doing of God’s will our priority?</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Can You “Step Over Into Macedonia”?</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> About the year 49 C.E., the apostle Paul left Syrian Antioch for his second missionary trip. His intention was to visit Ephesus and other cities in Asia Minor. However, he received a spirit-directed invitation to “step over into Macedonia” instead. He and his companions gladly accepted, and they were privileged to establish the first congregation in that region. (Acts 16:9, 10; 17:1, 2, 4) Today, some parts of the worldwide field have a real need for more harvest workers. (Matt. 9:37, 38) Are you in a position to help?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Perhaps you have Paul’s missionary spirit but have not seriously considered moving to a foreign country. It may be, for example, that Gilead training is not a possibility for you because of your age or because you are a single sister or have minor children. Maybe you have not considered moving to a foreign land because you lack confidence that you could learn another language. Or you may be an immigrant living in your present country for economic reasons and thus hesitate to relocate. After prayerful consideration, however, you may find that such circumstances need not prevent you from moving to a foreign land where there is a need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font9"> Is Missionary Training a Requirement? </span><span class="font10">What enabled Paul and his companions to be successful? They relied on Jehovah and his holy spirit. (2 Cor. 3:1-5) Therefore, even if your circumstances do not allow you to receive special training, you can still preach successfully in a foreign land. Remember, too, that you are receiving ongoing training through the Theocrat</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ic Mi</span><span class="font10">nistry School and Service Meeting. And</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What caused Paul and his companions to go to Macedonia?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. Why have some not considered moving to a foreign country?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Why is missionary training not a requirement to preach successfully in a foreign land? </span><span class="font10">if you have the goal of attending Gilead or a similar school, your moving to another country to taste missionary service will give you valuable experience that you can use later if you are accepted for additional training.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font9"> Older Ones: </span><span class="font10">Spiritually mature older ones who are in reasonably good health can be a tremendous asset in countries that have a need. Have you retired from your secular work? Some who receive even a modest pension are able to manage quite well in a developing land where their expenses, including the cost of quality medical care, are much lower than in their home country.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> A retired brother from an Englishspeaking land, who is an elder and pioneer, moved to a popular tourist area in Southeast Asia to help an English-speaking group of nine publishers. The group preached to the 30,000 foreigners who lived in the area. Within two years 50 were attending the meetings. The brother wrote: “Moving here has brought me the most wonderful blessings I have ever enjoyed. Time does not allow me to relate even a fraction of them!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font9"> Single Sisters: </span><span class="font10">Jehovah has used sisters in a mighty way to spread the good news in countries where the need is greater. (Ps. 68:11) One young single sister had the goal of expanding her ministry in a foreign land, but her parents were understandably concerned for her safety. So she chose a country that was politically and economically stable, wrote the branch office, and received helpful, specific information. During the six years she lived in that country, she enjoyed many blessings. She states: “At home I would have had few opportunities for Bible studies. But serving where there </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">was a</span><span class="font10"> greater need enabled me to conduct</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">4. Why should older ones not discount the idea of their preaching in a foreign country? 5. Relate an experience of a retired brother who moved to a foreign land.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">6. Relate an experience of a single sister who moved to a country where the need was greater.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">many studies and really develop my teaching ability.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font9"> Families: </span><span class="font10">If you have children, does this necessarily prevent you from moving to a foreign land to further the good news? One family with two children, aged eight and ten, decided to try it. The mother writes of their experience: “We are grateful that we could raise our children here, because they associated with special pioneers and missionaries. Our lives have been enriched because of serving where the need is greater.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font9"> Language Concerns: </span><span class="font10">Does the thought of learning a foreign language prevent you from moving to another land? Your language is likely spoken in other countries that have a need for more Kingdom preachers. One English-speaking couple moved to a Spanish-speaking country that has a sizable population of English-speaking immigrants. After receiving information from the branch office concerning several English congregations that had a need, they chose one and visited it twice. They returned home, cut their monthly expenses, and saved money for a year. When they were ready to move, the brothers in that area helped them locate affordable housing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font9"> Emigrants: </span><span class="font10">Did you emigrate from your homeland, perhaps before learning the truth? There may be a great need for harvest workers in your native country. Could you consider moving back in order to assist? It will likely be easier for you to find work and accommodations than for someone who is from another country. You probably already speak the local language. In addition, people may be more willing to listen to the Kingdom message delivered by you than by someone they view as an outsider.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;"><sup>10</sup> O</span><span class="font10">ne man moved from Albania to Italy</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<li>
<p><span class="font9">8. Is it possible to serve in a foreign country without learning another language? Explain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">9, 10. What might those who emigrated from their homeland consider, and why? </span><span class="font10">as a refugee, secured a good job, and was sending money to his family in Albania. After coming into the truth, he began teaching Albanian to a group of Italian special pioneers who were moving there to serve where the need was greater. The brother writes: “They were heading off to the territory I had left. They didn’t know the language and were thrilled to go. My language and culture were Albanian. What was I doing in Italy?” The brother decided to return to Albania to help spread the good news. He says: “Do I regret having given up work and money in Italy? Not for a minute! I found real work in Albania. As far as I’m concerned, the work that really matters and brings lasting joy is serving Jehovah with everything you have!”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font9">How to Do It: </span><span class="font10">Before going to Macedonia, Paul and his companions intended to travel westward, but “they were forbidden by the holy spirit,” so they turned northward. (Acts 16:6) When they were close to Bithynia, Jesus blocked them. (Acts 16:7) Jehovah, by means of Jesus, continues to oversee the preaching work. (Matt. 28:20) Therefore, if you are considering moving to a foreign land, prayerfully seek Jehovah’s di-rection.—Luke 14:28-30; Jas. 1:5; see the box</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">“How to Know if a Country You Are Considering Has a Need.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> Ask for objective comments from your elders and other mature Christians. (Prov. 11:14; 15:22) Read material we have published about serving in a foreign land, and also do research on any countries that you are considering. Can you visit the country that you are interested in moving to, perhaps for more than just a few days? If you are serious about moving to another country, you may write to the branch office in that country for more information, using the address in the current Yearbook. However, rather than sending your letter directly to the branch office, give it to your local elders, who will add their comments before they send it on.—See Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will, pages 111-112.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>13</sup> The branch office will send you helpful information about the country to help you make decisions, but it is not in a position to provide sponsorship letters or to supply residency, visa, or other legal forms or to locate accommodations for you. These are personal matters that will require your careful study before you move. In addition, you will be responsible for contacting embassies or consulates to obtain information about visa requirements and work permits. Those who move should be in a position to care for their individual needs and legal require-ments.—Gal. 6:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>14</sup></span><span class="font9"> Countries Where the Work Is Restricted: </span><span class="font10">In some countries the local brothers and sisters must be very discreet in their worship. (Matt. 10:16) Publishers who visit or move there could inadvertently draw undue attention to our activity and imperil the safety of the local brothers. If you are considering moving to such a land, please write to your local branch office through your </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">body</span><span class="font10"> of elders before proceeding.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">14. What cautions are in order when visiting or moving to a country where the work is restricted?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>15</sup></span><span class="font9"> If You Cannot Move: </span><span class="font10">If you are not in a position to move to another country, do not be discouraged. Perhaps another “large door that leads to activity” is open to you. (1 Cor. 16:8, 9) Your circuit overseer may know of needs within driving distance of your home. Perhaps you could help in a nearby foreign-language congregation or group. Or you may be able to expand your ministry in your present congregation. Regardless of your circumstances, the important thing is that you are whole-souled in your worship. —Col. 3:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>16</sup> Do you know a spiritually mature Christian who has the goal of serving in a foreign land? Then give him or her support and encouragement! When Paul left Syrian Antioch, it was the third largest city in the Roman Empire (after Rome and Alexandria). With such a large territory, the Antioch congregation likely had a need for Paul’s assistance and would sorely miss him if he left. Yet, the Bible does not indicate that the brothers there discouraged Paul from leaving. It appears that instead of taking a narrow view, they remembered that “the field is the world.”—Matt. 13:38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>17</sup> Paul and his companions were richly blessed for responding to the invitation to step over into Macedonia. While they were in the Macedonian city of Philippi, they found Lydia, and “Jehovah opened her heart wide to pay attention to the things being spoken by Paul.” (Acts 16:14) Imagine the joy of Paul and his missionary companions when Lydia and her entire household got baptized! In many lands, there are hon-esthearted ones like Lydia who have not yet been contacted with the Kingdom message. If you “step over into Macedonia,” you may experience the joy of finding and helping them.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">During the months that we offer the Bible Teach book and a study on the initial call, we are encouraged to “offer an older magazine or any brochure that addresses the person’s interest” whenever the householder already has the book and does not accept the offer of a study. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Brochures and older magazines consider a variety of timely subjects. Something in one of those publications may touch the heart of the householder. Therefore, when packing your witnessing case, include several different brochures and older issues. If you do not have older magazines, perhaps you can obtain some from the magazine counter. Then, if the householder already has the Bible Teach book and does not agree to a Bible study, you can show him some of the magazines or brochures that you have and invite him to take what interests him. Thereafter, make arrangements to return to cultivate his interest. Perhaps a Bible study will eventually result.</span></p>

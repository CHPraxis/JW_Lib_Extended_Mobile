<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Help the Householder to Reason</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Which approach in the ministry is more effective—one that is dogmatic or one that helps the householder to reason and draw the correct conclusions? The apostle Paul </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">used</span><span class="font8"> the latter when speaking to Jews in</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. Which approach in the ministry is the best?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Thessalonica, and “as a result some of them became believers.” (Acts 17:2-4) What is involved in reasoning with others?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Consider Feelings and Background: A reasoning approach takes into account the feelings of those in the territory. Paul started a discourse to unbelieving Greeks at the Areopagus by mentioning things they likely knew and accepted. (Acts 17:22-31) Therefore, when preparing your presentation, consider the common beliefs and prejudices of people in your territory. (1 Cor. 9:19-22) If the householder raises an objection, try to find common ground, and build your conversation on that.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Use Questions Skillfully: We cannot give a traveler directions to help him reach his destination unless we know his current location. Similarly, we cannot help a householder to reach the proper conclusion unless we know his current opinion. Before reasoning with a listener, Jesus often asked questions to find out the person’s thinking. For example, when someone asked Jesus, “By doing what shall I inherit everlasting life?,” Jesus sought the man’s viewpoint before answering. (Luke 10:25-28) On another occasion, when Peter gave a wrong answer, Jesus skillfully used questions to correct his thinking. (Matt. 17:24-26) Therefore, if the householder asks a question or expresses a wrong opinion, we can use questions to help him to reason on matters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> When we help the householder to reason, we imitate the Great Teacher, Jesus, as well as other skillful evangelizers in the first century. We dignify the householder and show him respect. (1 Pet. 3:15) As a result, he may be more inclined to allow us to return.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">2. How may we imitate the example of Paul when we share the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3. How can we reason more effectively with others by the skillful use of questions?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">4. Why should we try to help the householder to reason?</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Have you ever held back from witnessing at school because you were afraid that you would be ridiculed? It certainly takes courage to speak up, especially if you are shy. What will help you?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Use Good Judgment: </span><span class="font9">Although school </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">can </span><span class="font9">properly be viewed as your person-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. What takes courage, and why?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2. When it comes to witnessing at school, how is good judgment involved? </span><span class="font9">al territory, remember that you are not expected to initiate spiritual conversations with everyone as you would when preaching from house to house. Use good judgment to determine when to speak. (Eccl. 3:1, 7) The subject of a class discussion or school assignment may give you an opportunity to express your faith. Or a fellow student may ask you why you do not participate in certain activities. Some Christians have informed their teachers at the beginning of the school year that they are Jehovah’s Witnesses and given the teachers literature that explains our beliefs. Others have left literature out on their desk so as to prompt questions from schoolmates.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Be Prepared: </span><span class="font9">If you prepare, your confidence will increase. (1 Pet. 3:15) So try to anticipate questions that may arise, and think about how you could respond. (Prov. 15:28) If possible, keep your Bible and a few publications, such as the Reasoning book, Young People Ask books, and material on creation at school, so that you can refer to them when needed. Ask your parents to include practice sessions during your family worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Be Positive: </span><span class="font9">Do not assume that your schoolmates will always ridicule you when you mention the truth. Some will likely admire you for your courage and may even listen. But do not be discouraged if no one responds. Jehovah will be pleased that you tried. (Heb. 13:15, 16) Continue asking him to help you to ‘keep speaking with all boldness.’ (Acts 4:29; 2 Tim. 1:7, 8) Imagine how thrilled you will be when someone does listen. That person may even end up becom</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing a</span><span class="font9"> fellow servant of Jehovah!</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Are You Learning All You Can From Jehovah?</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah, our “Grand Instructor,” wants us to be educated. (Isa. 30:20) He began teaching after he created his firstborn Son. (John 8:28) After Adam’s rebellion, Jehovah did not stop teaching, but he lovingly provided instruction for imperfect humans.—Isa. 48:17, 18; 2 Tim. 3:14, 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Today, Jehovah is directing the greatest educational campaign in history. As prophesied by Isaiah, millions around the globe are streaming to the figura</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">tive</span><span class="font10"> “mountain of the house of Jeho-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. How does Jehovah feel about education?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2. What educational campaign is now under way?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">vah.” (Isa. 2:2) Why stream there? To be instructed in God’s ways, yes, to be taught by Jehovah! (Isa. 2:3) During the 2010 service year, Jehovah’s Witnesses spent over 1.6 billion hours witnessing and teaching people Bible truth. Additionally, each week spiritual instruction is imparted in more than 105,000 congregations earth wide, and educational Christian publications are produced by the faithful and discreet slave in well over 500 languages.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font8"> Benefit Fully: </span><span class="font10">How we have benefited from divine education! We have learned that God has a name and that he cares about us. (Ps. 83:18; 1 Pet. 5: 6, 7) We have learned the answers to some of life’s most important questions: Why do people suffer and die? How can I find real happiness? What is the purpose of life? Jehovah has also given us moral guidance that enables us to ‘make our way successful.’—Josh. 1:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In addition, Jehovah makes available specialized education to help a number of his servants expand their service to him. Pages 4-6 list opportunities that are available to some. Even if our circumstances prevent us from receiving the training that is listed, are we taking full advantage of the divine education that is available to us? Are we encouraging young ones, who are often steered by schoolteachers and others to pursue the world’s higher education, to set spiritual goals instead and pursue the highest education—divine education? Learning all we can from Jehovah will help us to enjoy a happy life now and an everlast</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing f</span><span class="font10">uture.—Ps. 119:105; John 17:3.</span></p></li></ul>

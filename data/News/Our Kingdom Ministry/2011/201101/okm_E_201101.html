<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Great joy filled the hearts of those who witnessed physical healing in the first century. (Luke 5:24-26) In our day, we rejoice in the work of spiritual healing. (Rev. 22:1, 2, 17) How exciting it is to read experiences in which Jehovah’s Word and holy spirit transform the lives of individuals! Even</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> What is God’s name? Why does he permit suffering? What will God’s Kingdom do for mankind? We find pleasure not only in answering such questions but also in seeing the joy radiate from the student when he learns the truth. (Prov. 15:23; Luke 24:32) As a student progresses, he may begin to use Jehovah’s name, make changes in his dress and grooming, shed harmful practices, and start witnessing to others. If he progresses to dedication and baptism, he will become our brother and fellow worker. Each of these positive steps is a reason to rejoice.—1 Thess. 2:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Can You Have a Share? If you would like to participate in this most enjoyable work, ask Jehovah for the privilege of conducting a Bible study, and then work in harmony with your prayers. (1 John 5:14) Preach where and when people can be found. Offer a Bible study on every appropriate occasion. (Eccl. 11:6) When you find interest and plant a seed of truth, return to water it.—1 Cor. 3:6-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Countless people yet remain who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness. Who will help to fill their spiritual need by conducting a Bible study with them? (Matt. 5:3, 6) Let us offer ourselves willingly to help complete the preaching and disciple-making work before the harvest comes to an end.—Isa. 6:8.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Help for Families</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The Sabbath observance was a loving provision from Jehovah that benefited families. Israelites rested from their regular labors and had time to reflect on Jehovah’s goodness and on </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">their</span><span class="font12"> relationship with him. Parents</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1. How did the weekly Sabbath benefit Israelite families?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">could take advantage of this opportunity to inculcate the Law into the hearts of their children. (Deut. 6:6, 7) The Sabbath provided time each week for Jehovah’s people to focus attention on their spirituality.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Of course, Jehovah no longer requires families to observe the Sabbath. However, that law teaches us something about our God. He has always been deeply interested in the spiritual welfare of his people. (Isa. 48:17, 18) Today, one way that Jehovah expresses this loving interest is by means of the Family Worship evening.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> What Is the Purpose of the Family Worship Evening? In January 2009, the Congregation Book Study began to be held on the same evening as the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting. One reason for this adjustment was to give families an opportunity to fortify their spirituality by scheduling a specific evening each week for family worship. Each family was encouraged to move its family study to the night formerly used for the book study, if practical, and to use this time for unhurried Bible discussion and study tailored to the needs of the family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> In order to attend the Congregation Book Study, we needed time to dress, travel, and so forth. For many of us, attending this one-hour meeting took the better part of the evening. </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">With</span><span class="font12"> the adjustment to our meeting</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">2. What does the Sabbath teach us about Jehovah?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. What is the purpose of the Family Worship evening?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. Must the family limit their discussion to one hour? Explain.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">schedule, we now have this evening to worship Jehovah as a family. Therefore, we need not limit our Family Worship evening to just one hour. Rather, we should think about the needs and limitations of our family and set the time period accordingly.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Must the Entire Time Be Spent in Group Discussion? When married couples and families with children discuss Scriptural topics together, they encourage one another. (Rom. 1:12) The family draws closer together. Therefore, Scriptural discussions should be the centerpiece of the Family Worship evening. However, each family member could also spend time in personal study. For example, after the group discussion, the family might remain together while each individual continues to study separately, perhaps finishing his preparation for the meetings or reading the magazines. Some families choose to keep the television off the entire evening.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> How May the Discussion Be Conducted? The format need not always be a question-and-answer discussion. In order to make the Family Worship evening lively and interesting, many families have a program that is similar to our midweek meeting. They divide their discussion into several parts and handle them in a variety of ways. For example, they might read the Bible together, prepare for a portion of the meetings, and have practice sessions for the ministry. Page 6 provides some </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">sugg</span><span class="font12">estions.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">5. Must the entire time be spent in group discussion? Explain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">6. How may the discussion be conducted?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> What Atmosphere Should Parents Strive For? Your family will learn best in a loving, relaxed atmosphere. You might sometimes study outdoors if the weather is favorable. Feel free to take breaks when needed. Some families include refreshments after the program. While parents will avoid using the Family Worship evening to scold or discipline, they may need to devote some of the time to address a specific trend or problem that has come to their attention. However, it may be best to discuss sensitive personal issues privately with a child at another time during the week so as to avoid embarrassing him in front of his siblings. The Family Worship evening should not be a dry, somber occasion but should reflect the happy God whom we worship. —1 Tim. 1:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> How Can the Family Head Prepare? The family will benefit most if the family head prepares in advance for each Family Worship evening by determining what should be discussed and how best to consider it. (Prov. 21:5) A husband does well to consult with his wife regarding this. (Prov. 15:22) Family heads, why not also occasionally ask your children for their recommendations? If you do, you will gain valuable insight into their interests and concerns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> On most weeks the family head will not have to spend extensive time preparing. Likely, the family will enjoy having certain regular features each </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">week</span><span class="font12">, and the family head will not</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">7. What atmosphere should parents strive for?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">8, 9. What preparation is required of family heads?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">need to come up with an entirely new program every time. He may find it advantageous to prepare after each study while his family’s spiritual needs are fresh in mind. Some family heads write out a brief agenda and post it where the family can easily see it, such as on the refrigerator. This creates excitement and anticipation and gives the family time to prepare if needed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> What If I Am the Only One in My Family? Those who live alone can use the Family Worship evening for personal study. A good basic personal study program should include reading the Bible, preparing for meetings, and reading The Watchtower and Awake! Some publishers supplement this with a personal study project. On occasion, they may wish to invite another publisher or</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">family to join them for an upbuilding Scriptural discussion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> What Are the Benefits of Having a Regular Family Worship Evening? Those who wholeheartedly engage in true worship draw closer to Jehovah. Additionally, families who worship together strengthen family bonds. One married couple wrote regarding the blessings they have enjoyed: “As a pioneer couple without children, we really look forward to our Family Worship night. We feel like we are drawing</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">10. How can those who live alone use their Family Worship evening?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">11, 12. What are some of the benefits of having a regular Family Worship evening?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Family Worship evening should not be a dry, somber occasion but should reflect the happy God whom we worship</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">closer to each other and to our heavenly Father. Now when we wake up on the day that we have scheduled to study together, we say to each other: ‘Guess what tonight is? Family Worship night!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> The arrangement of having an evening for family worship also helps busy families. One single mother who is raising two sons and regular pioneering wrote: “In the past, our family study suffered. It was sporadic and inconsistent because I was tired. I just couldn’t figure out how to fit it in. So I am writing you to thank you so very much for the Family Worship evening. We have been successfully having a regular family study and experiencing the benefits.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>13</sup> Like the Sabbath, the Family Worship evening is a gift from our heavenly Father that can help families. (Jas. 1:17) The way that Israelite families used the Sabbath determined how much they benefited spiritually. Similarly, how we use the evening that we have been given for family worship determines how much our family will benefit. (2 Cor. 9:6; Gal. 6:7, 8; Col. 3:23, 24) By making good use of this arrangement, your family can echo the sentiments of the psalmist: “But as for me, the drawing near to God is good for me. In the Sovereign Lord Jehovah I have placed my refuge.” —Ps. 73:28.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah invites young ones to praise him. (Ps. 148:12, 13) Christian parents, therefore, do more than teach their children Bible truths and God’s moral laws. They also train them to be ministers of the good news. How can this be done progressively?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Good Example: </span><span class="font11">Judge Gideon told his 300 men: “Learn from watching me.” </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">(Judg</span><span class="font11">. 7:17) Children naturally watch and</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">2. How can a parent’s good example affect his children?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">imitate their parents. One father works at night, but instead of going to sleep when he comes home Saturday morning, he takes his children in the ministry even though he is very tired. Without saying a word, he is teaching them that the ministry is a priority. (Matt. 6:33) Do your children observe you joyfully engaging in various forms of worship, such as praying, reading the Bible, commenting, and preaching? Of course, you will not be a </span><span class="font10">perfect </span><span class="font11">example. But your children will be more inclined to respond to your efforts to teach them to worship Jehovah if they see your diligence in serving him.—Deut. 6:6, 7; Rom. 2:21, 22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Progressive Goals: </span><span class="font11">Parents tirelessly train their children to walk, to talk, to dress themselves, and so forth. As children reach milestones in their growth, new goals are put before them. If the parents are Christians, they also help their children set and reach </span><span class="font10">spiritual </span><span class="font11">goals in accord with their age and abilities. (1 Cor. 9:26) Are you teaching your children to give comments in their own words and to prepare their own talks in the Theocratic Ministry School? (Ps. 35:18) Are you training them to engage in various aspects of the ministry? Are you setting before them the goal of baptism and full-time service? Are you actively bringing them into contact with joyful, enthusiastic evangelizers who will encourage them? —Prov. 13:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The psalmist said: “O God, you have taught me from my youth on, and until now I keep telling about your wonderful works.” (Ps. 71:17) Begin training your children at an early age to become ministers. The spiritual foundation that you help them lay is sure to benefit them into adult-hood!—Prov. 22:6.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Memorial Season—An Opportunity for Increased Activity!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Can you increase your share in the ministry during the upcoming Memorial season?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. What reasons do we have to consider increasing our activity during March, April, and May?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Many places will experience good weather and longer hours of daylight. Some publishers will have vacation from work or school that they can use for the ministry. Beginning on April 2, we will enjoy a special campaign to invite interested ones to attend the Memorial with us on April 17. Thereafter, we will endeavor to develop the interest of those who attended and invite them to the special talk that will be given during the week of April 25. Indeed, there are many reasons to consider increasing our activity during March, April, and May.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Auxiliary Pioneering: One excellent way to do more is to auxiliary pioneer. Since we are all busy, this generally requires planning ahead and making adjustments in our schedule. (Prov. 21:5) Perhaps you can postpone some nonessential activities in your normal routine. (Phil. 1:9-11) Why not express your desire to pioneer to others in the congregation to see if they can join you as an auxiliary pioneer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> During your next Family Worship evening, it would be good to discuss your goals as a family. (Prov. 15:22) With cooperation, perhaps some members of the family can auxiliary pioneer one or more months. What if you determine that this is just not possible? The family can still arrange to increase their activity by sharing in the ministry on some evenings or by staying out longer on the weekends.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah takes note of all we do to serve him and appreciates our sacrifices. (Heb. 6: 10) Joy results from giving to Jehovah and to others. (1 Chron. 29:9; Acts 20:35) Could you increase your activity this Memorial season and reap the increased joy and blessings that result?</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark5"></a>“Bearing Thorough Witness” About God’s Kingdom</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> During the week of March 14, 2011, we will begin consideration of “Bearing Thorough Witness” About God’s Kingdom at the Congregation Bible Study. This publication covers the book of Acts in such a way that the reader can feel the excitement of the fast-moving events recorded therein. Instead of providing a verse-by-verse commentary, the Bearing Witness book draws lessons from the accounts in</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">1. What will we consider at the Congregation Bible Study beginning the week of March 14?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Acts and helps us to see how we can make personal application.—Rom. 15:4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Features of the Book: The introduction on page 2 is a warm letter from the Governing Body expressing how they want us to benefit from this publication. Beginning with chapter 2, a focus line explains the thrust of each chapter and a Scripture citation indicates the portion of Acts that will be discussed. Many of the chapters contain informative boxes that offer background information about people, places, or events. Wide margins allow us to make notes. Throughout the book are richly detailed illustrations of Biblical scenes to help us visualize important events, and on the last page is a helpful image index to explain what is being depicted in various pictures. Inside the front and back covers are maps to assist us in following the progress of fellow worshippers in the first century as they began spreading the good news “to the most distant part of the earth.”—Acts 1:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Answers to Important Questions: Consideration of the book of Acts will help us to discern clearly the answers to important questions about the Christian ministry. For example, what work and message identify true followers of Jesus Christ? Who directs this worldwide preaching work, and how? What opportunities do persecution and opposition create for ministers? What role does the holy spirit play in our ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> In order to benefit to the full, study the material in advance and prepare to share in the congregation’s discussion. Be present at each meeting, and reflect on how you can apply the lessons learned in your personal ministry. May our consideration of this exciting publication stimulate us to bear thorough wit</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ness </span><span class="font10">about God’s Kingdom!—Acts 28:23.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Daily Text No Longer to Be Considered at Meetings for Field Service</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In the past, meetings for field service might have included a brief discussion of the daily text if it related to the ministry. This is being adjusted. Examining the Scriptures Daily should no longer be used as a basis for discussion during meetings for service. As before, conductors may make use of the Bible, Our Kingdom Ministry, the Ministry School book, the Reasoning book, and other material related to the ministry. Those assigned to conduct should prepare to share something practical to help those going in the ministry that day. As in the past, the length of the meeting should be no more than 10 to 15 minutes and should be shorter if it follows a congregation meeting.</span></p>

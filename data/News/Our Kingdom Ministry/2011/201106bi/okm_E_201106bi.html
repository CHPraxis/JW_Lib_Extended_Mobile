<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Our Ministry—Characterized by Patience</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Patience is a hallmark of God’s dealings with mankind. (Ex. 34:6; Ps. 106:41-45; 2 Pet. 3:9) One of the foremost examples of his lov-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. How has Jehovah demonstrated patience with mankind?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">ing patience can be seen in connection with the worldwide Kingdom-preaching work. Jehovah has worked with mankind for almost 2,000 years, and yet he continues to draw honest-hearted ones to himself. ( John 6:44) How can our ministry mirror Jehovah’s patience?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> House-to-House Ministry: </span><span class="font9">We imitate Jehovah’s patience by preaching “without letup” in territory where individuals have not yet demonstrated interest. (Acts 5:42) We patiently endure indifference, ridicule, and opposition to our ministry. (Mark 13:12, 13) We also demonstrate patience by persisting in our efforts to water seeds of truth even when it is difficult to find interested ones at home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Bible Studies: </span><span class="font9">Growing a plant requires patience. We can nurture it, but we cannot rush its growth. (Jas. 5:7) Similarly, spiritual growth occurs gradually and in stages. (Mark 4:28) Those we study with may find it hard to abandon false religious beliefs or unscriptur-al customs. We should not try to speed up growth by pressuring our students to make changes. Patience is required to allow a reasonable amount of time for God’s spirit to work on the heart of the student.—1 Cor. 3: 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Unbelieving Relatives: </span><span class="font9">Although we strongly desire that our unbelieving relatives learn the truth, we show patience by waiting for the right time to share our faith with them, being careful not to overwhelm them with too much information. (Eccl. 3:1, 7) In the meantime, we let our example speak for us, and we remain ready to express our faith with a mild temper and deep respect. (1 Pet. 3:1, 15) Indeed, a ministry characterized by patience will be more effective and will please </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">our h</span><span class="font9">eavenly Father.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Street Witnessing That Is Effective</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> During his earthly ministry, Jesus did not hesitate to speak with people he met on the road and in other public places. (Luke 9:5761; John 4:7) He wanted to share his important message with as many people as possible. Today, street witnessing is an excellent </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">way </span><span class="font9">to help people obtain godly wisdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What is one way we can imitate Jesus?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">(Prov. 1:20) Our success will be enhanced if we take the initiative and use discernment.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Take the Initiative: It is generally better to approach individuals rather than to stand or sit in one place waiting for passers-by to approach you. Smile, make eye contact, and have a calm, friendly manner. If you are working with other publishers, it is usually best to approach people separately. Initiative is also needed to follow up on the interest that you find. If appropriate, at the end of the conversation, kindly ask how you may contact the person again. Some publishers do street work regularly at the same location, enabling them to speak to the same people repeatedly and further their interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Use Discernment: Use good judgment in deciding where to stand on the street and whom to approach. It is not necessary to witness to every passer-by. Be observant. If the person is in a hurry, for example, it may be best to let him pass. When witnessing in front of a business place, be discreet so as to avoid causing undue concern to the manager. It is often better to witness to people as they leave the business rather than as they enter. Approach people in a way that will not frighten or startle them. Also, be discerning when offering literature. If individuals display little interest, you may offer a tract instead of the magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Street witnessing enables us to scatter many seeds of truth in a short period of time. (Eccl. 11:6) Some people we meet may even be those we are unable to find at home when working from house to house. Why not make arrangements to engage in street witnessing, an enjoyable and effective form of field service?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">2. How is initiative involved when doing street work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. How may we use discernment when doing street witnessing?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font9">Have you ever asked that question? General guidelines are found on pages 86-87 of the Organized book. Additional direction is occasionally provided, such as in the Question Box of the September 2008 Our Kingdom Ministry. Since circumstances vary, we have not been given a long list of rules. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for elders or others to set forth additional guidelines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If a question arises and there is no published direction on it, each publisher can consider: Was the time spent in the ministry? Or was it spent doing something else that is not actually part of that work? What we write on our personal field service report each month should give us joy and not pangs of conscience. (Acts 23:1) Of course, our primary concern is, not how to count time, but how to make our time count by being industrious in the ministry.—Heb. 6:11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When we received this new book, we were intrigued by its title, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.</span><span class="font11"> To single out one man as the greatest would mean that he excels above all the billions of humans who have ever lived upon this earth. “Great” is defined as being “superior in character or quality.&quot; The man who qualifies for that designation must be outstanding indeed!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Jesus Christ, the Son of God, fully deserves such recognition. What he achieved on earth had nothing to do with wealth, secular accomplishments, or political rulership. He came from a humble background and spent most of his life in relative obscurity. When he turned 30 years of age, however, he began to capture the attention of all in the land of Palestine by what he said and did. He revealed the personality and purposes of Jehovah God in a way never before experienced by man. He accomplished the greatest preaching work ever done by one man. performed outstanding miracles, and laid the foundation for a new world society.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> The Need for This Book: </span><span class="font11">Paul urged us to “look intently&quot; at Jesus as our exemplar and role model. (Heb. 12:2) From 1985 to 1991, the Society published in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> 149 consecutive articles on the life and ministry of Jesus. These articles made all of us more keenly aware of what Jesus said and what he did for us. They emphasized the need for us to imitate his example. All this material has been condensed and made available to us in book form. What a fine instrument to help others to look intently at Jesus and to become subjects of the one that Jehovah has placed “far above every government and authority and power and lordship”!—Eph. 1:21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup>0utstanding Features: </span><span class="font11">When offering the book, you might ask: “What made Jesus the world’s greatest man?” You could answer that by pointing to a few of the 133 chapters that focus on his life, his personality, his teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">demonstrate the depth of our devotion and the genuineness of our dedication by doing our utmost in the ministry. (2 Tim. 2:15) There are opportunities open to each of us according to our individual situation. What are some of these?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Ways to Expand Our Ministry: </span><span class="font11">We should first be interested in improving the quality of our ministry. This can be accomplished by developing more skill as a teacher. One of the main objectives of the Theocratic Ministry School is to help us to become more effective in the field ministry. Do we think in terms_Qf field service when preparing our assignments? Do we apply counsel we receive so that we can improve our personal ministry? </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(sg</span><span class="font11"> pp. 96-9) Likewise, many suggestions for the field ministry are given during the Service Meeting. Let us use these as soon as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Next, consider the possibility of adjusting your circumstances so as to share in the auxiliary or regular jfio-neer work. Doing so will certainly keep and his works. Chapter 24 explains his purpose in coming to earth. Chapter 35 reviews his famous Sermon on the Mount. Chapter 43 highlights Jesus’ remarkable ability to teach others by illustrations. Chapter 133 gives a glimpse of the blessings mankind will enjoy when he completes his work. You may find it helpful to use the questions at the end of each chapter to stimulate discussion; the cited scripture references show where the account can be found in the Bible. You can point out the striking illustrations that reveal the force of Jesus’ personality, the depth of his compassion for others, and his tireless zeal in preaching.—Note chapters 44,95,117, and 123.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> We will be offering this new book during December. Its unique features give us good reasons to recommend and offer it to others with great enthusiasm. Everyone who wants everlasting life must take in knowledge about Jesus Christ. (John 17:3) Our zealous efforts to distribute this book can make it possible for the lives of many sincere ones to be touched by the greatest man who ever lived.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">you busy in the service of our Father, Jehovah. (1 Cor. 15:58) What if you are not able to pioneer? You can demonstrate a pioneer spirit by cultivating a genuine dove for the ministry and a deep concern for people in the territory. You can also use every opportunity to help sincere ones to know Jehovah and his wonderful purposes by making return visits.and conducting Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">'Responding to the call to serve where the need is greater may also be part of our advancement. (Isa. 6:8) Those who have moved to a congregation that needed help on the servant body or that was looking for assistance in covering its territory have certainly reaped many blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’When we first learned_the truth, love for Jehovah and Christ Jesus moved us to make major adjustments in our lives. Now, as we grow in appreciation of our relationship with our heavenly Father and of what his Son did in our behalf, are there other adjustments that we can make in order to expand dur ministry? Let all of us expend ourselves by &quot;Keeping busy in Jehovah’s service—Rom. 12:11.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Question Box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">■ How can joy be expressed by those attending baptisms?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Baptism is a joyful occasion. We delight to see new ones taking their stand on Jehpvah’s side, publicly demonstrating their faith. (Ps. 40:8) Jesus said that this was cause for great joy in the heavens. (Luke 15: 10) Family members and publishers who studied with those getting baptized are especiallyjoyf</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ul to see</span><span class="font11"> new ones take this essential step. But how can such Jov b</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">e pr</span><span class="font11">op</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">erly e</span><span class="font11">xpressed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jesus‘Tjaptisrn_set the example for Christian baptisms today. He appreciated that it was a serious and solemn step he was about to take. He was praying as he was baptized. (Luke 3:21, 22) He knew that baptism is a time for meditation and sober thought. His disciples also recognized the importance of baptism. Following the outpouring of holy spirit on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E., about 3,000 were baptized. What was the reaction of the disciples who witnessed that event? “They continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to sharing with one another, to taking of meals and to prayers.” (Acts 2:41,42) The disciples reflected on spiritual things and shared hospitality with one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Christian assemblies in modern times have been highlighted by baptisms. It is certainly proper to express our joy by applause and commendation when we see individuals take their stand for Jehovah. On the other hand, displays of unrestrained cheering, whistling, waving of arms overhead, and calling out names would be inappropriate Such conduct shows a lack of appreciation for the seriousness and sacredness of this expression of faith. Neither would this be an appropriate time for a showy display of giving flowers or other gifts to baptized ones as they emerge from the pool. Baptism marks the beginning of the Christian race for salvation. We can rejoice and be encouraging to those being baptized by helping them appreciate the close relationship with Jehovah that baptism opens up for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The baptism site would not be a proper place for Jesting, playing, swimming, or other conduct that would detract from the seriousness of the occasion. Our joy should be expressed in a dignified manner. Our orderliness and seriousness will contribute to the Joy of all present.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Sharing in</span><br><br><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Kingdom Expansion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “What amazing changes!” “How fast it happened!” “What a blessing for our brothers in the Soviet U</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">nion</span><span class="font12">!”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> These expressions were heard in late August and early September when a series of conventions in the Soviet Union was successfully held despite potential interference. Altogether, 74,252 atte</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">nde</span><span class="font12">d seven Soviet conve</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ntion</span><span class="font12">s this summer, and 7,820 were baptized. In addition, 295,924 more assembled in Eastern European conventions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Surely, as in the first century, the prophet Isaiah’s words are having a fulfillment:,“The people that were walking in the darkness have seen a great light.... You have made the nation populous; for it you have made the rejoicing great. They have rejoiced before you as with the rejoicing in the harvesttime.” Yes, Kingdom expansion is moving forward! Jesus Christ rules! And as the prophecy cont</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">inue</span><span class="font12">s&gt;“To the abundance of the princely rule and to peace there will be no end.&quot;—Isa. 9:2,3,7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Caring for the marvelous increase in Eastern Europe has required the ongoing construction of much larger printing facilities in Germany. Our brothers there are delighted to support this expansion, which contributes directly to the fulfillment of Jesus’ historic prophecy: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.”—Matt. 24:14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;»</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Even greater expansion is proceeding here in the United States. At “the Gilead graduation in September, it was announced that the next class of Gilead, beginning in April, will be doubled to about 50 students! Eventually, the school will be located at the Watchtower Educational Center, which has been under construction now for almost three years at Patterson, New York. No wonder many are heard to ask: “How are things going at Patterson?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> The Patterson Complex: </span><span class="font12">We are happy to report that the work is going along at a fast pace and is ahead of schedule. All seven buildings of the Patterson Inn—a 150-unit hotel located within a short walking distance of the educational center—have been completed, as well as all the attendant work on roads, parking lots, and landscaping. When the educational center is finished, the nearby inn will be used to accommodate visitors from around the world. In the meantime! however, it is occupied by about 300 Bethel family members _ who are engaged in construction of the complex.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Altogether, there are now over 650 volunteer workers on the project! Many of these have been provided housing in the area, and they commute daily to and from the work site. Earlier this year a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span><span class="font12"> reporter wrote: ^Sitting like a city on a hill overlooking Route 22 here in northeastern Putnam County, the complex is a beehive of construction activity ... All—engineers, architects, draftsmen, carpenters, concrete workers, electricians, plumbers and laborers—are church members who volunteer to work from weeks to years. They receive no pay, but get a monthly stipend for incidental expenses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> The educational center will eventually consist of 17 buildings, including a kitchen, classrooms, offices, garages, six residence buildings that will accommodate 1,200, and a dining room and an auditorium, each of which will seat 1,60.0. At this time, two buildings of the complex have been completed, four are under construction, and five more will be started during 1992. Construction of the final six buildings will begin later. A milestone, was reached this summer when accreditation of the wastewater treatment plant and water treatment plant was received from state and local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">’The volunteer workers on the project are receiving fine spiritual benefits. In fact, all who qualify as volunteers must be spiritual persons. (1 Cor. 2:14,15) Each work morning a discussion of the day’s Bibletext is enjoyed. Three days a week, preassigned commentators from among the volunteer workers themselves share in the discussion, and on other mornings an audio hookup allows the Patterson volunteers to listen in on the discussion coming from the Brooklyn headquarters. In addition, on Monday evenings a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> Study is conducted for the benefit of all the volunteers on the project. Yet, Patterson is not th</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">e only major</span><span class="font12"> construction pr</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">oject</span><span class="font12"> in progress in New York.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, DECEMBER 1991</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> How About Brooklyn?: </span><span class="font12">On August 30,1990, a happy Bethel family applauded the announcement that a building permit had been issued to the Society to erect a 30-story residence facility. The following month demolition began on the old nine-story factory standing on the site. Then, in January 1P91, excavation began on the new building’s 100- by 200-foot foundation. Soon that excavation, 30 feet below sidewalk level, was completed. Engineering precautions were needed because a subway tunnel lies on one side of the building site and an existing factory of the Watchtower Society on the opposite side.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> Within six months the foundation work was completed. The two floors located below ground level will accommodate a kitchen, food storage, and other support services, as well as a dining room for over a thousand persons. The massive steel columns and beams that make up the framework of the building weigh over 7,000,000 pounds. In July the erection of this framework began. By September the brick masonry work was started, and soon the building’s color and shape will be a feature of the Brooklyn skyline!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> The work by the commercial construction company engaged by the Society will be completed next summer. This means that the shell of the 378-foot-high building will then be turned over to the Society, and Witness volunteers will finish the building. We hope to have the first, 12 floors, including the lobby, dining room, and kitchen, ready for use late in 1993. Since all available living accommodations in Brooklyn are occupied, this new home is vital to the fulfilling of our Scriptural commission. —Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> What Can You Do?: </span><span class="font12">Already brothers and sisters have done much. Over the years more than 14,000 volunteers from all over the United States have come to New York and helped with various building projects. Their labors of love have been very much appreciated, and the Society wants to thank them, as well as their wives and other family members who have supported their efforts. The question is, Can you make yourself available to work on these present projects?—Heb. 13:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>14</sup> Obviously, not all can. But you can still do much. For example, many elders and ministerial servants can assist in caring for congregation needs while volunteers </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">are serv</span><span class="font12">ing temporarily at headquarters. (Compare Nehemiah 4:19-22.) Another vital way to assist is through voluntary contributions to help with the expenses. An estimate published in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span><span class="font12"> fval-ued the new [Patterson) complex when completed at about $130 million.” <sub>?</sub> With volunteer help the final cost of the project will probably be less than half of that, but it will still be very substantial. Millions of dollars are now being spent each month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>15</sup> There was also need of considerable material wealth to build the tabernacle in Moses’ day, as well as the temple that was constructed under Solomon’s direction. However, Jehovah moved the hearts of the people to provide all that was needed. (Ex. 35:4-6, 21, 22; 36:3-6; 1 Chron. 29:3-9) In our day individuals, congregations, and circuits have been contributing for these building projects that will no doubt have an important part in the expansion of the Kingdom proclamation worldwide. Can you share in supporting this marvelous expansion work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>16</sup> If you can, please send such contributions to Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>17</sup> If you are not in a position to make an outright donation but you do have some funds that you would like to let the Society use'for a period of time and then receive back at your request, please writeto the Society concerning the conditional donation arrangement. Details explaining it will be mailed to you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>18</sup> Whether you are able to volunteer to work at the construction sites or to contribute in a monetary way or not, all of us can pray for the success of these building projects to the end that God’s Kingdom interests are expanded earth wide. May our heavenly Father prosper all of us as we endeavor to finish his work.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Over the years, virtually every one of our publications has in some way touched on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. That is very fitting, since “there is no salvation in anyone else, for there is not another na</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">me unde</span><span class="font11">r heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.&quot; (Acts 4:12) This new book is unique in that it is the first time one of our books has been devoted exclusively to the life of Jesus.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Offering It to Othersi </span><span class="font11">What are some interesting features in this publication that we can point out? Chapter 5 raises an appropriate question for this time of yw. “Jesus' Birth—Where and When?<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark13">1</a></sup><sup></sup> You might capture the interest of a youngster with the exciting account in chapter 44, “Silencing a Terrifying Storm.” A pereon experiencing physical illness or infirmity would surely be com-forted’by chapter 57,/;Compassion for the Afflicted.”, Chapter 90, “The Resurrection Hope.&quot; should appeal to any person who has ever mourned the loss of a loved one. A discussion about distressing world conditions could lead into chapter 111, “Sign of the Last Days.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> At the door you might say this: “What does God expect of us as Christians? The Bible directs us to imitate the example set by the world's greatest man, Jesus Christ. [Read 1 Peter 2:21.] He taught his followers to love their neighbors, keep morally clean, and pray for the coming of God’s Kin</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">gdom</span><span class="font11">. Our salvation depends on recognizing and obeying Jesus as our Savior. [Read John 14:6.] Jesus was no ordinary man. This book describes him as the greatest man who ever lived. Chapter 59 confirms this, identifying him as ‘the Christ, the Son of the living God.' Since we depend on him fop salvation, don’t you feel there is a need for us to learn as much as possible about his work_and what he taught? This book has been prepared especially for that purpose, and I would be pleased to make this copy available to you.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">* Likely you will find many sincere people who will accept and read this book. Be sure to follow up all your placements. In some instances you may decide to use this new book for starting home Bible studiesjt will be especially good for a family study and for studies conducted with youngsters.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Ministry School Provides Theocratic Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Elders carry a heavy load of responsibility. Beginning in 1959, arrangements were made for a &quot;special training course in overseers' activity&quot; to help them care for this weighty assignment. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(JP</span><span class="font11"> PP- 292-3; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">yb77 p.</span><span class="font11"> 14) Ministerial servants were invited to attend for the first time in 1984. The last Kingdom Ministry School was held during the 1988 service year, and tens of thousands benefited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Since then, hundreds of congregations have been formed and thousands of brothers have been appointed as elders and ministerial servants. Also, organizational adjustments have been made. Therefore, the Governing Body arranged for all congregation elders and ministerial servants to attend the Kingdom Ministry School during this service year. The new course has been tailored to meet the current needs in the field. Bethel representatives and some of the traveling overseers will take the lead in teaching at the school. Benefits to all congregations will be realized as the elders and ministerial servants apply what they learn from the school.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneering—A Service That Brings Rich Rewards</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">' Jehovah wants us to rejoice and to see good for all our hard work. (Eccl. 5:18) The most imp</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ortant work</span><span class="font11"> we can be involved in is the kingdom-preaching and disciple-making activity. Paul exhorted Timothy: “Do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.&quot; (2 Tim. 4:5) He encouraged Timothy, and Paul’s words encourage all of us today to be whole-souled in our ministry. For some, whole-souled service may include serving as a regular pioneer. Why not prayerfully consider whether your circumstances willallow you to take up the full-time ministry?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Positive Action Needed: </span><span class="font11">To get into the pioneer work requires taking decisive steps in harmony with our prayers. Cultivate’a heartfelt desire for Jehovah’s service, along with a love for people. Increase your activity in the field, building up return visitsand Bible studies. Work at developing a practical schedule; be realistic. Seek out suggestions from the elders and pioneers. Stick to a well-thought-out routine Tor sharing in the preaching work? Selfdiscipline, initiative, and deter</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">mina</span><span class="font11">tion are necessary. (1 Cor. 9:23, 25, 27) These are among the positive steps taken by more than 10,000.who have enrolle</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">d in recent months</span><span class="font11">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Setting definite goals and diligently working toward them will enable us to be progressive in our preaching as we refine our abilities. Can we improve our introductions at the door or the way we deal with objections? Do we make full use of all the literature available? Are we conducting'a progressive&quot;^ible study? Can we begin auxiliary pioneering now with the thought of regular pioneering later? Goals must be practical and set according to what we are able to accomplish. Attaining such goals will Improve our effectiveness and bring us much satisfaction.—1 Tim. 4: 15,16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">* A Rewarding Way of Life: </span><span class="font11">Pioneering with a proper motive and the desire to make spiritual progress brings many benefits. We develop a stronger reliance on Jehovah. Greater skill, in handling God's Word comes from regular use of it in the ministry. A wholesome influence is exerted on the congregation, and others may be encouraged to have a greater share in the ministry because of our zealous example. Pioneering can help us gain a more spiritual outlook on life and serve to protect us from worldly ambitions, desires, and associations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Jesus told his followers: “The harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his har-vest.”(Matt. 937,38) The need for workers is' even greater </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">now</span><span class="font11"> than it was in Jesus’ day.

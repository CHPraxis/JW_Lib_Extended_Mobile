<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ Be Patient and Thorough in the Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul maintained a keen sense of respo</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">nsibilit</span><span class="font12">y before Jehovah to be patient anq thorough as he preachecTthe good news to all who would hear. He confidently told the assembled overseers from Ephesus: (“I do not make my soul of any account as dear to me, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received of the Lord Jesus, to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">.y(</span><span class="font12"> Acts 20:24) </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Do we sense the nece</span><span class="font12">ssity laid upon us to do likewise?—1 Cor. 9:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IN OFTEN-WORKED TERRITORY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Patience is especially necessary when our territory is worked quite often. Despite limited territory, we should be moved to_call again and again. Put forth* effofFto contaeLaU the occupants in each home, and progressively help sincere persons.to appreciate the Bible-based hope of God’s Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> When our territory is worked frequently, another benefit of being patient is that we can get p</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ersonally </span><span class="font12">acqua</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">inted with the householders</span><span class="font12">. This may make them feel more comfor</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">table in opening their doo</span><span class="font12">r. There are excellent suggestions in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book that we can use to vary our introductions in often-worked territory.—See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning, </span><span class="font12">pages 9-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> There may be occasions when we call on people who, while manifesting some interest, will not accept our literature. How should we react? Our endeavor to be thorough will move us to persevere in developing that inter-e§.t. Cultivating what has been planted in their hearts_may move them eventually to accent a </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Bible stud</span><span class="font12">y. One brother made calls on an interested householder for five consecutive weeks without placing literature. On the sixth </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">visit</span><span class="font12">, the householder accepted literature, and eventually a Bible study was started.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Whole-Souled in the Field Ministry </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 1: The Value of Appreciation for Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Being whole-souled in the ministry stems from a deep appreciation of Jehovah and all that he has done for us. (2 Sam. 22:2, 3) An empathetic view of the plight of all mankind alienated from God should move us to exert ourselves in service. (Matt. 9:36; 2 Cor. 5:14,15) The more devoted we are to Jehovah and the more concerned we are for people, the more we will be motivated to share enthusiastically in the field service. (Matt. 22:37-39) Our ministry then becomes a treasure to be highly prized. (2 Cor. 4:7) But how can such</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFERING THE BROCHURES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> During July and August, our Top-ic.for Conversation will be “A New World—By </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Whom</span><span class="font12">?&quot; This topic is sufficiently flexible to use when presenting any one of the following brochures : </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, “Look! I Am Making AU Things New,” Should You Believe in the Trinity?, The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever,</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Government That WiU Bring Paradise.</span><span class="font12"> If we take time to become J</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">aipiliar with</span><span class="font12"> these hra.-chures, we will find a number of appropriate talking points to use with the Topic for Conversation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> For example, we could introduce ourselves and then say: i^What are your thoughts on man’s promise to bring about world peace? [Allow response.] Consider how the Bible comments on man’s abilities in this regard. [Read Jeremiah 10:23J Throughout the centuries, man has proved that he is really not capable of ruling himself. However, note God’s reliable promise. [Read 2 Peter 3:13.] So God’s sure promise of a new earth will come true.’’/Then we could encourage the householder to read one of the brochures. If we are using the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Look!”</span><span class="font12"> brochure, we could direct the householder’s attention to what is stated on page 30, paragraph 58^ When offering </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">the~Governrfi.ent</span><span class="font12"> brochure, we could highlight what is stated in the first paragraph on p</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">age 3</span><span class="font12">.. The picture on the front of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">LifeEarth</span><span class="font12"> brochure is quite appealing and fits in with the Topic for Conversation. Also, the third paragraph on page 3</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">1 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Divine Nam</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">e </span><span class="font12">brochure can be used.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Patientjy and thoro</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ughl</span><span class="font12">y covering our territory with the good news will result in salvation to those who listen to us. (1 Tim. 4:16) Time is running out! Therefore, may we exercise patience and bear thorough witness as we have a full share in preaching this message of salvation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">appreciation for the ministry be cultivated?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">KEYS TO BUILDING APPRECIATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Personal and congregational Bible study along with prayerful meditation help us to develop a personal relationship with Jehovah. We come to discern the beauty of his qualities and personality. Do you follow a schedule for weekly Bible reading? Do you regularly set aside time to study the Society’s publications? Do you prepare for, attend, and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Ministry &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">participate in all congregation meetings? (Heb. 10:24, 25) During and after each personal study period, purposeful meditation will build heart appreciation for the pleasantness of our warmhearted God and his arrangements for true worship.—Ps. 27:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Another way we can heighten our level of appreciation is to consider closely the example of other whole-souled ministers of God. The prophet Jeremiah was consumed with ardor for the work entrusted to him. (Jer. 20:9) Jesus left a pattern, displaying about taking up the full-time work. Interview two or three pioneers, and outline the many benefits of full-time service. New service year a fine time to begin. Those who start by September 1, 1991, may qualify to go to the Pioneer Service School in the summer of 1992.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Song 67 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JULY 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 210</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Elder</span><span class="font12">&lt;or qualified </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ministeri</span><span class="font12">al se</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">rvan</span><span class="font12">t handies local announcements. Ask audience for talking points from available brochures. Pick points that fit in with the Topic for Conversation and that will build an appreciative spirit and zeal. (John 4:34) By his labors in the ministry, the apostle Paul demonstrated his gratitude for divine mercy shown him. (1 Tim. 1:12, 13, 17) As we reflect on such examples, as well as examples from modern times, we can build an appreciation that will make us whole-souled in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When we learn about the glorious splendor of Jehovah’s dignity and concern ourselves with his wonderful works, we are moved to declare his greatness and cry out joyfully to his praise. (Ps. 145:5-7) We show that we treasure our opportunities to bear householder’s anticipation for reading the brochure.

Consider points on which elders feel congregation needs assistance. May Scriptural-ly consider some items that were brought to the congregation’s attention during the last visit of the circuit overseer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">witness to the divine name by actively seeking ways to spread the Kingdom message.—Luke 6:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> But are there other things that will motivate our whole-souled participation in the ministry? If so, what are they? How can elders, ministerial servants, pioneers, and other experienced Kingdom proclaimers help? What part do goals play in cultivating enthusiasm? What benefits can be expected? These questions and others will be answered in this five-part series, which will be continued in succeeding issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The Congregation Book Study plays a vital role in the spiritual development of Jehovah’s people. In the months ahead, we will examine various aspects of the Congregation Book Study arrangement and consider how we can benefit. In this issue we want to focus on how the book study conductor can make the study encouraging and faith strengthening.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In order to be effective in his teaching, the conductor should prepare well. As a serious student of God’s Word, no</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">t only must he kn</span><span class="font12">ow the answer to each question but he should also </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">understand </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">why</span><span class="font12"> that answer is correct. His endeavor should be to&quot;asSistaIl m the study to know the r</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">easons fo</span><span class="font12">r th</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">e answ</span><span class="font12">ers.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">’GOALS IN CONDUCTING THE STUDY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> One goal of the conductor is to use the material in the study to strengthen the faith of all in attendancs'lmd' mo</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">tivat</span><span class="font12">e them to want to do God’s will more fully. (Ps. 110:3; 2 Thess. 1: 3-5) To accomplish this, the conductor must pause at appropriate places to ‘sound down’ points that build heartfelt confidence in Jehovah, his Word, and his organization. (Gal. 6:6, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Ref. Bi.</span><span class="font12"> ftn.) Skillfully framed questions can be used to draw out these ^aith-building details as time allows. , |(<sup>4</sup> Another goal is to help all see how thejrcan use the material in a practical way. Hb'W can TTi?y Use it in the fielcT ministry? In encouraging the brothers as well as new ones?

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Carrying Our Own Load of Responsibility</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The idea of responsibility seems to burden people today. Many try to shirk it. As a result, husbands abandon wives, mothers forsake children, youths drop out of school, and citizens evade taxes. The list of irresponsible actions goes on and on. A responsible person is one who is trustworthy, willing and able to answer for his conduct. Therefore, God’s Word clearly states of Christians that “each one will carry his own load.” (Gal. 6:5) How appropriate that the circuit assembly theme for the 1992 service year is “Carrying Our Own Load of Responsibility”! This series will begin in September. All of us should make definite plans to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> By means of talks, skits, demonstrations, experiences, and interviews, this fine circuit assembly program will clearly outline the various should try to d</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">jscern the p</span><span class="font12">r</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">actical u</span><span class="font12">se of specific..points in the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Certain information may be used to help unbelieving relatives, school-mates<sub>4</sub> or workmates. Other material may assist~those in divided households or perhaps in one-parent families. The conductor may draw out those in attendance by helping them </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">to reason and see h</span><span class="font12">ow theyjnay make practTcaTapplication of the material being considered. The conductdr<sup>-</sup>should strive to keep the study interesting, making it more than simply a question-and-answer coverage of the material.—Compare 1 Corinthians 14:9,19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SHOW PERSONAL INTEREST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> By taking a personal interest in each one in the group, the conductor can encourage full participation. Timid ones may be assigned in ,ad-vanceto fead scriptures, or they may be given a jue</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">stio</span><span class="font12">n in advance to prepare for answering. All should strive to com</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ment</span><span class="font12"> in t</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">heir own word</span><span class="font12">s. By listening carefully to the comments, the conductor can determine if some are in need of personal assistance. He can use other experienced ones in the group to assist in giving such individual attention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> The Congregation Book </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Study i</span><span class="font12">s a blessing to us. It gives Us the opportunity to meet in small groups and receive more personal attention. Never should we view it as lesslmportant than other meeti</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ngs.</span><span class="font12"> Your Congregation Book Study conductor takes seriously his responsibility to use each study to strengthen your faith in Jehovah and build your appreciation for God’s spiritual provisions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">responsibilities all of us have as Christians. On Saturday afternoon, a four-part symposium will be featured that explains how we can all joyfully care for our responsibilities. Our young people have a responsibility to bear, and the Saturday afternoon talk by the circuit overseer will be especially directed to them. On Saturday there will also be an opportunity for newly dedicated ones to be baptized. All of those planning to be baptized at the circuit assembly should let the presiding overseer know well in advance so that preparation can be made for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> On Sunday morning another four-part symposium will focus in on our Christian responsibility to preach. Then, on Sunday afternoon, the public talk entitled “God’s New World</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">With Discernment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> An inspired proverb says: “He that is guarding discernment is going to find good.” (Prov. 19:8) The wisdom of these words has often proved true in our preaching a</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ctivity</span><span class="font12">. For example, by using discern</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ment and tac</span><span class="font12">t, many publishers have turned possible conv</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ersation stoppers into opport</span><span class="font12">unities to give a further witness. Or they&quot; have at least laid a foundation for a witness fo be given at a </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">late</span><span class="font12">r time. How can this be done?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HANDLING CONVERSATION STOPPERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Often we meet people who say, “I’m busy.” Is the householder truly busy,(oils he merely saying this so as not to~get involved in a lengthy discussion? Discernment is needed. IFhe does not seem really busy, we may try overcoming this conversation stopper. We could say,i“Then I will be brief .&quot;/Thereafter, wb can summarize what </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">we inte</span><span class="font12">nded to discuss, keeping in mind the agreement to limit our conversation. As a result of our conside</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ration and interes</span><span class="font12">t-arousing comments, the person may even indl-' cate a desire to continue the discussion right then.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Suppose the one you approach really is busy. Although we do not wanF’to be turned aside easily, If we are insistent or pushy, we may leave an unfavorable impression. If a householder comes to the door with a cooking utensil in her hand&quot; and we smell food beingprepared, very likely she is truly busy. So discernment and good judgmenf are needed. It would not be considerate to pe</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">rsist</span><span class="font12"> in the conversation at that time. How much better it would be to give the householder a tract .and suggest calling back later. This will leave a more favorable impression, and a fine witness may be given the next time a Witness calls.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">REACTING TO THE PERSON’S DISPOSITION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> On occasion we meet indivi</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">duals </span><span class="font12">who are abrupt when we call on them in the house-to-house ministry. What should we do in this event? Prpygrbs 17,:27 counsels: (“A man of discernment is cool of spirit.&quot; What fine advice! A mild voice expfessing concern often serves to relax, such a person. Moreover, if we can tactfully get him to express himself on an issue that concerns him, he may become less defensive. Even if he cuts short the conversation, possibly our mild </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">re</span><span class="font12">sponse will leave .him in a better frame of mind toward the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses. That would be a fine accomplishment. Of course, if a householder becomes upset and angry, it would be best toleave quietly and perhaps try witnessing to him at another time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Then there are persons who, although argumentative, may be sincere. In these circumstances, it might be a real test of our patience to continue the conversation with them. But if we are discerning, we will not necessarily conclude that a househol</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">der i</span><span class="font12">s not interested just because he strongly expresses a differingview. We may wish to ask tactful questions in an effort to find out </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">why he</span><span class="font12"> believes the way he does and then show him what the Bible says on the subject. (Prov. 20:5) Based on his reaction, we can decide if it would be advantageous to continue the conversation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> A discerning publisher realizes that time and circumstances often change a householder’s attitude toward the Kingdom message. His reaction may be quite different the next time we call. We must be careful not to assume we will get a negative response because of the way the householder reacted the last time we called at his door.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Deciding whether we.should pursue a conversation is not easy. Yet, </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">by dev</span><span class="font12">e</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">lopi</span><span class="font12">ng the art of te</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">achin</span><span class="font12">g, we will Become more effective in presenting the good news with discernment, while we </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">look to J</span><span class="font12">e</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span><span class="font12">o</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">vah t</span><span class="font12">o ble</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ss our efforts.</span><span class="font12">—1 Cor. 3:6; Titus 1:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">• Since we want to use our literature wisely, what adjustments might we make in offering literature in street witnessing?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">In doing street witnessing, it is appropriate to approach people with the magazines or publications in our hand. Our goal should be to try to have a conversation with people. In that way we can determine whether the person contacted is interested and will agree to read our magazines. If it is possible to discuss briefly one of the articles in a magazine, that would be ideal. It may also be possible to explain that our work is done by volunteers and is not a commercial business, but that it is a worldwide activity supported through voluntary contributions. In some instances, a publisher may have to walk along with the person while conversing about the contents and benefits of the magazine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">However, we should be discerning and considerate. Many of those we meet on the streets may be in such a rush that it would be hard for us to detect their interest. In such cases, it may be better simply to offer a tract to whet their appetite for more of our literature when they meet us again and can pause for a discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By being consistent in doing street work at certain locations and times, people will get acquainted with us and may be happy to discuss matters when they have opportunity, thereby giving us enough time to determine their interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We want to use our literature wisely. Therefore, we should endeavor to choose an appropriate time to offer literature. Our doing so will enable us to arrange to follow through on the interest and have time to explain the nature of our work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Turn Men From Darkness to Light</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Spiritual darkness covers the earth. (Isa. 60:2) Since mankind’s fall into sin, Satan, “the god of this system of things,” has kept people in spiritual darkness, and moral degradation has been the result.—2 Cor. 4:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Now that we have been enlightened by the truth, do we </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">feel pity f</span><span class="font12">or people as Jesus dici? (Matt. 9:36) If so, we will appreciate the significance of the commission he gave the apostle Paul to(‘o</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">pen people’s eye</span><span class="font12">s and turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God.Acts 26:16-18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ENLIGHTEN MINDS AND HEARTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Since Satan blinds the mind and desensitizes the heart of his victims, what can we do to help them? We need to </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">reach their mindpnt</span><span class="font12">p h</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">eart </span><span class="font12">with God’s Word. Paul prayed that' the Ephesians would have the eyes of their heart enlightened. (Eph. 1: 17, 18) Nothing is more powerful than Go</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">d’s Word</span><span class="font12"> for reaching the heart. (Heb. 4:12) Knowing this should motivate us to </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">develop skil</span><span class="font12">l in u</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">sing the Bibl</span><span class="font12">e when speaking with others.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> has helped millions to turn from darkness to light. It s</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">hows us how to apply</span><span class="font12"> the Bible’s moral principles, understand its prophecies for our day, and differentiate between true and false religion so as to walk in the way Jehovah approves.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> What has Bible truth as championed in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> produced?

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Deliverance From World Turmoil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 21:10, 11,26—Bible prophecy fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 21:28, 31 —God’s Kingdom will soon bring deliverance.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The inspired words of the Bible can have a powerful effect on people. For this reason, first-century Christians made good use of the Scriptures when proclaiming the good news. Paul ‘reasoned from the Scriptures,’ explaining and proving his points by references. (Acts 17:2, 3) Apollos, when witnessing to Jews, “demonstrated by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.”—Acts 18:24-28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s Witnesses today follow this example. As stated in the March 1, 1986, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font12">page 26: “When they share in the public ministry, they want people to realize that the message they proclaim is not of their own originality but is from God’s own Word. So they make direct use of the Bible, actually reading from it to others whenever possible.” Are you making full use of the Bible in your ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY EFFECTIVE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Why is the Bible so effective? Because it is the Word of God and “is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (Heb. 4:12) The true motives of individuals come to the fore when exposed to Scriptural truth. People of honest heart are drawn to it. For example, one young couple who made rapid progress in serving Jehovah were asked why they responded so quickly to the good news. Their answer? “It was the Bible.&quot; When the publishers who called on them directed their attention to the Bible, they recognized the voice of “the fine shepherd.”—John 10:14; w78 6/1 pp. 22-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Do you sometimes feel inadequate when using your Bible in field service? A good personal study program, including preparation for and attendance at all congregation meetings, will equip you for every good work and give you added confidence. (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) Service partners and family members can practice going over the Topic for Conversation with each other. Also, most of the introductions on pages 9-15 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book involve reading a scripture early in the conversation. Why not practice some of these? Use what is practical and catches the interest of the people in your territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">USE GOOD JUDGMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> There are times when we will want to invite the householder to get his own copy of the Bible and look up </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 3)</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Speaking of family members, 1 Timothy 5:4 states: “Let these learn first to practice godly devotion in their own household.” Indeed, the practice of godly devotion in our dealings with family members is something to be learned. In this we need divine guidance, since caring for family members is part of our Christian obligation. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font12"> can help us find guidance for a variety of circumstances that arise in family life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> A family comes into existence when a man and a woman wed. (Gen. 2:24) Are you seriously contemplating marriage? Under the heading “Marriage,” you will find the subheading “selecting a mate.” The references will direct you to helpful advice on this sometimes difficult endeavor. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font12"> also has subheadings for “husband’s role&quot; and “wife’s role,” each providing references to information that will benefit those desiring to marry and those already married. Additionally, subheadings such as “communication,” “closeness in,” and “peace” point to material that can enrich marriage. When difficulties arise, the subheading “problems in” can direct you to effective counsel on how to resolve these.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Children are an inheritance from Jehovah. (Ps. 127:3) How can parents bring up their children “in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah”?

The heading “Child Training” leads to perceptive discussions of every aspect of rearing children, including how to help them develop a personal relationship with Jehovah and form a longing for the truth.—1 Pet. 2:2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Prearranged family Bible discussions are essential to family success. (Deut. 6:6-9; Isa. 54:13; Eph. 5: 25, 26) References to ideas for holding enjoyable family discussions can be found under the heading “Families.&quot; In the current </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Index,</span><span class="font12"> the subheading “Bible study” has such subsubheadings as “making it effective,” “making it enjoyable,&quot; and “making it interesting.” Also, why not consider from time to time one of the life stories of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Under the heading “Full-Time Ministry,” you will be referred to life stories with such titles as “A Choice I’ve Never Regretted” and “Receiving the Requests of My Heart.” Still other such accounts are listed under “Missionaries.” A complete listing is found under “Life Stories of Jehovah's Witnesses.”</span></p></li>

<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Arrange Now to Attend the 1991 &quot;Lovers of Freedom&quot; District Convention</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> In view of world conditions today, it is no surprise that in many lands people long for greater freedom than they have. But where can real freedom be found? Jesus Christ said: '“If you remain in my word, you are really my disciples, and you will <sub>A </sub>know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (John 8:31,32) This freedom is not the limited kind' that men hope for when they reject one political ruler or form of government in favor of another. Instead, it gets right to the core of human problems. What Jesus was discussing was freedom from slavish bondage to sin. (See John 8:24,34-36.) Thus, when a person becomes a true disciple of Jesus Christ, it results in a noticeable change in his life, a liberation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> A THREE-DAY CONVENTION: </span><span class="font13">The series of 1991 “Lovers of Freedom” District Conventions will begin in the United States on June 74). The opening session will start at 10:</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">20 a.m</span><span class="font13">. on Friday, and the convention will conclude about 4^’cluck on Sunday afternoon. Carefully selected information vital to our spiritual health will be presented at every session. A variety of subjects will highlight how the freedom referred to at Romans 8:21 can be ours. Stirring information will be developed and presented in talks, demonstrations, interviews, and a drama.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Make it your resolve not to mis? even one session. This may require personal sacrifices and adjustments in your schedule. It may be necessary to make special arrangements with your employer. Many even forgo financial advantages in order to attend all sessions. Jehovah will certainly bless those who make the matter a subject of sincere prayer and put forth heartfelt effort to be there. —Luke 13:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> ARRIVE EARLY: </span><span class="font13">Jehovah’s Witnesses are known for their efforts to be dependable and punctual, (Luke 16:10) This is also important when attending the district convention. Arrive early each day, and be seated before the program b</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">egin</span><span class="font13">s. This will require allowing sufficient time to care for matters that need attention, such as parking your vehicle and finding seats for your family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Attending the district convention gives us a fine opportunity to enjoy pleasant association. But visiting with friends late into the night can hinder our efforts to be on time the next day. Much anxiety and frustration can result from getting a late start and thus having to rush in the morning. To prevent this, it is beneficial to set a reasonable time for retiring. By strictly adhering to a schedule, all are more likely to get a good night’s sleep and be ready for an early start the next day. This avoids the possibility of arriving while the program is in progress, which is distracting and may be an annoyance to those already seated. Arriving early each day will allow you to fellowship with your brothers and sisters. Christia</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">n loy</span><span class="font13">e and consjder-ation, along with respect for Jehovah and the spiritual things he is providing, should motivate us to do our best to arrive on time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> LISTEN INTENTLY: </span><span class="font13">Listening means really paying attention with both our mind and our heart, with our ears and our powers of understanding. We need to listen and “hear the word of Jehovah.” (Jer. 2:4) At Isaiah 55:2 Jehovah commanded Israel: “Listen intently to</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">me</span><span class="font13">.” The word “intent” is defined as “directed with strained or eager attention.” If we are attentive during the convention, we will eagerly “listen and take in more instruction.” (Prov. 1:5) To listen and learn at a district convention usually takes more e</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ffor</span><span class="font13">t and concentration than it does at the Kingdom Hall. Why? We are sitting for longer periods of time, and there are mor</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">e distraction</span><span class="font13">s because of the larger number of people in attendance. If we are not attentive, we will deprive ourselves and miss out on receiving the full benefit of the rich spiritual nourishment being provided. (1 Pet. 2:2) What can be done? It is so pleasing to observe that many convention delegates have been developing the useful habit of taking notes during the program. While some of the talks at the district convention will in time appear in the publications, others will not. All are encouraged to make it a goal to take brief n</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">otes</span><span class="font13"> during the district convention because that is a good way to_keep your attention riveted on what is being said.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Notes need not be extensive or elaborate. Usually a phrase or two will suffice for a key point. Even young children will get more from the talks and be helped to concentrate if they are provided with a notepad and pen or pencil so that they can write down the speakers’ key points and key scriptures or new thoughts that may be presented. Elders find it advantageous to have neatly arranged notes for conducting an interesting review of the convention program on the Service Meeting following the district convention. Also, they may wish to incorporate many of the points presented at the convention in their teaching and shepherding work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> BE UNITED IN SONG AND PRAYER: </span><span class="font13">Part of our worship involves honoring Jehovah by singing his praises, even as Jesus and his apostles did. (Mark 14:26) Paul’s statement at 1 Corinthians 14: 15 concerning singing appears to indicate that it was a regular feature, of Christian worship* (See also </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> of February 1991, page 7.) District conventions afford us a unique opportunity to be united with thousands of our brothers and sisters in praising Jehovah in both song and prayer. However, some have shown a lack of respect for these important parts of our worship. How? By unnecessarily arriving at the convention d</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">uring or after the opening son</span><span class="font13">g and prayer. At the conclusion of the program, s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ome leave t</span><span class="font13">he</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ir seat</span><span class="font13">s during t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">he song</span><span class="font13"> or before the prayer. On rare occasions there may be good reason for doing this. However, is proper respect and appreciation being shown for Jehovah’s </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">table</span><span class="font13"> if some give up the opportunity to sing and pray unitedly just so they can get an early start to t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">heir cars</span><span class="font13"> or_toueat? —Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Care must be exercised that in the pursuit of personal convenience, we do not allow the worldly </span><span class="font12">me-first attitude or ungodly traits such as greed </span><span class="font13">and selfishness, to hamper our spiritual progress. In recent years, many of our brothers and sisters in Eastern European countries were able at last to enjoy the freedom of singing and praying. Just as they were thrilled at being able to sing and pray in large numbers, so may we show the same spirit of appreciation for sacred things now and neve</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">r view </span><span class="font13">lig</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">htly our opportunities to</span><span class="font13"> singand praylogether.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> OUR CHRISTIAN MANNERS: </span><span class="font13">Our Christian manners and appearance at district conventions have continued to earn us a good reputation as Jehovah’s Witnesses. This is because we are serious in our worship of Jehovah and because we do not vie</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">w attending a</span><span class="font13"> convention-as-a-mere social outing. When coming together for such special occasions, we should maintain our Christi</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">an dign</span><span class="font13">ity and </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">a spiritual frame of mind by conducting </span><span class="font13">o</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">urselves as ministers</span><span class="font13"> a</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">t all time</span><span class="font13">s.—1 Cor. 10: 31-33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> If we fail to do this, we </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">affect the happiness of </span><span class="font13">others, everTst</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">umbling</span><span class="font13">-new ones. Do we acknowledge and express </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ap</span><span class="font13">p</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">reciati</span><span class="font13">on for even small kindn</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">esse</span><span class="font13">s shown us? We need to be aware of others around us and show respect and consideration. Everyone should appreciate that when the program is on, it is a ti</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">me to be listening</span><span class="font13">, not </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">walki</span><span class="font13">ng around or </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">talkin</span><span class="font13">g.—Deut. 31:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> Another area where our Christian manners can magnify Jehovah God is in our dealings with those wh</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">o pro</span><span class="font13">vide </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">us our p</span><span class="font13">laces-of lodging. We are acquiring good motel rooms at significantly, reduced rates. We should show appreciation and be considerate of moteLpersonnel, being courteous and not overly demanding. (Gal. 6:10) Good counsel has been given regarding proper conduct at motels. While most have responded favorably and are earnestly striving to cooperate fully with motel personnel, it is discouraging to note that a negative view toward Jehovah’s_Witnesses persists in some places, Why?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> While we may be concerned with saving money, we should not .kno</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">wingly neglect</span><span class="font13"> those who expect tips for services Rendered. The articles “To </span><span class="font12">Tip -Or Not” and “Tips on Tipping” on pages 2-1-7 </span><span class="font13">of the June 22,1986, issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> still deserve our attention. It was pointed out on page 244“Tip-ping is more than a thank-you for extra service rendered. It is the principal part of a.person’s income,</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;yAwake!</span><span class="font13"> also pointed out that when “attending a convention, what you do personally reflects, on the whole group. People will judge the group by your behavior.” -So regardless of your personal views about tipping, when you visit a city as a delegate to a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses, use good judgment and discernment, and be ready td “do all things for the sake of the good news.”—1 Cor. 9:19-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>14</sup> It is a matter of some concern to motel managers that some Witnesses have checked out of motels and left their rooms in an_unsightly condition. Cleanliness and consideration should be manifested not just in our dress and conduct but also in the way we t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">reat the property of othe</span><span class="font13">rs. Is there any reason why a rented room should not be left neat and clean? Do n</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ot waste ice</span><span class="font13"> provided by the motel or use motel ice machines to fill picniachests to take to the convention. This deprives other guests of their share. Inconsiderate behavior mars our good name. At the coming district conventions, all of us should make it our resolve to conduct ourselves so as to “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things.”—Titus 2:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> FOR PARENTS: </span><span class="font13">Young children and teenagers are welcome and expected to attend the “Lovers of Freedom” District Convention. The freedom that the world offers can lead to their spiritual death, just as Adam lost the freedom given to mankind at the start. Jehovah’s loving organization has provided all of us with the correct reasoning on this matter. We are encouraged to see young ones who have learned to </span><span class="font12">pay close attention at all Christian meetings and </span><span class="font13">who are intently interested in the convention program. (Ps. 148:12, 13) But much depends on the example and supervision of the parents. Many young ones have been well trained to take notes. If you have not as yet taught your children how to take notes, why not use the time remaining before your convention to do so? Even the very young can be encouraged to write down scripture citations and related key words they hear expressed by the speakers. Some parents arrange to revi</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ew main poin</span><span class="font13">ts from the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">day’s program</span><span class="font13"> after returning to their place of lodging or while traveling home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>16</sup> Of course, most parents understand that the natural in</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">clinat</span><span class="font13">ion of children is to be p</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">layful. </span><span class="font13">They lack experience, in life, and they are' immature. Therefore, they have to be taught when to pay attention and how to co</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nduc</span><span class="font13">t themselves at meetings. This calls for good supervision by their parents. Some parents have been lax in this area. At times, although parents may be showing proper reverence to Jehovah during a prayer, their children are playing and distracting others. Parents should know what their children are doing even during prayers. Also, what are they doing when they leave their seats during the program? Are children left unsupervised during or after the convention program?—Prov. 29:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>17</sup> In so</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">me cas</span><span class="font13">es children have been left unsupervised in motel swimming pools while the parents are in the room, out to dinner, or involved in some other activity. This is not p</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">roper.</span><span class="font13"> Some children have acted in an undisciplined and unruly manner and have ev</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">en been disrespectfu</span><span class="font13">l to older brothers and sisters who have tried to correct them in a kindly way. Such unruliness and conduct unbefitting Christians is often the result of permissiveness and a lack of discipline in the home. It should certainly be corrected. All Christian parents should give close supervision to their children at all times as they taring “them up in the dis</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">cipli</span><span class="font13">ne and mental-regulating of Jehovah.”—Eph. 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> YOUR FULL COOPERATION IS APPRECIAT</span><span class="font13">ED: Considerable planning and work have been done to see that sufficient seating, literature, food, and other provisions are available for everyone attending the convention. To ensure the effectiveness of these arrangements, each congregation has been speci</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">fically assigned to a particular</span><span class="font13"> convention. Your full cooperation is vital in order to prevent overcrowding. Of course, there may be circumstances that make it necessary for a few to attend a convention in another area. However, most should be able to attend the convention at their assigned location.—1 Cor. 13:5; Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>19</sup> Your full cooperation is requested in the matter of saving seats. Please keep in mind that SEATS MAY BE SAVED ONLY FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE </span><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">family</span><span class="font13"> MEMBERS AND ANY WHO MAY BE TRAVELING WITH YOU IN YOUR OWN CAR. Please do not reserve seats for others. At times, extra seats are reserved for no one jji particular. This is unloving and is misleading to the attendants and others looking for available seats. In harmony with the Bible counsel, we should strive to display brotherly affection and cooperate fully with the approved arrangement for saving seats. No one is entitled to more seats than required for his immediate family or car group. —2 Pet. 1:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>20</sup> No overnight seat saving is allowed. At no time will any convention facility be opened before 7:00 a.m. to anyone other than the volunteer workers on duty prior to that time. None of these workers will be allowed to save seats until after 7:00 a.m., when others are allowed to enter the building. The attendants will be in their assigned locations prior to that time to monitor what is being done, so as to avoid abuses of the Society’s seat-saving guidelines. Please cooperate fully with the attendants as they fulfill their assignment for the benefit of all in attendance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>21</sup> It is suggested that good judgment be used in bringing personal items to the convention site. In the past, some have brought large coolers or other bulky items that could not be placed under their seats. These were placed in the aisle or on seats. This deprived others of a seat, and sometimes it violated fire and safety codes. We need to show consideration in such matters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>22</sup> As was done last year, the Society will make all food items available at no charge to those attending the convention. What fine provisions these are, making the work lighter and much faster for the benefit of everyone! No doubt such generosity on the part of God’s organization will move us with gratitude to express our appreciation in practical ways. (Prov. 11:25) Please be careful not </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">to waste </span><span class="font13">food or other convention provisions. At conventions this past year, whole sandwiches and halffilled soda cans were found in the trash receptacles. This is an abuse of the g</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">enerosity</span><span class="font13"> that has been shown and a violation of Scriptural principles. —John 6:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">“Certainly, Jehovah’s people appreciate being able to meet together at fine facilities in order to benefit from the spiritual program prepared. We also appreciate the many services and conveniences provided at such gatherings. With much care and at considerable expense to the Society, arrangements are made for adequate seating, installing expensive sound systems, operating an efficient Food Service Department, and handling a number of other arrangements and services that make attending the convention enjoyable and spiritually refreshing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>24</sup> Expenses for these are covered by your volun? tary contributions and support of the Society’s worldwide work. If you choose to write a check, it can be made payable to “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” For your convenience, clearly marked contribution boxes will be located throughout the convention facility. All contributions are very much appreciated, and the Society wishes to thank you in advance for your generous and unified support of Kingdom interests in this way. One individual expressed appreciation that the amount of contribution is not suggested: ‘It seems so appealing to know that it is left up to<sup>1</sup> us—up to the depth of our own appreciation. So it is with gratitude that we feel impelled to offer more than usual.’ jWe are confident that all will be moved to sense their individual responsibility regarding these expenses and will cooperate fully by sharing to the extent their circumstances allow.—Luke 6:38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> BE PRESENT AT THE “LOVERS OF FREEDOM” DISTRICT CONVENTION! </span><span class="font13">By attending the “Lovers of Freedom” District Convention and paying close attention to the program, we will enhance our appreciation for the freedom that comes through Christ and for the proper use of Christian freedom. Make your plans now to be on hand for the opening song and to attend all sessions until the concluding prayer on Sunday afternoon.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>District Convention Reminders</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING: </span><span class="font12">Your cooperation in using the listing of accommodations provided by the convention is very much appreciated. If you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city and have not already confirmed a reservation, please do so immediately. If you find it necessary to cancel your reservation, you should write or phone the motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible so that the room can be made available to someone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Congregation secretaries should be sure that Special Needs Room Request forms have been promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should immediately notify both the landlord or motel and the convention Rooming Department so that the room can be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BABY STROLLERS: </span><span class="font12">In many locations, baby strollers may not be used in places of public assembly. Fire regulations prohibit parking them in corridors, aisles, or between rows of seats. Since larger crowds may cause congested conditions, baby strollers are potentially dangerous not only to the baby but also to any who may stumble over them. So please do not bring them to the convention site. However, infant or car seats are permissible, since these can be secured in seats next to the parents. Your cooperation in this matter will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BAPTISM: </span><span class="font12">Baptismal candidates should endeavor to be in their seats in the designated section before the program begins on Saturday morning. A modest bathing suit and a towel should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized. After the baptism talk and prayer by the speaker, the session chairman will give brief instructions to baptismal candidates and then call for a song. Beginning with the last verse, the attendants will direct the baptismal candidates to the immersion site or to vehicles that will take them there, while the rest of the audience completes the singing of the song. Since baptism in symbol of one’s dedication is an intimate and personal matter between the individual and Jehovah, there is no provision for so-called partner baptisms in which two or more baptismal candidates embrace or hold hands while being baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font12">Volunteer help is needed for the smooth operation of a district convention. Even if you may be able to work for only a part of the convention, your services will be appreciated. If you can assist, please report to the Volunteer Service Department when you arrive at the convention. Children under l6 years of age can also contribute to the success of the convention, but they are required to work with. a. parent or other responsible adult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BADGE CARDS: </span><span class="font12">Please </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">wear</span><span class="font12"> the specially designed badge card at the convention and while traveling to and from the convention site. This often makes it possible for us to give a fine witness while traveling. Being identified as a convention delegate by a clearly inscribed badge card will facilitate the operation of the simplified food service arrangement. Badge cards should be obtained through your congregation, as they will </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font12">.be.available at the conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WORDS OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font12">Regardless of where you park, you should lock your yellicle at alltimes and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font12"> leave anything visible inside, keep your belongings locked inside the trunk if possible. Also, guard against thieves and pickpockets, who are attracted by large gatherings. This includes not leaving anything of value unattended on seats at the conventions. Please be careful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It has been reported that some motels provide easy access to television movies with immoral content or even of pornographic nature. This highlights the need to avoid unsupervised TV watching by children at these places of lodging.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Assisting Others While in Field Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> From its beginning, the Christian congregation has been an organization of evangelizers. Jesus personally trained his disciples in the preaching activity and “initiated sending them outtwo by two.” (Mark 6:7; Luke 8:1) The apostle Paul made mention of his “fellow workers” in the Philippian congregation who had ‘striven side by side with him in the good news.’ (Phil. 4:3) Although it is not always necessary to have a partner in the ministry, most of us appreciate being accompanied by others. (Eccl. 4:9) How, then, can we be encouraging and helpful to one another as we preach?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> One of the purposes of our meetings for field service is to give assistance to ne_w.gr and less experienced publishers, (om pp. 77,97) Even newly appointed pioneers may want to work with more experienced publishers or with an elder or a ministerial servant. What a fine opportunity for “an interchange of encouragement&quot;! —Rom. 1:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> For safety reasonsjt may be advisable for publisherslo work-together in some areas. Or at times it may be necessary to alter preyious plans to work with someone so as to accommodate the less experienced publishers who are at the meeting for service. If we are called upon to do so, it would indeed be the course of love for us to make any needed, adjustments in order I</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">gQassis</span><span class="font12">t those who are weak,’? even though we may customarily work with </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">a certain compan</span><span class="font12">ion. —Acts 20:35.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WORK HARMONIOUSLY</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Question Box</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">• Why is it recommended that publishers serve with the congregation that holds the territory where they live?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is important to do things in an orderly and theocratic way. The apostle Paul wrote: “For God is a God, not of disorder, but of peace. . . . Let all things take place decently and by arrangement.&quot;—1 Cor. 14: 33, 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While there may be some exceptions because of transportation difficulties, secular work schedules, or the need for assistance in oversight, generally it is best to attend the congregation in whose territory we live. This makes field service more convenient, and we do not have to travel so far to work with a group outside our neighborhood. It puts us in a better position to work with others in our in field service, we want to work harmoniously as a team. (Compare 1 Corinthians 3:6, 9.) Both can share in giving the witness, perhaps taking turns initiating conversations at the doors. Good manners would dictate that we listen politely Aniattentively while nur partner is talking.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Although it may be appropriate at times to join in the discussion when our partner is taking the lead, this requires goodjudgment. We do not want to interrupt a line of reasoning being used to good effect with the householder. Of course, if a less </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ex</span><span class="font12">perienced publisher begins to experience difficulty handling an objection, no doubt </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">he would appre</span><span class="font12">ciate well-directed assistance.—Eccl. 4:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> We can make good use of the time between doors to discuss ways our presentation might be improved. Perhaps using one of the introductions in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book or a suggestion outlined in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> would prove more effective.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Our ministry is indeed a highly value</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">d treasu</span><span class="font12">re. (2 Cor. 4:1, 7) As we have opportunity to work with others in the field service, we can build in pne another a deep appreciation for our sacred, work.

<p><span class="font12">congregation and to direct newly interested ones to the meetings most convenient to them. And it keeps us in close touch with other brothers and sisters in our area who can help us in time of need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By working submissively within the arrangements made, we show that we are keeping Kingdom interests first. (Luke 16:10) When a new congregation is formed or Congregation Book Studies are rearranged, we may prefer to stay with certain friends. But by accepting the new arrangement, we can make new friends and widen out in our theocratic associations. Also, i</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">t is easier </span><span class="font12">for </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">the elders to shepherd the flnnk </span><span class="font12">and improve the spiritual condition of the congregation when publishers live within the territory of the congregation with which they associate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS _________________________________________________________________________&gt;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font12">since people in some areas may be apprehensive about unexpected visitors coming in the evening, we want to Tie warm and friendly in our introductions and be quick to make clear the purpose of our visit. If we can convey genuine concern for the welfare of the householders, they will more likely feel at ease and may be more inclined to express themselves openly.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> In some places, householders have taken </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">measures to guard thei</span><span class="font12">r security. This may require our using an infercom, or the householder may talk to us through a closed door or want to see us through a pee</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">phole</span><span class="font12"> in the door. By our respecting the arrangements the householder has, he may be more agreeable to listening to the truths we want to share with him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Many congregations have scheduled group witnessing one or more evenings during the week. This has given publishers who have full-time secular employment greater opportunity to share in the ministry and even work with some publishers they have never worked with before because of conflicting work schedules. Evening witnessing has made it possible for some publishers to increase the amount of </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">time</span><span class="font12"> they spend in the field ministry, and this, in turn, has led to their becoming more p</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">roficie</span><span class="font12">nt in sharing the good news with others. Also, many Bible studies have been started as a result ofcontacting individuals who have not listened to Jehovah’s Witnesses before.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Might it </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">be possib</span><span class="font12">le, for, .you to share'in evening witnessing and enjoy this added opportunity to “do the work of an evangelizer”? (2 Tim. 4:5) If more of us are able to answer that question positively, perhaps we too will be doing a better job of filling our territory with the truth.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> During this second month of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> subscription campaign, we need to search </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">out opportunitie</span><span class="font12">s to turn men from darkness to light.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">During Evening Hours</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Some of the early disciples of Jesus Christ were told by the Jewish high priest, “You have filled Jerusalem with your teaching.&quot; (Ac|s_5^8J The brothers obvio</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">usly had gone a </span><span class="font12">fine job of witnessing in that city, and doubtless they worked dili</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">gently</span><span class="font12"> to contact everyone in their territory. They continued to give a thorough witness there and elsewhere.—Acts 8:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In many areas today, we have filled our territory with the teaching of the truth. There has been an excellent increase in publishers arid a corresponding<sup>-</sup>increase in the number of congregations. Territories have gotten smaller and are being covered more frequently. It has become necessary for us to expand our territory in order to reach more people with the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEFITS OF EVENING WITNESSING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Many publishers have found they can, in effect, expand their territory by calling at homes during evening hours. At that time they are able to contact many householders who are usual</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ly not at home in</span><span class="font12"> the daytime. Publishers have reported finding someone in almost every home in their territory when they call in the evening. Not only are more people at home but those found are usually in a more relaxed mood and willing^ to listen to our message. Circuit overseers have been able to help many congregations organize evening witnessing arrangements. All publishers are encouraged to support this regular Wednesday evening feature during the visit of the circuit overseer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">* Have you. tried witnessing during evening hours in your territory? With the sun setting later in the summertime, we have the opportunity to stay out somewhat longer than we might otherwise. A part of the evening can be used for house-to-housewitnessing or calling on not-atr. homes. Then perhaps later in the evening, we can make return visits or conduct a Bible study. Even when<sup>-</sup>daylight hours are more limited later on in the year, we may be able to use early evening hours for house-to-house witnessing. Of course, we need to use the spirit of a sound mind and show discretion, especially when witnessing in areas where it may not be safe after dark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BE CONSIDERATE</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> To be successful in evening witnessing, we need to keep in mind some basic points. For example,</span></p>

When brevity is required, we may decide to read just one of the texts in our Topic for Conversation. Or if the householder is obviously busy, we may simply quote an appropriate phrase, letting the householder know that it is from the Bible. Jesus and the apostles did not have personal copies of the Hebrew Scriptures to carry with them when preaching. Yet they quoted extensively from them. We too should make an effort to memorize scriptures so that we have them in mind for use in our ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Paul exhorted Timothy to ‘handle the word of the truth aright.’ (2 Tim. 2:15) The same admonition applies to us today. We want to imitate Jesus and the apostles by making frequent use of the Bible in our field ministry. Read from it whenever possible, but if necessary, quote it from memory. Our doing this effectively will make it clear that we are God’s ministers and that our message is based solidly on his Word.</span></p>

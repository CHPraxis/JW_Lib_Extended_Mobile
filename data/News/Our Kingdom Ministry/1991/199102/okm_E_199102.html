<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Kingdom—The Hope for Mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 6:10—We pray for the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Dan. 2:44—What it will do.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Boldly Extend the Invitation to “Comer</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> Fast-moving events worldwide identify these times as “the last days.” (2 Tim. 3:1-5) The rise in crime, economic instability, and lifethreatening diseases have added their pressure. But happily, in the face of such woes, people are being extended an invitation that could affect them everlastingly. The spirit and the bride continue to say: “Come!” And now “a great crowd” have joined them in extending an open invitation to people everywhere to come and take life’s water free. —Rev. 7:9; 22:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Today, those thirsting for righteousness are responding to this invitation in great numbers. Last year millions attended the district conventions held worldwide, and almost ten million were present at the Memorial. Millions of others are showing appreciation for Jehovah’s provision by listening to the Kingdom message. How important, then, that we use our time wisely in extending this invitation publicly and from house to house! —Acts 5:42; Eph. 5:15,16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BOLDLY PARTICIPATE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> The early Christians were persecuted because of their zealous preaching. (Acts 16:19-21; 17:2-8) However, they did not let up in their bold efforts to announce the good news. We likewise must be bold and determined in our efforts to get the good news preached.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> Even in countries where the work is under ban, the brothers are sharing wholeheartedly in the preaching work despite severe persecution, including the possible loss of jobs, homes, and even their freedom. Their fine example serves to encourage us to continue inviting others to “Come!” —2 Thess. 3:9.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Fulfilling Our Kingdom Ministry as Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> As Jehovah’s Witnesses we have the greatest privilege on earth. We represent Jehovah in a universal court case that puts on trial all of those worshiped as gods. (Isa. 41: 1, 23; 43:12) To help us make a worthy defense of our hope, Jehovah has provided a well-stocked library of publications. (I Pet. 3:15) The </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Watch Tower Publications Index</span><span class="font16"> is an important key to finding the information we need. Familiarity with some of its principal features will help us become more skilled in its use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> All of us should be well acquaint-edjvith the main heading “Jehovah.” Under that heading in the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">1986-1989 Index,</span><span class="font16"> can you find references explaining Jehovah’s tempor</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">ary pe</span><span class="font16">rmission of what is bad? Also, you will find the centefecTheading “Name” in both the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">1.930-1985 Index</span><span class="font16"> and the cur</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> For more than 35 years after learning the truth, one sister maintained the heart desire to pioneer. Her personal circumstances changed when she was 70 years old, and she became a regular pioneer. Although few people at that age would undertake a new career, she did so. Having enjoyed the full-time ministry now for a number of years, she says, “It gets better every day.” She has brought spiritual refreshment to others because of fearlessly accepting Jehovah’s invitation to reach out and share more fully in Kingdom service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> As in the first century, people today are responding to this invitation, transforming their thinking, making over their minds, and giving up Goddishonoring practices. They become part of a dedicated international brotherhood of Witnesses and join with the spirit and the bride in saying “Come!” to yet other honesthearted people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>7</sup> The vast increase in the Kingdom work and the expansion of branch offices in various lands give evidence of Jehovah’s blessing. But time is running out for this old system. Now is the opportune time to demonstrate boldness and zeal in extending the invitation to “Come!” so that others may respond quickly and act upon what is heard.—Acts 20:26,27; Rom. 12:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">rent </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Index.</span><span class="font16"> References to everything published about the name Jehovah are collected here.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Another heading of major importance is “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” It brings together references about Jehovah’s Witnesses as an organization. Do you know what our </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">official </span><span class="font16">view is on advanced educ</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">ation</span><span class="font16">, autopsies, lulling in self-defense, or public welfare assistance? You will find references for such questions tinder the subhe</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">ading “att</span><span class="font16">itude toward—.” Further along are listed modern histories of Jehovah’s Witnesses in various countries, and an extensive list of comments about Jehovah’s Witnesses is found under the centered heading “Statements by Others.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Praising Jehovah in Song</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> Please open your songbook to the back endsheet. What do you see? A chorus of Levite singers at Jehovah’s holy temple, their mouths opened wide, singing with enthusiasm. Singing was an important feature of true worship at Jehovah’s temple. During the time of King David, more than 10 percent of those serving at the temple were assigned to praise Jehovah with music. And of that number, 288 were trained singers, “all experts.” You can be sure they took their singing seriously.—1 Chron. 23:3, 5; 25:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Coming to Christian times, we learn that Jesus and his apostles sang a song at the end of the Lord’s Evening Meal. (Mark 14:26) And the apostle Paul repeatedly tells us to sing praises to our God. At Colos-sians 3:16 he wrote: “Let the word of the Christ reside in you richly in all wisdom. Keep on teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, praises to God, spiritual songs with graciousness, singing in your hearts to Jehovah.”—See also Ephesians 5:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Singing Kingdom songs is one of the ways in which we praise Jehovah. Should we not therefore sing with all our hearts? When we do, we give praise to Jehovah. He listens to our songs that are directed to him even as he does to our prayers. When we really sing out, we can also bring joy to others, and we are benefited ourselves.</span></p></li>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">• When a publisher moves to another area, what should be done to assist in the transfer to a new congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As soon as a publisher arrives from another congregation, the congregation secretary should obtain from the publisher the name of his former congregation and the name and address of the secretary of that congregation. He should then write to the secretary of the former congregation, requesting the Congregation's Publisher Record card and a letter of introduction. The secretary receiving this request should respond without delay.—See </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry, </span><span class="font16">pages 104-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The publisher who plans to move can help by making sure that he has the correct name of the congregation he is leaving and the name and words of our songs. These are indeed an aid toward our “teaching and admonishing one another.” What fine counsel our songs contain! By taking that counsel seriously, we can be helped to cultivate the fruitage of the spirit, so as to abound in these and guard against the intrusion of fleshly, worldly influences. ‘Singing in our hearts’ encourages us to serve Jehovah boldly and cheerfully.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> To get the singing off to a fine start at the meetings, the chairman could announce not only the number of the song but also its theme, or title. He might occasionally note the Scriptural basis for the song and comment briefly on how it fits in with the information being presented.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> The </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Melodies</span><span class="font16"> and also the piano cassettes of our songs are fine instruments for helping our families to get better acquainted with the songs. Playing these as background music is a most enjoyable way foj us to become more familiar with our songs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>7</sup> The Scriptures repeatedly remind us of the obligation to praise our loving heavenly Father with song. Let us do so whole-souled. Thereby we can give a heartwarming witness to the stranger who comes into our midst. Yes, let us sing and make melody to Jehovah, even as David of old did.—Ps. 108: address of the secretary. Then, upon his arrival in the new congregation, this information can be given to the secretary there so that he can follow through promptly. Field service reports submitted to the new congregation can be held until the record card is received. Thereafter the publisher’s activity can be posted on the record card and included in the congregation's next monthly report.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">In some cases the publisher may already know the name and address of the secretary in the congregation to which he is moving. If so, there would be no need for the elders to wait for a request. The record of the publisher’s activity and a letter of introduction can be mailed immediately to the secretary of the congregation where the publisher will associate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS '</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By Street Witnessing</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> Proverbs 1:20 says: “True wisdom itself keeps'crying aloud in the very street. In the public squares it keeps giving forth its voice.&quot; These words are especially true today as Jehovah’s servants zealously preach the good news of the Kingdom wherever they can find people. Like Jesus and preChristian prophets, our genuine love for people moves us to present The truth to everyone, everywhere.—Jer. 11:6; Mark 6:56; Luke 13:22, 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Although a person's home is usually the most desirable place to speak to him about the truth, not many people are at home when we make house-to-house calls. When householders are home, often it is the same person we spoke to before that answers the door, and other members of the family are not contacted. Thus, street witnessing should have a definite place in our ministry. You may find that street witnessing is, as one pioneer expressed it, ' “an exciting, fresh, anffat-home terri-tory.-J</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A WARM POSITIVE ATTITUDE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Why not try doing your street witnessing in the same area on a regular basis? On</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">e si</span><span class="font16">ster who does this says that she has become acquainted with most of the shopkeepers and other people who are frequently on “her” street. A good rapport has developed, which has opened the way for many productive Bible discussions. An auxiliary pione.er who thoroughly enjoys street witnessing said that he tries to approach window-shoppers, people sitting in their cars, people waiting for buses, and even those who have said no on previous occasions. Courage and good judgment are needed&quot;so that we are bold and persuasive, yet not overly persistent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> The key to effective street witnessing is toTlave a warm, cheerful, and sincere approach. Smile. Catch the person’s eye if you can, but if not, go ahead and make a friendly approach. Observe the circumstances, and make use of them. One sister observes women laden with grocery bags and says, “I see you have been food shopping. It certainly is expensive these days. How about some encouraging food for the mind and heart? I enjoyed this article .. . .” To someone with children, she says, “I see you have two lovely children. Did you know that the Bible says children are a blessing from God? Here, let me show you....” Approaching a person deep in thought, she says, “I see you are thinking about something. The world is so full of trouble today, don’t you agree? Do you think a time will ever come when ... ?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> If a person is rushing down the street, you may just hand him a tract with the comment<sub>K</sub>“Here is some good news for you to read when you have time.” If people do not seem to be rushed, offer the magazines, and ex-plainthe donation arrangement. It is good to get the literature into the hands of people whenever possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> Many publishers who were at first nervous about street witnessing now view it as their favorite formof preaching. Of course, caufion must be exercised when working in dangerous areas or at times when it is unsafe. Even in small towns, there are usually busy areas, public'transportation centers, or public parking lots where people can be approached with the good news. Seize the opportunity, and with wisdom let your voice give forth the good news in the streets and public squares, to the blessing of the hearers and to the honor of Jehovah.—Prov. 1:20.</span></p></li></ul>

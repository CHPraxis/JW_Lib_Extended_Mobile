<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Most Important Day in 1991</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The most important date on our calendar this year is Saturday, March 30. After sundown on that day, we will celebrate the Memorial of Jesus’ death. (1 Cor. 11:20, 24) Why was the date of Jesus’ death made a day for special remembrance?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MEMORIAL—ITS SIGNIFICANCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Jesus’ death was an event of universal importance. When writing to members of the spirit-begotten Christian congregation, the apostle Paul said: “As often as you eat this loaf and drink this cup, you keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he arrives.” (1 Cor. 11:26) So the Memorial calls special attention to the significance of the death of Jesus Christ in the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose. It highlights the meaning of Jesus’ sacrificial death, particularly in relation to the new covenant and to the way his death affects those who will be his joint heirs in the heavenly Kingdom. —John 14:2, 3; Heb. 9:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> By maintaining integrity down till his death, Jesus sanctified his Father’s name and demonstrated that a perfect man could prove faithful to God under every kind of trial that Satan might bring against him. His death also provided the perfect human sacrifice needed to ransom Adam’s offspring and made it possible for as many as would exercise faith to live forever in a paradise</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Progress in the Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> There is an old adage about progress that says: “Begin where you are. But don’t stay where you are.” How applicable that saying is to making progress in the ministry! When you started in the ministry, you may only have been able to make a brief presentation of the Kingdom message. But if a few years have passed and you have not moved beyond that stage, having stayed where you were, what can you do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> ThetBrst step&gt;is to ask Jehovah for the wisdom needed fotea’ch with s</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">kill, (Pro</span><span class="font13">v.15:14; Jas. 1:5) The'sec-'</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">Ofid [stea</span><span class="font13">ls to work in_ha</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">rmon</span><span class="font13">y with ySurprayer. Set aside some time to go over presentations in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font13">book. Find one that </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">you feel</span><span class="font13"> you can effectively </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">use,</span><span class="font13"> and go over and over the presentation uritjLyou. have it clearly in mind. Thet^hird step is to </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">accompan</span><span class="font13">y ynur h</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">rotm*rs~nrtfie fi</span><span class="font13">eld so that you can make the presentation you have prepared.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FRIENDS TO HELP YOU</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> You may be saying, ‘That is easier said than done.’ True, but that is why earth. Because of all that would be accomplished by means of Jesus’ death, it was most fitting for him to instruct his disciples to memorialize his death.—rs pp. 266-7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW WE CAN SHOW APPRECIATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The world has many celebrations during the year, and much is done to promote them. On the other hand, the Lord’s Evening Meal is the only celebration that Jesus’ devoted footstep followers were commanded to observe. Without question, it is the year’s greatest celebration for all true Christians. Should not the profound significance of the commemorative Lord’s Evening Meal move us to focus attention on it during March?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Perhaps we could take a few minutes each week during March to discuss with our Bible students the scriptures that highlight the significance of Christ’s death and show them the basis for the Memorial. We could also encourage them to follow closely the Memorial Bible reading for March 25-30, as noted on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">1991 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span><span class="font13"> This can help deepen their appreciation for the Lord’s Evening Meal.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>G</sup> Since the Memorial celebration falls on a Saturday, it will be easier for many to schedule their affairs to attend. Many publishers are taking advantage of the fact that there are </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font13"> 4, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">col. S) </span><span class="font13">you have friends to help you. If yqu are young, talk with your parents or with experiencedjjublisljers who are productive ministers. Ask them for suggestion? on hqw to converse_with people at the doors. They may suggest practice sessions where you can fry your presentation. They can play the part of a householder, raising common objections encountered at the doors. </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">WitK practic</span><span class="font13">e y</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ou can </span><span class="font13">learn to converse skillfully with people.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> You have other friends who can help you. There are pioneers who have learned preaching techniques through experience and </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">by att</span><span class="font13">ending the Pioneer Service School. Your book study conductor or the service overseer may also be in a position to work with you from door to door and further demonstrate how to talk and reason with people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOLLOWING UP THE INTEREST SHOWN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> We are interested in giving further spiritual assistance to people who accept our literature. That</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">WEEK STARTING MARCH 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">5 min: Local announcements and selected Announcements from </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font13"> Outline field service arrangements for this weekend. 25 min: “Our Simplified Literature Distribution Arrangement.” Qualified elder considers material in article' with audience. Elder may also incorporate points from Society’s letterof April 21, 1990. Then have a well-prepared, experienced publisher demonstrate how information from talk can be applied in the field service. Using one of the current magazines that will be offered in field service this weekend, publisher engages householder in conversation on subject of one of the articles. As publisher calls attention to specific point in the magazine, householder says: “That looks interesting.” Publisher says: “I would be happy to leave the magazine with you so that you could enjoy reading this article as well as all the others in the magazine.” Householder asks: “How much is it?” Publisher replies: “If you will read it, there is no charge. You can see here on the publishers’ page that this magazine is part of a worldwide Bible educational work and is supported by voluntary donations. (Refer to statement on page 4 of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> and in lower right-hand column of page 2 of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.] I </span><span class="font13">am just one of more than four million Jehovah’s Witnesses who have volunteered their time and resources to accomplish this vital work in over two hundred lands. If others wish to make a small donation toward the work, they are welcome to do so.” Householder donates and publisher puts money in envelope he carries for that purpose. He expresses appreciation for donation offered and says he will stop by with next issues of the magazines. In a second brief demonstration, illustrate how publisher does not leave a publication because householder, although willing to talk, is not really interested in the Kingdom message. In third brief demonstration, show how a tract may be left with someone who displays genuine interest but is quite busy at the moment and it does not appear to be appropriate at that particular time to explain how our worldwide work is supported. Publisher promises to return at a more convenient time. When he calls again, he will endeavor to determine if the householder is really interested in our work and, if so, explain the nature of our ministry and how the work is supported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: “Presenting the Good News —With the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font13"> Book.” Question-and-answer discussion. After discussing paragraph 4, present well-prepared demonstration showing how publisher offers book to householder who has manifested genuine interest in the Bible discussion. Publisher migh</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">t say</span><span class="font13"> f “Jehovah’s Witnesses are volunteer workers who feel that it is vital for God-fearing people to have access to this good news that is expressed so interestingly in the Bible book of Revelation. The voluntary donations of Jehovah’s Witnesses and other people who see the value of Bible education today help to support this work and make it possible for us to offer this book without charge to individuals who genuinely are interested in learning what God has in store for mankind today.” Householder asks: “Do you mean I can have this book?&quot; Publisher replies: “Yes, you can if you really are interested in the Bible's message it contains. And I will be pleased to call again and discuss some of this information further with you. If you wish to make a small donation toward the advancement of this Bible educational work, you may do so. Your donation will be appreciated and used entirely for the advancement of the Kingdom good news.” Householder offers a donation and says he would welcome a return visit. In a second demonstration, start with final part of publisher’s explanation of literature distribution arrangement, and then have householder say: “I would very much like to read the book.” Publisher says: “I know you will find it exciting and perhaps even be surprised at some of the things that were written long ago about our times. I would like to discuss some of this information further with you at another time. Would it be convenient for you if I stop by at about this same time next week when we will be making other calls in this neighborhood?” Householder agrees and publisher leaves. Point out that some of the younger publishers may need to work more closely with their parents in the house-to-house ministry until they become adept at conversing with householders. New and less experienced publishers will want to work with publishers who can teach them how to use the Topic for Conversation and then explain effectively the simplified literature distribution arrangement. By carrying on the ministry in this way, more emphasis is being put on the actual preaching work and we are able to discern more clearly where genuine interest is being manifested. Our principal concern is to locate and feed the Lord’s sheep and help equip them for survival into Jehovah’s new world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">20 min: “The Most Important Day in 1991.” Questions and answers. Warm and enthusiastic presentation encouraging the congregation to get the spirit of the most important day of the year.

Experiences in presenting current offer could be related. Encourage auxiliary pioneer activity for April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">20 min: Prepare Effective Introductions. Elder who is effective in field ministry helps publishers prepare introductions that would be appropriate for local territory. Base suggestions on pages 9-15 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book. Discuss two or three introductions that may be used with current Topic for Conversation or other timely subject. Have experienced publishers demonstrate two house-to-house presentations, using suggestions given on Service Meeting for week starting March 4. As time allows, briefly relate local experiences that illustrate value of introductions that capture interest of householder.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Simplified Literature Distribution Arrangement</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The simplified arrangement of distributing literature without charge has now been in effect for one year. Has this arrangement proved successful? Field service reports reveal increased placements in all categories. Literally millions of persons are being given the opportunity to “conie ■ • • t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ake life’s water free</span><span class="font13">.’’—Rev. 22:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> However, we are not obligated, nor is it our desire, to hand out literature indiscriminately to just any person who will accept it. Just as we </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">wisely use</span><span class="font13"> b'</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">uf jwp material</span><span class="font13"> goods, e'ach publisher has the responsibility to make wise use of the literature he or she receives without charge from the Society through the local congregation. That the Society makes i</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ts lit</span><span class="font13">erature available to publishers without charge certainly does </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">not mean </span><span class="font13">that no cost is incurred In its production and distribution. All should especially appreciate the value of our literature in helping honesthearted persons in their quest for accurate knowledge concerning Jehovah God and his Son Jesus Christ. —John 17:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> How is the Society able to provide its literature to all without charge? The unavoidable costs incurred in its production and distribution are cared for </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">by donation</span><span class="font13">s. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s dedicated Servants are the prim</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">ary</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"> source of this Support.</span><span class="font13"> Jehovah’s Witnesses have not looked to the public to support this most urgent Kingdom proclamation work. We have never before nor are we now engaged in public fund-raising. However, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">small donations</span><span class="font13"> from sincerely interested and appreciative persons that we meet in the field are appreciated.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT OUR DONATIONS ACCOMPLISH</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">’ Thus, it is appropriate that we be prepared to explain briefly and clearly how our worldwide Bible educational work is supported by voluntary donations. All funds receiv</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ed ar</span><span class="font13">e used to defray the enormous expenses inc</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">urre</span><span class="font13">d in accomplishing the 'Kingdom-preaching work in this modern era. In addition to producing literaturejor worldwide distribution, the Society maintains branch offices, Bethel homes, ministerial and ffiTs-sionary schools, missionaries, traveling overseers, literature distribution centers, and numerous other support services necessary for accomplishing the overall assignment Jesus gave his disciples.—Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The momentous growth taking place among Jehovah’s people has moved many to ask what they can do to Kelp. Most are not able to assist personally with the construction&quot; of new branches and Kingdom Halls or go to distant countries to assist with the evangelizing efforts there. But in order to have some part in these exciting developments to the degree they are able, many publishers and their families make it their practice to se</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">t something aside regular</span><span class="font13">ly for contributing toward the worldwide work. (Compare 1 Corinthians 16: 1, 2.) In this way, all the Society’s activities are supported, including the distribution of literature. No one should </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">view</span><span class="font13"> voluntary donations to the worldwide work </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">as if</span><span class="font13"> they were a </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">mere payment</span><span class="font13"> to cov</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">et' the cost</span><span class="font13"> of the literature.</span></p></li>

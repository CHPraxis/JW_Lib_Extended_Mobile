<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> How we rejoice over Jehovah’s many blessings! In the United States during this service year, there have been new peaks in publishers, pioneers, and home Bible studies. There was also a fine Memorial attendance of 1,910,194. Thousands of publishers have attended special conventions in various lands, and all oTTFs have benefited from the bountiful supply of spiritual food provided in our fine circuit assembly and special assembly day programs. We have also received many other blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> How can we show our appreciation for all that Jehovah does for us? We can do this by praising God’s name to the full!—Ps. 145:21.</span></p></li></ul>

By preparing diligently and carrying a s</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">electio</span><span class="font11">n of these brochures with us in field service, we will be equipped to praise Jehovah and possibly help others learn how they too can praise him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Topic for Conver</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">sati</span><span class="font11">on is “A New World—By Whom?’<sup>r</sup>We could prepare appropriate introductions based on the information on pages. 9-15.jof </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> It is easier, to be enthusiastic about an activity when we enjoy.it. It is also generally true that a person enjoys doing something for which he is prepared. That certainly is true in fully accomplishing our ministry. —2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARATION ESSENTIAL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Our enthusiasm in the field ministry is directly related to how well we have preparedfand how 6ftenwfi_go Oiltjn service. For'example, if somie-one we meet in the house-to-house ministry identifies himself as a Muslim, what could we say? A well-prepared publisher might respond: “That’s interesting. I have not talked with many Muslims. But I have read something about a few teachings of your religion in this handbook. [Turn to page 23 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book.] It says you believe that Jesus was_a prophet but that Muhammad was_the last and most important prophet. Is that not so? [ Allow response. ] Do you also believe that Moses was a true prophet? [Allow response, likely in emiah 10:23 shows that man cannot resolve his own problems. It is reassuring to know that God’s promise to do something about World conditions today will not fail. This, promise is found at 2 </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Peter 3;1</span><span class="font11">3/lf*the householder appears to be genuinely interested, offer an appropriate brochure.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARE WELL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Preparation is essential if we are to be effective in teaching others. Why not prepare with other family members, with the one who taught you the truth, or with someone in your book study group? By rehearsing your presentation, you will feel more confident </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span><span class="font11"> manifest personal convictign when speaking to people in the territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Our presentations should reflect our interest in people. Emphasize the Bible’s promise of a new’worTcfto offer hope to depressed and discouraged ones. When the householder accepts the brochure, you may demonstrate our Bible study program.'OF'you may decide it would be more appropriate to do th</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">at on t</span><span class="font11">he retur</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">n visit</span><span class="font11">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> As we come to the end of this momentous service year, what a joy it is to be the recipients of so many blessings from Jehovah! May all of us use this remaining month of the 1991 service year to praise Jehovah’s name to the full as we eagerly look forward to serving Jehovah forever in his new world.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> It is difficult for many of us to remember specific page numbers. But with a little preparation and practice, we can use the section called “Conversation St</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">oppe</span><span class="font11">rs” near the beginning of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book. Included in that section are several pages of information to help us respond to people who identify them-, selves.with a particular'religion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book also has a fine section on introductions. Why not pattern your introductions after these? We may need to adapt our presentation to the situation. At the end of many of the subjects in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book, there is a section “If Someone .Says,” providing pointed material in answer to specific questions or objections related to the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p>

World leaders frequently speak about their plans for a better world. On what do their hopes rest? Do you believe that men are capable of bringing in a better world? [Allow response.] The prophet Jeremiah had something to say about this as recorded at Jeremiah 10:23. [Read.] We can be optimistic about the future only because we have learned about the promise God himself made. And his promise will not fail. Here is what the apostle Peter wrote. [ Read 2 Peter 3:13.] Notice how this sure promise from God is highlighted in this brochure.” Publisher then proceeds to show the householder appropriate information in the brochure being .presented.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Planting and Watering—Steps Toward Making Disciples</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow.” (1 Cor. 3:6) The apostle Paul thus identified threg basic steps in the process of making disciples of Christ. The first two steps, planting and watering, involve a privilege’and respons</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ibilit</span><span class="font11">y resting on dedicated, baptized se</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">rvants of God</span><span class="font11">.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">- This calls for preaching publicly and from house to house, informally, and in other ways. It also involves progressively teaching people to observe all the things Jesus commanded. (Matt. 28:19, 20) This latter step can be carried out only by. making return visits on those who sljow interest, engaging them in Bible dis-cussionsj.and conducting Bible studies with them. Are you proving yourself to be a loyal fellow worker, cooperating with Jehovah by planting seeds of truth and then following t</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">hroug</span><span class="font11">h with the necessary watering and cultivating?—1 Cor. 3:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">RECOGNIZE POTENTIAL AND NEED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> In the United States during the 1990 service year, we distributed almost 11.5 million books and booklets and close to 94 million magazines! We also had over 1.8 million people at the Memorial, far exceeding the 8T6,4TT aveYage publishers for The year. Literature distribution is an integral part of the planting aspect of our work. The seeds of truth thus sown hdlcTtremen-dous potential for producing new disciples, but do </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">we^ </span><span class="font11">as God’s fellow workers, feel moved to make return visits on these people and cultivate their interest in Bible topics? Congregation publishers in the United States now average 0.5 Bible studies. We are confident that this average would improve if each publisher would assess more accurately his personal responsibili</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ty to go beyond the initial step</span><span class="font11"> of just planting seeds of truth and reach out to conduct progressive home Bible studies. Although some, because of various limitations, may not be able to conduct one or more home Bible studies, it is good for each one to review his personal </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">circumstance</span><span class="font11">s.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> It is interesting to see what is taking place in some areas. Congregations have fruitful territory and report an average of from onejto two Bible </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">studies per pub</span><span class="font11">lisher. The increase in new disciples is proportionate to the number of Bible studies being conducted. This can be seen by com</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">parin</span><span class="font11">g the average number of publishers with the number of Bible studies in various countries as reported in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1991 Yearbook.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Our motivation to conduct Bible studies should be our love for people who respond to the Kingdom message we preach?~We must sincerely share Jehovah’s loving concern for people and appreciate that their salvation is connected with spiritual growth. (1 Pet. 2:2) Like literal plants that require water to nurture their progress, people who show an initial interest in the Kingdom message will not usually start attending meetings unless through home Bible studies they are regularly directed to God’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Obedience on our part also enters into the picture. Jesus said that those on the side of the truth listen to his voice. (John 18:37) He commanded his disciples to preach and to teach, and he equipped them to carry out that work. By his outstanding example as a teacher and by his deep concern for people, Jesus set the pattern for us to follow in helping others. (Luke 6:40; John 13:13; 14:12) Our efforts^can contribute toward the salvation of bot</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">h ourselves</span><span class="font11"> and those we teach. —1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">AIDS FOR STARTING BIBLE STUDIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> To perfect his work, a skilled craftsman selects his tools from a variety at his disposal. As teachers, we have at our disposal a host of publi</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">catio</span><span class="font11">ns, including brochures and tracts, designed as tools to help us reach the heart of people with varying backgrounds and points of view.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Some publishers have experienced good results in using tracts and brochures to introduce Bible discussions. For example, the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">tract</span><span class="font11"> </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World</span><span class="font11"> cites or quotes more than 20 differenttexts in outlining this wonderful hope. These scriptures can be used for developing several stimulating Bible discussions. Our brochures, in an e</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ye-ca</span><span class="font11">tching and simple way, can also acquaint people with basic Bible truths and stimulate them to investigate further.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Do you know someone with limited education or who is visually impaired? Have you tried using the brochure </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!</span><span class="font11"> to establish a progressive Bible discussion with such a one? The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!&quot;</span><span class="font11"> brochure is another fine tool with opening paragraphs that skillfully involve the householder in learning about God’s promises for the future. And certainly the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth,</span><span class="font11"> released in 1982, has been effective in aiding a large percentage of the more than 1,700,000 that have been baptized since then.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ACTING RESPONSIBLY TOWARD INTERESTED ONES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> You may find it beneficial to look at your Congregation’s Publisher Record card and take note of the number of books, booklets (including brochures), and magazines you placed during the past 12 months. Were those placements an.end in.themselv.es? Or did you go beyond the step of planting? Of those individuals who showed enough interest totake some of our literature, how many did you promptly contact again? Did you return to see if the seed you planted had sprouted? Did you follow through with needed watering and then pray to Jehovah to make it grow?—Compare Acts 16:14 and 2 Thessalonians 3:1.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>11</sup> Maybe you are not making return visits or conducting a Bible study because you feel inadequate. Likely, this is due to.your attitude more than to a lack of ability. Jehovah has not sent his people out to do a work without adequately equipping and qualifying them. Through his holy Word and org</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">anizati</span><span class="font11">on, he prepares us for “every good work.” (2 Tim. 3:16, 17;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">2 Cor. 3:5, 6) By holy spirit, printed page, and oral instruction and demonstrations from the platform, not to mention living examples of skilled and devoted servants ready to help us, He gives us what we need. We do </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">not need the higher ed</span><span class="font11">u</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">cati</span><span class="font11">on of the world in order to conduct a Bible study. We do need to respond to the superior spiritual education given through Jehovah’s organization.—Compare Acts 4:13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>12</sup> Personal application of what is provided in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> the Theocratic Ministry School, Service Meetings, and other avenues of instruction is necessary. The apostle Paul straightforwardly told the Hebrew Christians^ “For, indeed, although you ought to be teachers in view of the time, you again need someone to teach you from the beginning the elemen-. tary things of the sacred pronouncements of God.”. (Heb. 5:12) A person working at a </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">trad</span><span class="font11">e for several years is expected to have gained a measure of skill in the use of his tools. Progress in learning how to carry on Bible discussions will be evident when we show sincere interest and put forth diligent effort.—Prov. 12:24; 22:29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>13</sup> Calling bads and further discussing Bible topics with those who show interest in the Kingdom message costs somethi</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ng in t</span><span class="font11">he wav of time and effort. But we should appreciate that our being in the truth is an expression of Jehovah’s love and undeserved kindness. This was expressed through someone who spentmany hours patiently teaching us the truth. Likewise, Jove should compel us to buy out the necessary time and devote it to this more important work of making disciples.—2 Cor. 5:14, 15; Eph. 5:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>14</sup> Many congregations have followed the Society’s suggestion to make arrangements for evening witnessing. The early evening hours are usually a good time to make return visits on those who have shown interest. A house-to-house record, providing pertinent information about' the Individuals witnessed to, is essential for making effective return visits and initiating Bible discussions. Do not tuck such records away in a book or in a Bible and forget them. Not remembering to make a return call until weeks later when you happen to be in the neighborhood leaves the person open to being visited by Satan’s agents, who delight in snatching away what may have been sown in the person’s heart. (Luke 8:12) Will you thwart Satan’s tactics by returning promptly? If you sense your responsibility and appreciate your privilege, you will return promptly, when at all possible.—1 Cor. 9:16, 23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO START A BIBLE STUDY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>15</sup> Starting a Bible study does not involve some difficult, complicated procedure. Some people may readily accept your direct offer to conduct a home Bible study with them. However, many publishers prefer not to mention study but just direct the Bible discussion to that end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>16</sup> Love for people and a sincere desire to help them is needed. Good preparation is also necessary. This should include reviewing notes you may have made on what you have already discussed with the individual and deciding on the approach you will take in furthering the Bible discussion. Have the general direction of your comments in mind-. Will you select a few additional texts on the subject previously discussed? Or could you open the tract or book the person has and consider a few of the opening paragraphs with him? You may choose a subject in which he has expressed interest. Initially, take only 10 or 15 minutes. The time can be gradually increased, depending on the depth of interest shown. Your good judgment should help you discern how to proceed and how long to stay.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>17</sup> An abundance of helpful suggestions have been given over the years to assist you in taking progressive steps toward making disciples. As part of a series, the October and November 1990 issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> carried helpful articles entitled “Reach Hearts Through Effective Bible Studies” and “Directing Bible Students to Jehovah’s Organization.” </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> for February 1987 contained the article “Preparing for and Conducting Home Bible Studies.” A quick check of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font11"> under “Bible Studies” will direct you to additional helpful information.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>18</sup> As a model of how to conduct a study, pay attention to what is done at the Congregation Book Study. Of course, at a home Bible study', you do not have a preassigned amount of . material to cover. So you should pace your coverage of material according to the student’s capacity and needs. Additionally, the service overseer and other experienced publishers and pioneers are more than glad to go along with you and offer practical suggestions on conducting effective Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>19</sup> Realizing that Jehovah plays the key role in our efforts to help people, we should pray not only about finding someone to study with but also about the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">prog</span><span class="font11">ress of interested one§_we have located. Our attitude and feelings should be like those<sub>r</sub>of the apostle Paul when witnessing to King Agrippa : /T could wish to God that whether in a short time or in a long time not only you but also all those who hear me today would become men such as I also am.” (Acts 26:29) Paul wanted his hearers to become genuine disciples of Christ, whether it required a short time or a more extended period of personal assistance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>20</sup> Conducting Bible studies enable</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">s us</span><span class="font11"> (“to bear thorough witness to the good news of the<sup>-</sup> undeserved kindness of God.” <sup>!</sup>(Acts 20:24) Untold numbers may yet be turned frbm darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God. (Acts 26:18) You, the individual dedicated, baptized servant of Jehovah, must do your part by planting seeds of truth and then following' through with needed watering by means of Bible discussions and regular home Bible studies. You can thus find great joy in seeing people become disciples and join with you in helping still others to become disciples of Jesus Christ.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The Congregation </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">Book Study </span><span class="font11">has been designed </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">to help us study </span><span class="font11">(and a</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">pply God’s Word</span><span class="font11"> and in this way grow in wisdom and spiritual comprehension. Regularly attending the Congregation Book Study, therefore, should be an integral part of our personal program for acquiring wisdom.—Prov. 4:7-9.</span></p></li></ul>

They remainecLbabes in Christ and thus were unacquainted with the word of righteousness. (Heb. 5: 11-13) The apostle Paul exhorted the congregation to “press on to maturity.” (Heb. 6:1) Obviously, this requires </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:line-through;">more than casually listening </span><span class="font11">to others discuss the truth. Thought and research </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">are required</span><span class="font11"> to arouse our “clear thinking faculties,” and we must exert ourselves vigorously. —2 Pet. 3:1, 2; Luke 13:24.</span></p></li>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Purposeful hard work that produces desired results is most satisfying. (Eccl. 3:13) What work performed today holds the greatest potential for happiness now and on into the indefinite future? There is but one answer—the doing of God’s will. The reasons for this will be thoroughly examined by means of talks, demonstrations, and experiences on our special assembly day program for the 1992 service year. The theme of the program will be “Working Hard at Doing God’s Will.”—Eph. 6:6; 1 Tim. 4:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Many today are deeply dissatisfied and frustrated over their lot in life, a large part of which is filled by an occupation they do not enjoy. In contrast, doing Jehovah's will in imitation of Christ fills our life with pur-quickly underlining the basic answers to the questions. We need timp to savor </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">the materia</span><span class="font11">l by meditating upon its meaning and its value to us personally. Look up the cited scriptures and th'</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">irik o~n~how</span><span class="font11"> they relate td“p6ints in the paragraphs. Look up words not fully understood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> For some of us, personal study may be hafB work, and it does take time; but, oh, how beneficial! Paul pointed to the results of such intense study, saying:(“But solid food belongs to mature&quot;people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.’) (Heb. 5:14) Such personal study h</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">elps us to grow</span><span class="font11"> to maturity, so thaf we can determine the right </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">course</span><span class="font11"> when we are faced with decisions to make.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PARTICIPATE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> We should </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">strive to participat</span><span class="font11">e in each meeting. Why? Not only are our well-prepared comments an expression of our faith but they also encourage and build up our brothers.

What are some things we must guard against in order to continue living for God’s will? With respect to the preaching and teaching activity, how important is it to follow the directions and suggestions given by Jehovah’s organization? What unique opportunities are there for youths who concentrate on doing God's will?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> These questions will be satisfactorily answered by the program, which includes the two primary talks “Does God’s Will Govern Your Life?” and “Our Purpose in Life—Doing God’s Will.&quot; Plan now to be on hand and enjoy this special program to the full.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO PREPARE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Be alert to any publications that will be discussed at the Service Meeting and have th</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ese with you</span><span class="font11"> to refer to during discussions and demonstrations. In tliis way, you can benefit more fully from the preparation of others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> It is beneficial to spend some time preparing for service. Be sure you have oEfained the lite</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:line-through;">r</span><span class="font11">a</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:line-through;">tu</span><span class="font11">re you need. Take a few minutes </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">to look</span><span class="font11"> at the Topic Jor Conversation. Review local concerns. You may even wish to refer </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">to your last visit</span><span class="font11"> in the neighborhood, thus minimizing this as a basis for objection. If you took note of a me</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">aningfu</span><span class="font11">l </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">comment</span><span class="font11"> the householder made d</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">uring your last visit, </span><span class="font11">such can be used as a stepping-stope to further interest-arousing conversation.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;"> View people as Jehovah does</span><span class="font11">, and keep on s</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">howing concern for those </span><span class="font11">who may have told! us.that they are definitely not i</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">nterest</span><span class="font11">ed.

(2Chron. 36:15; Jer. 7:13) Many who at one time felt that they were not interested are </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">our </span><span class="font11">brothers .and sisters today. Even bitter opposes have been won over to the truth. These are now g</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ratefu</span><span class="font11">l that someone patiently continued to call on them with the good news.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">KEEP GOOD RECORDS</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OUTSTANDING MARCH REPORT</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah's blessing on our field ministry is seen in a new peak of 853,966 publishers reporting in March. This is an increase of 3,172 over our January peak. We also reached a peak of 602,340 home Bible studies, indicating an excellent potential for continued growth. The 72,605 auxiliary pioneers reporting in March represents the largest number ever for the month of March. We rejoice as God's fellow workers and look to him for continued growth. —1 Cor. 3:6-9.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Practice Godly Devotion as Christ Did</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The Bible expression “godly devotion&quot; has reference to our deep reverence toward Jehovah God and loyal service to him. The foremost exponent of godly devotion was our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> By his life course here on earth, Jesus distinguished himself as the man of perfect godly devotion. Therefore, we do well to consider some things about his life, especially as they relate to his role as the foremost spokesman for Jehovah God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BE ZEALOUS AND COURAGEOUS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Jesus was zealous in proclaiming what Isaiah 61:2 describes as “the year of goodwill on the part of Jehovah.” After Jesus’ example, we should zealously share in this lifesaving work during the last days of this wicked system of things. We must also be courageous as Jesus was. Why? Because the Kingdom message we proclaim is hard-hitting and disagreeable to some, especially when we speak about the day of Jehovah’s vengeance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> To help us speak with boldness and exhibit godly devotion, we need Jehovah’s spirit and direction. At Luke 4:18, Jesus said: “Jehovah's spirit is upon me.” With Jehovah's spirit and blessing, we also can practice godly devotion and be pleasing to</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Showing Personal</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s interest in others is abundantly evident. Has he not provided generously the material needs of his creation? (Gen. 1:29, 30; 2: 16, 17; Matt. 5:45; compare Luke 6:35.) More importantly, has he not shown personal interest in us by providing for our deliverance from sin and death?—John 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> When Jesus was on the earth, he imitated his Father’s perfect example of showing personal interest in others. (Matt. 11:28-30; 1 Pet. 2:21) When a man full of leprosy said to Jesus, “Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean,” Jesus answered, “I want to,” and healed the man. (Matt. 8:2, 3) Approaching the city of Nain, Jesus encountered a funeral procession bearing a young man, the only son of a widowed mother, and moved with pity, Jesus restored him to life. (Luke 7:11-15) Without being asked, Jesus showed personal interest in others. Even small children were viewed as worthy of his time and attention, and he was never too busy to console and encourage others. —Matt. 20:31-34; Mark 10:13-16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FAMILY AND FRIENDS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> We should endeavor to be like Jehovah and Jesus Christ in looking for ways to show personal interest in oth-Jehovah. To practice something means to become habitual in doing it. It means that something has become our daily way of life. Godly devotion must be a way of life for God’s servants. The apostle Paul stated: “Therefore, whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God’s glory.”—1 Cor. 10:31.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GODLY DEVOTION, OUR WAY OF LIFE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The summer season that is now upon us brings with it vacations, conventions, and other seasonal activities. But we must not lose sight of the continuing need to imitate Christ by taking advantage of opportunities to share the good news with others. As we do this during the month of June, it is recommended that we feature the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> The December 1990 issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> suggested that when people identify themselves as members of some major religious group, we can kindly acknowledge this fact and, perhaps, say: “It is interesting to meet people of different religions. Mankind’s search for God has taken many different directions. [If appropriate at this point, reference can be made to Acts 17:26, 27.] </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Interest in Others</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">ers. Therefore, let us consider some opportunities to do that.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> One of the greatest needs is for brothers to take a genuine personal interest in their own family members and not neglect family spirituality. This includes studying with the family regularly. In your family study, do you consider material in such a way that it is interesting and of practical value? Do you also follow through by regularly working in field service with each member of your household? When you do, is it a happy time? Are you building in your children the desire to help other people, thus showing Christian neighborly love? If married and there are no children at home, do you nonetheless have a family study?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> We want to render spiritual assistance to everyone we can. But in our busy lives, do we forget to show personal interest in members of the congregation who have special needs? (Prov. 3:27; Gal. 6:10) In the Christian congregation, there are fatherless boys, older ones, widows, the infirm, depressed ones, the disabled, and others who have special needs. In imitation of Jehovah and his Son, Jesus Christ, we should not neglect to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page If, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font16"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">NOTE: </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the district convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-by-day review may be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on key points. This well-prepared review will help the brothers remember key points for personal application and use in the field. Comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</span></p>

Family head discusses with family the arrangements needed to ensure summer period will include spiritual activities. One member of family obtained address and meeting times of local congregation in area they will be visiting. Family has sufficient literature to participate in field ministry with the congregation, as well as to take advantage of opportunities to witness informally. Mention is made of situations they may encounter that would present opportunities to give a witness. Family head directs attention to plans for attending “Lovers of Freedom” District Convention and reminds them that at end of each convention day, they will review points from that day’s program, and he explains the benefits of doing so. Family comments briefly on appropriate points from inserts to the January and May issues of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> concerning proper conduct while attending the convention. All eagerly look forward to getting the most theocratically from their summer activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> A great number of newly interested persons attended the Memorial on March 30. Their spiritual progress depends largely upon the help they receive from us. It would be a blessing for them to attend the district convention. We can make them aware of its many spiritual benefits and assist them with their travel arrangements, perhaps inviting them to go with us or with others who may have space in their cars.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Attending the convention opens up added opportunities to do informal witnessing. Advance planning should include packing a supply of the latest publications. We can witness to people who work in gas stations, hotels, and restaurants, as well as those riding public transportation. This is a</span></p>

Under “Trinity” and “Immortality of the Soul,” you will find the subheading “scriptures misapplied to support.” This will direct you to discussions addressing individual texts. A similar feature is found under “Hell,” with its subheading “scriptures misinterpreted.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Do you long to start a Bible study? Or do you have one that does not seem to be progressing? Under the heading “Bible Studies&quot; are the subheadings “starting,” “assisting—,” and “teaching,” each with references to help you find and conduct progressive Bible studies. To help you know when it would be best to discontinue a study, consider the subheadings “terminating unfruitful” and “discontinuing.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Do you desire to reach out for further privileges in the field ministry? The headings “Full-Time Ministry,” “Auxiliary Pioneers,” “Pioneers,” “Missionaries,” and “Serving Where Need Is Greater” direct you to practical material on how to achieve such goals and to delightful experiences enjoyed by those who have already done so.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Youngsters invariably associate summertime with vacation time. While some wholesome recreation is beneficial, can some of this free time be used for a greater share in the witnessing work, such as auxiliary pioneering? Parents can start now to help their children make plans. Perhaps children from different families can enroll and work together as a group. Others not able to enroll can strive to do more, especially in midweek service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Many will have some time off from their secular jobs and will be traveling to other areas. Making plans to attend the meetings of the local congregation and share with them in service can result in a fine interchange of encouragement. You may be going to a locality where there is much seldom-worked territory, enabling you to witness to people who rarely hear the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> At Acts 8:25 we read that Peter and John gave a thorough witness in Samaria and then declared “the good news to many villages.” Today, we also should be diligent in covering the territory assigned to our congregation so that a thorough witness is given.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> With the rapid growth in publishers, many congregations are now covering their territory quite frequently. While our initial reaction to working territories frequently may be negative, this should not be the case. With each issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font13"> there are always new and interesting topics that we may share with the people in our territory.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SHEEPLIKE ONES IN THE FIELD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> How can we show personal interest in people who are having home Bible studies? Many of these have seen the need to cut off association with worldly acquaintances. Even though we are busy, do we show personal interest in such students and make those who have made changes feel welcome as our new friends? Are we a source of encouragement to them even though we are not the ones studying with them?—Compare Mark 10:28-30.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">’ Can you have a greater share in showing sincere personal interest in people who arc willing to listen to the good news? Will you endeavor to help them meet their spiritual needs? Personally, what can you do to have a greater share in the field ministry? Do not hold back if you are now in a position to share more fully.—Luke 9:60-62.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> We must imitate Jehovah and Jesus in showing personal interest in others. We need to be compassionate and reach out to help, as Jesus did in the case of that man who was full of leprosy. Yes, we must always be watchful for ways in which we can show personal interest in others. covered territories especially do well to take more time to converse with the householders. Even young children can enlarge on what interested them in the article. How can this be accomplished? It is vital to be familiar with the articles in the magazines. This requires time and forethought. When reading the magazines, determine what will appeal to people in your territory. Then, before going in service, look over the magazines and pick out topics you will feature. Consider what article you will feature when encountering different circumstances at the doors. Use one of the fine subjects in a magazine as a focal point in your introduction. Draw out the householder's views in a friendly conversation. The magazine can be offered where interest is shown.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Since we are presenting literature without charge, there is a need to be more discerning in the use of our literature. Taking time to converse can help us to determine if the person is really interested. In this way, we are less likely to leave magazines with individuals who will not take the time to read them. We can thus make wise use of our literature.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">KEEP IN MIND OUR PURPOSE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Our purpose in going from door to door is not to see how many magazines or books we can distribute. Our desire is to help others come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. Peter and John spoke the word of Jehovah to the Samaritans in a thorough manner, and we likewise want to spend the time necessary to see that people in our territory are given an opportunity to respond to the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> By effectively using the magazines as a basis for our conversations, we can accomplish this purpose. We should pray for ourselves and others that we may be given “ability to speak ... to make known the sacred secret of the good news, ___with boldness.”—Eph. 6:18-20.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> So most of us will be having some extra time available.

<p><span class="font13">• How often should students have assignments in the Theocratic Ministry School?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One of the main purposes of the Theocratic Ministry School is to develop public speakers. For that reason, the Theocratic Ministry School Schedule makes provision for most of the talks to be assigned to brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">However, another important objective of the school is to train all of Jehovah’s people to be effective preachers and teachers in the Christian ministry. For this reason, it is appropriate for sisters also to enroll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To benefit fully from the school, those enrolled should regularly receive student assignments. It is suggested that each student have at least one assignment every three months. If local circumstances allow, brothers can be given additional assignments. It is not necessary for elders who regularly give instruction talks and Bible highlights to be assigned student talks also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">For nearly half a century, the Theocratic Ministry School has helped millions to make spiritual progress and learn how to express themselves better in presenting the Kingdom message. All are encouraged to make full use of this marvelous provision from Jehovah God. Our aim should be to present ourselves approved to God, workmen “with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.”—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p>

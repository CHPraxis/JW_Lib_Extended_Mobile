<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Preach Without Letup</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> At times, we may feel that our territory has been worked repeatedly and thoroughly with minimal response. Yet, there are compelling reasons for us to keep preaching.—Matt. 28: 19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> For a Witness: </span><span class="font11">Jesus foretold that Kingdom preaching would be a significant part of the composite sign of “the conclusion of the system of things” and that it would be done “for a witness to all the nations.” (Matt. 24:3,14) When people observe us engaging in preaching the Kingdom good news, a powerful witness is given. After we leave the area, some people may talk about our visit for hours or for days, even if they did not listen to the message. Appreciating the reasons for our ministry helps us to persevere. We are pleasing Jehovah by having a share in fulfilling Bible prophecy by giving a witness and sounding a warning message.—2 Thess. 1:6-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Perseverance Needed: </span><span class="font11">Because people have so many distractions and so many demands on their time, perseverance is required of us when we endeavor to further their interest. One woman was called on every week for a year before she decided to invite the Witnesses into her home for a Bible discussion. She liked what she heard so much that she accepted a Bible study, began attending meetings, and soon expressed a desire to get baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> World conditions are changing rapidly, and so are people. Many who rejected our visit in the past may now embrace the refreshing hope we share. If only one person responds favorably to the Kingdom message, our perseverance will have been worth it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Worldwide, more and more people are “sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done.” (Ezek. 9:4) Kingdom fruitage proves that those who are righteously disposed are responding to the Kingdom message. (Isa. 2:2, 3) Therefore, let us continue to preach without letup by lovingly persevering in “bringing good news of something better.” —Isa. 52:7; Acts 5:42.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Is Your Family Preparing for Survival?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Fulfilled Bible prophecy gives convincing evidence of the fast-approaching end of this wicked world. We now live in critical times very similar to those before the Flood. (Matt. 24:37-39) Noah survived the destruction of that ancient world because he “walked with the true God.” (Gen. 6:9) Noah must have taught his family Jehovah’s ways because they too were preserved alive. In what way can we imitate Noah and prepare as a family to survive the end of this present wicked system of things?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Preacher of Righteousness: </span><span class="font11">Noah persevered for some 40 to 50 years as “a preacher of righteousness.” (2 Pet. 2:5) His neighbors, whether under the influence of rebellious materialized angels or not, must have scoffed at his preaching. Our ministry is often met with apathy and ridicule, proving that this system of things is near its end. (2 Pet. 3:3, 4) However, unlike people in Noah’s day, many are responding to our efforts and ‘streaming’ to Jehovah’s worship. (Isa. 2:2) We will save ‘ourselves and those who listen to us’ only if we persevere. (1 Tim. 4:16) How vital it is for parents to teach their children about the urgency of the preaching work both by word and by example!—2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> He Did “Just So”: </span><span class="font11">The survival of Noah and his family depended on their carefully following Jehovah’s instructions. (Gen. 6:22) It is also important for us today to be “ready to obey” direction from the Bible and the faithful slave. (Jas. 3: 17) Adult children in one family recall how their father applied suggestions received from Jehovah’s organization. For example, he conducted a family study every week and took the family in the ministry every weekend as recommended. He endeavored to have one of his children accompany him in the ministry each week. His steadfastness in doing “just so” made a deep impression on his children, and all six of them grew up to be loyal servants of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The end of this system will come suddenly. (Luke 12:40) By imitating Noah and exercising faith for salvation, we and our family will surely be ready! —Heb. 11:7.</span></p>

July: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Keep on the Watch!</span><span class="font10"> If the congregation does not have this brochure in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. If that Is not possible, offer another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. August: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Worship the Only True God.</span><span class="font10"> If the congregation does not have this book in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. If that is not possible, offer an appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font10"> book be studied. September: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">What Does the Bible Really Teach?</span><span class="font10"> Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. When householders already have this publication, show how they can benefit from it by briefly demonstrating a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ Since August has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ Someone designated by the presiding overseer should audit the congregation’s accounts for the months of March, April, and Maj'. When this has been done, an announcement should be made to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.—See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Instructions for Congregation Accounting </span><span class="font10">(8-27).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ It is recommended that applications for regular pioneer service be submitted to the branch office </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">at least 31) days</span><span class="font10"> before the requested start date. The congregation secretary should review the forms to make sure that they are complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it. The secretary should note this date on the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Congregation’s Publisher Record </span><span class="font10">(S-21) card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ Since January 2008, audio files of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> in English and Spanish have been made available at the Web site wwwjw.org. Many prefer downloading these audio magazines, which become available before the CD or MP3 discs arrive in the congregations. Whenever a download is made, the organization does accrue a charge. However, this distribution is more economical than manufacturing and shipping discs. Therefore, publishers who download the magazines are encouraged to cancel their order for CD or MP3 discs with the magazine servant. Audio programs in additional languages will progressively become available through </span><a href="http://www.Jw.org"><span class="font10">www.Jw.org</span></a><span class="font10">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> More and more frequently, Kingdom publishers around the world are finding interested people who speak a language other than that of the congregation. In order to assist such ones spiritually, many branches are finding it necessary to form language groups and congregations. Since a number of languages may be spoken in one area, several congregations of different languages may preach in the same territory. How may the congregations cooperate in order to make sure that the preaching work is carried out in an orderly manner?—1 Cor. 14:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Good Cooperation: </span><span class="font11">When doing street work or when witnessing informally, a publisher should feel free to approach anyone, including those who may speak another language, and offer literature in the language that the person prefers to read. However, when going from house to house in neighborhoods that are also worked by some other language group or congregation, a publisher should generally focus on the homes of those who speak the language of the congregation that the publisher attends. When different congregations preach in the same neighborhood, good record keeping is paramount. The</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">1. Why is there an increasing need for cooperation when working the territory?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. When preaching from door to door, how may we cooperate with a different language group or congregation in our area? service overseers should communicate with each other and coordinate matters in a mutually agreeable way. (Prov. 11: 14) However, if someone who speaks another language is encountered while going from door to door and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">there are no congregations of that language</span><span class="font11"> nearby, the publisher should endeavor to give a witness and to care for the interest.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> The Same Work: </span><span class="font11">How should matters be handled when publishers from different congregations happen to be preaching in the same neighborhood on the same day? Of course, Christian love will transcend any language barrier, and all will be primarily concerned about the needs of the territory. (John 13:34, 35) Therefore, those taking the lead will demonstrate reasonableness and love in deciding whether one group should temporarily move to a different territory.—Jas. 3: 17, 18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The Bible prophesied that people of different tongues would hear the good news. (Rev. 14:6, 7) By close cooperation among all involved, unnecessary duplication of effort can be avoided and many new ones will be reached with the good news, including those who speak another language. —Eph. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We Have Precious Treasures to Share</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> God’s Word abounds with spiritual treasures that we cherish. (Ps. 12:6; 119:11, 14) On a particular occasion, Jesus used illustrations depicting different aspects of the Kingdom, and then he asked his disciples: “Did you get the sense of all these things?” Upon receiving an affirmative reply, he said to them: “That being the case, every public instructor, when taught respecting the kingdom of the heavens, is like a man, a householder, who brings out of his treasure store things new and old.&quot;—Matt. 13:1-52.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Bible truths that we learned when we first began studying can be viewed as old treasures. By means of our progressive personal study of the deeper things of God’s Word, we find other Bible truths, which to us are newfound treasures. (1 Cor. 2:7) Also, through “the faithful and discreet slave,” we come to understand new treasures.—Matt. 24:45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> We highly esteem these spiritual treasures, old and new. This moves us to seek to receive training and gain experience as instructors of God’s Word, generously sharing with others precious truths we have learned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Learn From Jesus’ Example: </span><span class="font11">Demonstrating how he felt about these treasures, Jesus went to great lengths to share them with others. Even when he was tired, he did not stop bringing treasures out of his “storehouse.”—John 4:6-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Jesus’ love for those in a poor spiritual condition motivated him to share the lifegiving treasures of God’s truths. (Ps. 72:13) He felt pity for those with spiritual hunger and was moved to “teach them many things.”—Mark 6:34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Imitate Jesus: </span><span class="font11">When we highly esteem the treasures we have, we will, like Jesus, be eager to show people spiritual gems directly from the Bible. (Prov. 2:1-5) Although at times we may be tired, we will speak about Scriptural truths with heartfelt enthusiasm. (Mark 6:34) Our deep appreciation of the treasures we have will move us to extend ourselves in the ministry, always seeking to have a fuller share.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare New Ones to Face Opposition</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When individuals begin studying the Bible and ‘desire to live with godly devotion,’ they become special targets of Satan. (2 Tim. 3:12) Opposition can come from workmates, schoolmates, or neighbors. It can be especially trying when well-meaning relatives oppose new ones.—Matt. 10:21; Mark 3:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Opposition Foretold: </span><span class="font11">New ones must understand that persecution is to be expected and that it is an indication of their becoming genuine disciples of Christ. (John 15:20) At times, opposition from others may be due to misconceptions about Jehovah’s Witnesses. Keep in mind that great joy comes from being dishonored for being a follower of Jesus and for obeying God. (Acts 5:27-29, 40, 41) Assure new ones of Jehovah’s loving support. (Ps. 27: 10; Mark 10:29, 30) Maintaining their integrity puts them on Jehovah’s side of the issue of universal sovereignty.—Prov. 27:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Role of Accurate Knowledge: </span><span class="font11">Impress upon your Bible students the importance of continuing to take in accurate knowledge despite the trials they may be facing. Through opposition, Satan tries to prevent what they are learning from taking root in their figurative heart. (Prov. 4:23; Luke 8:13) They must keep taking in accurate knowledge of God’s Word so as to become firmly rooted in the faith.—Ps. 1:2, 3; Col. 2:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Need for Endurance: </span><span class="font11">In any trialsome situation, endurance is essential and can produce fine results. (Luke 21:16-19) When new ones endure opposition, they benefit themselves and others. They experience Jehovah’s ability to bless richly those who faithfully endure. —Jas. 1:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The apostle Paul rejoiced in the spiritual progress of his brothers in Thessalonica. He thanked God for them, many of whom he had aided into the truth. (2 Thess. 1:3-5) We too can experience the same joy and satisfaction if we prepare our Bible students to face opposition and endure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">■ If a couple wish to use the Kingdom Hall for their wedding, what matters do they need to discuss with the elders?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Weddings that are arranged in accord with Bible principles bring honor to Jehovah. This is especially true with regard to weddings at the Kingdom Hall, since the community views programs held there as a reflection of our organization. So that “all things take place decently and by arrangement,” it is proper for the local elders to be involved when the Kingdom Hall is requested for a wedding.—1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A couple wishing to use the Kingdom Hall for their wedding should submit a written request to the service committee of a congregation that meets at that hall. Their letter should be submitted well in advance and should indicate the date and time they wish to use the hall. They should keep in mind that the elders will not rearrange the meeting schedule to accommodate a wedding. In addition, the bride and the groom must be in good standing, living in harmony with Bible principles and Jehovah’s righteous standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To make sure that the wedding reflects well on our dignified God, the couple should discuss the wedding arrangements with the service committee before they are finalized. Though the elders will not try to impose their personal preferences upon the couple, if anything objectionable is being planned, adjustments should be made. Only music selected from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Melodies</span><span class="font11"> or that is found in our songbook may be used. Any decoration of the Kingdom Hall or rearrangement of the chairs must also be approved. If photographs are being taken or video recordings are being made, this should not detract from the dignity of the occasion. The elders may permit a rehearsal at the Kingdom Hall as long as it does not interfere with other congregation arrangements. No invitations should be placed on the information board. However, the elders may have a brief announcement made during the Service Meeting to inform the congregation about the upcoming wedding at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Although it is not a requirement that all in the wedding party be baptized, it would not be appropriate to include in the wedding party individuals whose lifestyle grossly conflicts with Bible principles or whose conduct would raise questions in the minds of those attending. The wedding should be officiated by an appointed elder, if available. Elders are qualified teachers of God’s Word, so they are most qualified to highlight the Scriptural principles that apply on this important occasion.—1 Tim. 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Since the wedding also reflects upon the elder who will perform the wedding, he too should be kept informed of the wedding arrangements. He will meet with the couple to inquire about their moral conduct during courtship; the couple will want to be open and honest with him. If either the bride or the groom was previously married, that one must establish that he or she is Scripturally and legally free to marry. (Matt. 19:9) This would include showing the elder a copy of the final divorce decree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the couple freely communicate and fully cooperate with the elders, the wedding will prove to be a happy occasion for all.—Prov. 15:22; Heb. 13:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> One of the most rewarding aspects of the ministry is teaching someone the truth. Seeing him respond to the Kingdom message and assisting him in drawing close to the Sovereign of the universe is an experience to be cherished. (Jas. 4:8) To teach someone who is hungering for truth and watch that one. begin to make significant changes in his personality, outlook, and conduct should be a goal of every Kingdom publisher.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Rely on Jehovah: </span><span class="font11">In times past, faithful servants questioned their qualifications to fulfill their commission. Reliance on Jehovah God enabled Moses, Jeremiah, Amos, and other ordinary people to overcome their own doubts or insecurities and carry out a significant work. (Ex. 4:10-12; Jer. 1: 6, 7; Amos 7:14, 15) The apostle Paul too “mustered up boldness,” or literally, was “made outspoken.” How? He revealed that it was “by means of our God.” (1 Thess. 2:2, ftn.) Yes, all of us can trust in Jehovah to provide the help, wisdom, and strength we need to conduct productive Bible studies.—Isa. 41:10; 1 Cor. 1:26, 27; 1 Pet. 4:11.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Accept Training: </span><span class="font11">Our Grand Instructor, Jehovah God, provides training through a regular program of spiritual education so that we can become fully competent as teachers. (Isa. 54:13; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17) Accept this training by taking full advantage of opportunities 1. What privileged opportunity is before every Kingdom publisher? 2. Why may some hold back from conducting a Bible study, and what will help them to overcome this problem?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">3, 4. What training is in place to assist us in teaching God’s Word? to increase your understanding of the Scriptures and improve in your ability to teach Bible truths. While this is primarily the purpose of the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting, all congregation meetings train us to teach from God’s Word.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Strive to learn simple ways to teach even deep spiritual truths. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School </span><span class="font11">book, page 227, explains: &quot;You must clearly understand your subject yourself if you are going to make it understandable to others.” Commenting at meetings helps us to fix main points in our mind for future use. So prepare well, and your confidence in your ability to teach will grow.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">’From the outset, Christian ministers no doubt learned from one another while engaging in the disciple-making work. (Luke 10:1) If possible, accompany experienced publishers, including pioneers, elders, and traveling overseers, in the Bible study work. Note how they utilize the simple illustrations and other teaching aids found in our study publications to explain Scriptural truths. Ask them for suggestions on how you can become a better teacher. (Prov. 1:5; 27:17) Appreciate all such training for what it is—training provided by God.—2 Cor. 3:5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Rely on Jehovah, and benefit from the training he provides. Make your advancement a matter of prayer. (Ps. 25:4,5) You too can experience the joy of helping someone to become, like you, a teacher of God’s Word!</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In a world filled with pressures and anxieties, we have experienced real relief by responding to Jesus’ warm invitation to find the refreshment provided under his yoke. (Matt. 11:29, 30) Accepting the yoke of discipleship includes engaging in a work that is not only challenging but also refreshing. It involves preaching the good news of the Kingdom and helping others to find refreshment along with us under Jesus’ kindly yoke.—Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Refreshment From the Ministry: </span><span class="font12">Jesus did not ask his followers to add his load to what they were already carrying. He Invited them to trade their heavy load for his light one. No longer are we weighed down with the anxieties and hopelessness of this system of things; neither do we toil for uncertain riches. (Luke 21:34;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">1 Tim. 6:17) Even though we are busy and must work to obtain daily necessities, we center our lives on the worship of God. (Matt. 6:33) We will always find the ministry to be refreshing, not burdensome, if we maintain the proper perspective on what is most important.—Phil. 1:10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Naturally, we enjoy talking about whatever we hold dear to our heart. (Luke 6:45) All Christians care deeply about Jehovah and the Kingdom blessings he has promised. Thus, how refreshing it is to talk about “good news of good things” and leave behind our daily cares while sharing in the ministry! (Rom. 10:15) Of course, the more we do something, the more proficient we become and the more joy we experience. Therefore, devoting more time to the ministry, if we are able, will bring additional refreshment. And how invigorating it is when individuals respond to our preaching! (Acts 15:3) Even when we encounter apathy or opposition, the ministry will bring spiritual refreshment if we keep in mind that our efforts please Jehovah and that any positive results will be due to his blessing.—Acts 5:41; 1 Cor. 3:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> By accepting Jesus’ invitation, we enjoy the privilege of serving alongside him as Witnesses of Jehovah. (Isa. 43:10; Rev. 1:5) Nothing could be more refreshing than that!</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Be Ready for Every Good Work”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When Jesus began a new preaching campaign, he took time to prepare his disciples. (Matt. 10:5-14) Although all of us are busy, our taking even a few minutes to prepare before sharing in the door-to-door ministry will help us to reap fine results.—2 Cor. 9:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> How to Prepare: </span><span class="font12">Good preparation starts with becoming acquainted with the literature we plan to offer. We should also think about the people in our territory. What issues concern them? What religious beliefs are we likely to encounter? We can consult the sample presentations in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom. Ministry </span><span class="font12">and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> for ideas.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’Carefully listening to the demonstrations given on the Service Meeting will also help us. As we gain experience using our presentation, we will need less time to prepare. However, each time before we go in the ministry, if we give some thought to what we will say and continue to refine our presentation, we will be more effective. We should also take a moment to check that our witnessing bag contains what we will need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">•' What will help us remember our presentation? Practicing out loud is one way to fix in our mind what we want to say. Some enjoy having practice sessions during their family study. Others find it helpful to write a short summary of their presentation on an index card and glance at it just before approaching the door.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Why Beneficial: </span><span class="font12">Being well-prepared increases our effectiveness and joy in the ministry. It helps us to relax and to be less nervous at the door. We are able to give greater attention to the householder instead of being preoccupied with what we are going to say. In addition, being familiar with the literature will help us to be more enthusiastic when offering it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The Scriptures urge us to “be ready for every good work.” (Titus 3:1) What better work is there than that of preaching the good news? By being well-prepared, we demonstrate respect for the householder who agrees to listen, and for Jehovah, the God whom we represent.—Isa. 43:10.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Question Box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">■ Is it appropriate for the audience to applaud after each part on the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When the Creator, Jehovah, founded the earth, “the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and all the sons of God began shouting in applause.” (Job 38:7) These angelic sons of God desired to praise Jehovah for his outstanding work of creation, which was a new manifestation of his wisdom, goodness, and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is a fine thing for us to express heartfelt appreciation for the efforts of our brothers and for the material they present. For example, we normally applaud talks and presentations at special gatherings, such as assemblies and conventions. The parts presented there have required additional time and effort to prepare. Our applause shows appreciation not only for the hard work of the speaker but also for the instruction that Jehovah provides through his Word and organization.—Isa. 48:17; Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What about applauding parts presented on the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting? There are no rules forbidding applause if it is done spontaneously, such as after a student has completed his first school assignment. However, applause could easily become perfunctory and lose its meaning. Therefore, we normally do not applaud each presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While we might not applaud for most parts on the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting, there are other ways that all of us can express appreciation for the instruction and for the efforts of those who present parts. We can do this by remaining alert and paying close attention to the speakers. And after the meeting, it is often possible personally to express appreciation for their efforts.—Eph. 1:15, 16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Do you seek greater Joy and fulfillment in your life? Do you find pleasure and satisfaction in helping others? Do you desire to increase your service to Jehovah? If you answer yes to any of these questions, then you should consider regular pioneering. Of course, family and other Scriptural responsibilities, as well as health and physical limitations, must be taken into consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Solomon’s divinely inspired writings associate the blessing of Jehovah with material riches. (Prov. 10:22) Today, Jehovah’s blessing results primarily in spiritual riches. Such riches overflow for regular pioneers. For instance, they experience the greater happiness of giving to others as they ‘buy out the time’ from personal pursuits. (Col. 4:5; Acts 20:35) Their labors of love are noticed and appreciated by Jehovah. Such “treasures in heaven” will never diminish in value. (Matt. 6:20; Heb. 6:10) Furthermore, as pioneers keep a ‘simple eye’ and trust in Jehovah to provide necessities, their relationship with him grows stronger.—Matt. 6: 22, 25, 32; Heb. 13:5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The pursuit of material riches often leads to “many senseless and hurtful desires.” (1 Tim. 6:9, 10; Jas. 5:1-3) This is never the case with the blessing of Jehovah. Spending a significant portion of their time in the ministry helps regular pioneers maintain spiritual balance and a clear focus on the</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">1. Why consider regular<sup>-</sup> pioneering?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. Mention some of the spiritual riches that regular pioneers acquire.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. What contrast exists between the pursuit of spiritual riches and the pursuit of material riches? more important things. (Phil. 1: 10) One brother left his timeconsuming career as an engineer to pioneer. He said: “I found my secular work stressful. Not so with pioneering. I now get to help people and teach them the truth. This has been far more fulfilling and challenging.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Blessings to Others: </span><span class="font12">Today, everyone faces “critical times hard to deal with.” (2 Tim. 3:1) People everywhere desperately need hope. Kingdom proclaimed rejoice at seeing firsthand that the look of despair on people’s faces can change to that of optimism as they respond to the good news. How great that joy is for regular pioneers, who devote more than 800 hours each year to this rescue work!—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Have you been giving serious thought to serving as a regular pioneer? It may require “buying out the opportune time” from less important pursuits. (Eph. 5: 15, 16) Many have done so and have simplified their lives, enabling them to cut back on secular work in order to devote more time to Kingdom interests. Can you arrange your affairs to join them?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Request wisdom from Jehovah to work out a practical schedule. (Jas. 1:5) What blessings can you expect in return? Spiritual riches in abundance! Jehovah will also bless you materially with what you need. (Matt. 6:33) Those who test Jehovah out in this respect will receive “a blessing until there is no more want.”—Mal. 3:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A Special Day for Offering Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Beginning in January, each congregation will designate one weekend every month, perhaps the first one, to concentrate on offering Bible studies. This would be either a Saturday or a Sunday, according to what is best locally. On that day if householders decline to accept such an offer, publishers may still offer the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font14"> book or place the latest magazines. All elders and ministerial servants should arrange to have a full share in this activity and assist publishers to start Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> The Congregation Service Committee will determine on which weekend a day will be set aside to offer Bible studies. Periodic reminders should be given so that publishers can prepare and put forth special effort to offer Bible studies from house to house and when visiting those who previously showed interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How to Prepare: </span><span class="font14">We can find suggestions for starting Bible studies in the January 2006 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> insert and on page 12 of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font14"> book. Some may choose to use a tract, such as </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know the Truth?</span><span class="font14"> Also, page 3 of the August 2007 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font14"> gives suggestions for starting Bible studies when visiting those who accepted the magazines. Elders and ministerial servants will be scheduled to conduct a brief 10- to 15-minute meeting for field service, during which one or two practical suggestions for starting Bible studies should be discussed or demonstrated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Of course, not everyone will accept a Bible study or continue their study over an extended period. This should not cause us to hold back, since it is Jehovah who is drawing sheeplike ones to his organization. (John 6:44) Our responsibility is not just to sow seeds of truth but also to cultivate and water what has taken root, and that includes studying the Bible with righthearted ones. By so doing, we exercise the privilege of being God’s fellow workers. —1 Cor. 3:9.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Preaching Requires Endurance</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> For more than 30 years, the apostle Paul enjoyed a satisfying career as an evangeliz-er. As with any worthwhile endeavor. his preaching activity was not without its challenges. (2 Cor. 11:23-29) Yet, Paul did not give up. (2 Cor. 4:1) He understood that the strength to endure while fulfilling his ministry would come from Jehovah. (Phil. 4:13) In view of his example of faithful endurance, Paul could say: “Become imitators of me, even as I am of Christ.” —1 Cor. 11:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">-’Enduring Trials Today: </span><span class="font14">Each day, many of our brothers face ridicule, opposition, or indifference from family members, workmates, or schoolmates. (Matt. 10:35; John 15:20) Perhaps that is true in your case. On the other hand, you may be contending with a health problem, or you may have a daily struggle to block out distractions and temptations that test your faith and endurance. We can gain strength by considering the examples of faithful servants of old as well as those of fellow Christians today who have faced and overcome challenges.—1 Pet. 5:9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> We can gain power for remaining firm in our ministry by making sure that we have “put on the complete suit of armor from God.” (Eph. 6:10-13, 15) Prayer for endurance is also essential. God grants his holy spirit so that we can endure trials. (2 Cor. 6:4-7) To succeed in our spiritual warfare. we must heed God’s reminders to renew our spirit. (Ps. 119:24, 85-88) Just as a child might read a personal letter from a loving father over and over, our daily Bible reading reinforces our bond with Jehovah. We gain wisdom to cope with trials through regular personal study, thus allowing God’s thinking to influence our decisions and strengthen our integrity.—Prov. 2:10,11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Endurance Brings Blessings: </span><span class="font14">As was true in Paul’s case, our faithful endurance while fulfilling our ministry results in making Jehovah’s heart rejoice and in bringing blessings to us and to others. (Prov. 27:11) May we be determined to persevere in the ministry, thereby proving that our faith is durable and “of much greater value than gold that perishes despite its being proved by fire.”—1 Pet. 1:6, 7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Like the apostle Paul, our desire is to “bear thorough witness to the good news.” (Acts 20: 24) We therefore endeavor to reach as many in our territory as possible with the Kingdom message. This includes the large number of people who live in apartment buildings. At times, it can be a challenge to gain access to those living in such facilities. However, since apartments have a high concentration of people, they present many opportunities for us to spread the good news.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> In the face of the threat of crime and violence, a growing number of apartment buildings are locked and have doormen or surveillance cameras. (2 Tim. 3:1, 2) The management may have a policy that uninvited individuals are not allowed to enter. A superintendent or manager may be inclined to ask us to leave the premises, especially if one of the tenants complains. Therefore, being discreet and demonstrating good judgment are important.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> When to Work: </span><span class="font14">As in other types of territory, it is best to preach in apartments when the residents are likely to be at home. Suspicion may arise if we are present when most tenants are away. Many publishers have been successful in finding people at home in the early evening as well as during Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Working apartments too early, especially on weekends, may result in complaints to the management.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Gaining Entrance: </span><span class="font14">Publishers should not contact the superintendent or any other apartment personnel </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">prior</span><span class="font14"> to engaging in the ministry. If the locked building has an intercom outside the entrance, we can use it to find someone who agrees to let us in to speak with him. Depending upon the type of apartments, we may be able to make other door-to-door calls in the building after speaking with the person who permitted us to enter. In other cases, however, it would be wise to exit the building and use the intercom for contacting</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Some tenants may prefer that you tell them the purpose of your visit over the intercom. If so, introduce yourself in a friendly manner. Use the householder’s name if it is shown on the directory. In a concise way, mention your subject. Some have been successful by reading an introduction directly from the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font14"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> If the building has a doorman who does not permit us to work the apartments, we can endeavor to witness to him. Many doormen enjoy reading our literature. We may even be able to start a Bible study and conduct it in the lobby. If the doorman permits us to visit a specific tenant who has demonstrated interest, it is usually best not to take the liberty of knocking on other doors in the building.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Appearance and Decorum: </span><span class="font14">Carrying large, bulky briefcases can make us conspicuous. Therefore, we may consider using a more discreet case or none at all. Some publishers put the featured literature in a slim portfolio and carry their Bible in their hand or pocket.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> It is best not to congregate in large groups, especially in lobbies or parking lots, as this will draw unnecessary attention. Appropriate precautions should be taken when preaching in apartments that are in high-crime areas. (Prov. 22:3) For example, two or three pairs of publishers might work on the same floor within earshot of each other, perhaps taking turns knocking at the door while the others wait.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> When entering an apartment building, wipe your shoes and close the door securely behind you. By showing such courtesy, we alleviate the tenants’ reasons for complaint. Once inside, proceed purposefully to the elevator or to the floor that is to be worked rather than loitering at the entrance. This will dispel the suspicion of onlookers.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">6. What should we do when working buildings that have a doorman?</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font14">9. How may we demonstrate courtesy, and why is this important?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>10</sup> In many apartment buildings, noise carries in the hallways. Therefore, do not speak louder than is necessary to be comfortably heard by the householder. When talking to other publishers, keep your voice low, but speak in a calm, moderate tone so as to avoid arousing suspicion. So that tenants will not be unduly disturbed, some publishers alternate from one end of the hallway to the other end until the floor is worked, instead of knocking on one door after another down a corridor. In addition, knocking on the door in a loud or authoritative manner may frighten those inside.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>11</sup> If the door has a peephole, stand so that anyone looking out can see you and your companion. Look directly at the peephole, and when you detect that someone is looking out, say a warm greeting and begin your presentation. If the person asks, ‘Who is it?’ you may find it best to give your name and that of the person with you. The householder may then feel better about opening the door. If not, you may still give your presentation through the door.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Not-at-Homes: </span><span class="font14">A frequent complaint of superintendents is that they have to pick up literature from the hallway or the grounds. Literature left outside the door can easily fall to the floor and become litter. Therefore, any literature left at not-at-homes should be placed completely out of sight.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Irate Householders: </span><span class="font14">If we meet an irate householder who may be inclined to call the superintendent, it is best to leave that particular floor and return at another time. In other cases, it would be wise to leave the building entirely in order to avoid a possible confrontation with the superintendent. Even if the householder does not specifically request that future calls not be made on him, it would be better to make note of the apartment number as a do-not-call and place this with the territory card. As with other do-not-calls, these addresses should be contacted periodically to determine the householder’s wishes.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">13. What should we do if we meet an irate householder?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> If You Are Asked to Leave: </span><span class="font14">If while working the building you are asked to leave by the superintendent, security personnel, maintenance personnel, or any other apartment representative, it is wise to comply immediately. Whenever possible, we want to avoid confrontation with resulting threats of legal action and appeals to police. In most cases, apartment personnel are not prejudiced against Jehovah’s Witnesses but are simply doing their job.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>15</sup> At times, when a building representative asks you to leave, you may be able to explain in a kindly and tactful manner the reason for your visit. (1 Pet. 3:15) We recognize his responsibility in keeping the residents happy and in maintaining the security of the building. Perhaps he will allow you to remain in the building. But if not, take your leave graciously. If circumstances allow, you may ask for permission to leave literature at regular intervals in the lobby or laundry room. (Col. 4:6) The service overseer should be kept up-to-date regarding such incidents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>16</sup> Perhaps, after a reasonable period of time, publishers can discreetly attempt to work in the building. However, if problems persist, the elders should contact the branch office for assistance rather than publishers attempting to resolve matters on their own. If publishers are not able to work the apartments, efforts can be made to contact the tenants in other ways, such as by telephone witnessing or writing letters. Some publishers engage in street witnessing in front of or in the immediate vicinity of the apartment building during the morning and evening hours when people generally go to work and return home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>17</sup> The end of this wicked system is coming soon. Only those who call on the name of Jehovah will be saved. “However, how will they call on him in whom they have not put faith? How, in turn, will they put faith in him of whom they have not heard?” (Rom. 10:13, 14) Many who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life” live in apartments. (Acts 13:48) By being discreet and demonstrating good judgment, we can reach them with the good news.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> All of us look forward to the 2009 district convention and the new opportunities to gather with fellow praisers of Jehovah, who are “conscious of their spiritual need.” (Matt. 5:3) With Jehovah’s day fast approaching, we urge each one to be in attendance for </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">all three days</span><span class="font15"> so as to benefit fully from the warm Christian fellowship as well as the spiritual encouragement to stand firm in the faith.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul endeavored to ‘reason from the Scriptures.’ (Acts 17:2, 3; 18:19) In so doing, he imitated Jesus, who frequently quoted the Scriptures and used illustrations to help his listeners understand God’s will. (Matt. 12:1-12) The book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures </span><span class="font14">has been designed to help us do the same.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Preparing Effective Introductions: </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures</span><span class="font14"> contains interestarousing introductions on pages 9-15. Learning and using different introductions, especially if you cover the territory frequently, will add variety to your ministry and help you become more versatile and effective in starting conversations. Introductions may be read directly from the book when engaging in telephone witnessing or when speaking over the intercom in high-security buildings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Overcoming Conversation Stoppers: </span><span class="font14">Why not anticipate the conversation stoppers that may arise in your territory and take a few minutes before preaching to review pages 16-21 for a potential reply? Will some householders likely be Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, or Muslims? If so, the information on pages 21-24 will be helpful.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14">You may simply tell the person that you would like to show him something interesting that you have on the subject and take out your </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font14"> book. Since the subjects are listed in alphabetical order, turn to the main heading that you think will have the information you need. Then scan the questions in boldface type. If you do not quickly see what you are looking for, turn to the index at the back. Once you find the appropriate information, read it directly from the publication. If you are discussing a specific scripture, you may find what you need on page 445 under “Scriptures Often Misapplied.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Other Uses: </span><span class="font14">Some keep a copy of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font14"> book at their job or at school to help them answer questions such as, ‘Why don’t you celebrate holidays?’ Youths have found the information under the headings “Creation” and “Evolution” helpful in preparing school reports. Are you going to visit someone who is sick or who has lost a loved one in death? The material under “Encouragement” may help you to provide Scriptural comfort. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font14"> book also has helpful information for those preparing talks and conducting meetings for field service.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> When preaching, our goal is not to win arguments; neither is it simply to convey information. We want to reason skillfully from the Scriptures.

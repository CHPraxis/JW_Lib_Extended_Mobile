<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Bible Students to Become Publishers of the Kingdom Good News</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The commission that Jesus laid upon his disciples as expressed at Matthew 28:19, 20 was far-reaching indeed. Christ’s disciples were instructed to make more disciples who, in turn, would carry on with the disciple-making work. A foundation would be laid for the final worldwide proclamation of the good news of God’s Kingdom during the momentous time of the end, where we now find ourselves.—Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Our Bible students may be our children or others who are willing to study the Bible with us. We genuinely want to help such ones to accept individual responsibility to help others become disciples of Jesus Christ.—Luke 6:40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Prepare Them to Give a Witness: </span><span class="font13">Urge those you study with to share with others what they are learning. Relate encouraging field service experiences to them. Train your children from an early age to participate in the ministry in a meaningful way according to their ability. (Ps. 148:12, 13) Show by word and example your appreciation for the ministry. —1 Tim. 1:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah uses only those who accept and abide by his righteous standards. Of course, new publishers do not know as much as experienced, dedicated, and baptized Kingdom ministers, but the new ones must believe and be able to explain basic Bible teachings. (See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Organized,</span><span class="font13"> pp. 79-82.) Having completely separated themselves from “Babylon the Great” and all involvement in politics, they should be attending congregation meetings regularly. —Rev. 18:2, 4; John 17:16; Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> As soon as you believe that one of your Bible students qualifies to be an unbaptized publisher, this should be brought to the attention of the presiding overseer. He will arrange for two elders to meet with you and your Bible student to determine whether he qualifies as an unbaptized publisher of the Kingdom good news in association with the congregation. It will then be your privilege to broaden the training of your Bible student as he accompanies you in field service.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Make the Most of Your Time in the Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">‘There is certainly much to be accomplished in our ministry, and the time left is reduced. (John 4:35; 1 Cor. 7:29) With good organization and advance planning, we can make the most of the time we have scheduled for the ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Be Prepared: </span><span class="font13">Before going to the meeting for field service, make sure that you have the literature you will need and have your presentation well in mind. After the meeting is closed with prayer, go directly into the field. This will allow you and those working with you to accomplish as much as possible in the time available for field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> If you are assigned to conduct the meeting for field service, begin on time. Keep the meeting brief—no more than 10 to 15 minutes. Before you dismiss the group, make sure that each one knows where and with whom he is going to work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> While in the Ministry: </span><span class="font13">Once the meeting for field service ends, do not linger unnecessarily, but begin making your way to the territory. If you anticipate having to leave the territory early, perhaps you can arrange for your own transportation so that the rest of the group does not have to leave early. When working with a group, be considerate of the others who may be waiting for you to finish a discussion. That could involve withdrawing tactfully from a person who is argumentative or arranging to call back on one who is interested.—Matt. 10:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> When making return visits, you can avoid unnecessary travel by caring for calls in one neighborhood before going to another. It may be possible to telephone certain individuals to make sure that they will be home. (Prov. 21:5) If you anticipate a lengthy visit, arrangements can be made for those in your group to preach nearby or to make another return visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> We are living in the time of a great spiritual harvest. (Matt. 9: 37, 38) Soon the work will end. Therefore, our desire should be to make good use of our time while in the ministry.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> In a world where good news is scarce, we have the privilege “to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.” (Acts 20:24) This includes letting people know that “the last days” will soon give way to Jehovah’s righteous new world, where “the former things [will] have passed away.” (2 Tim. 3: 1-5; Rev. 21:4) At that time there will be no more sickness. (Isa. 33:24) Deceased loved ones will come out of the memorial tombs and be reunited with family and friends. (John 5:28, 29) The whole earth will be made into a beautiful paradise. (Isa. 65:21-23) This is just a sampling of the good news we have to share!</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">Who May Be Included Among Those Able to Auxiliary Pioneer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Families</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Those who work full-time</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ The elderly and infirm ■ Those in school</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> The months of March, April, and May will provide excellent opportunities to declare such good news. During these months the weather and longer daylight hours in many parts of the world are favorable for spending more time in the ministry. In addition, the most important occasion of the year, the Memorial, will be observed around the world after sundown on Saturday, March 22. Now is the time to begin making preparations to increase our activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Auxiliary Pioneer: </span><span class="font14">Could you arrange your schedule to auxiliary pioneer for one, two, or all three months?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1. What good news do we have to share?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2. Why does the Memorial season provide excellent opportunities to bear witness to the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">3. What will help us to increase our activity as families?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">Why not take some time during your next family study to consider this matter? With good cooperation, one or more members of the family may be able to auxiliary pioneer. (Prov. 15: 22) Make this a matter of prayer, and see how Jehovah blesses your efforts. (Prov. 16:3) Even if no one in the family can auxiliary pioneer, all family members can set specific goals to increase their share in the ministry while working along with those who are able to pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> If you have a fulltime job, a good schedule may enable you to auxiliary pioneer. Perhaps you can use part of your lunch break to preach. Or you can obtain a personal territory near your home or place of employment and share in the ministry for an hour or so before or after work. You may be able to make additional time in your schedule by moving nonessential activities to another month and by spending full days in the ministry on the weekends. Some have been able to take a day or two of vacation time to spend in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> If you are elderly or infirm or have limited energy, you may be able to auxiliary pioneer by spending a little time each day in the ministry. Ask Jehovah to supply you with “power beyond what is normal.” (2 Cor. 4:7) One sister</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">4. How could we schedule our affairs to auxiliary pioneer if we have a full-time job?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">5. How might you assist the elderly or infirm to auxiliary pioneer?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">was able to auxiliary pioneer at the age of 106! With the assistance of her Christian relatives and others in the congregation, she preached from house to house, made return visits, went on Bible studies, and shared in other features of the ministry. She assisted in starting Bible studies with ten people. “As I think about the wonderful privilege I had to serve as an auxiliary pioneer,” she says, “my heart swells with love and appreciation for Jehovah, his Son, and His loving organization. I truly want to say ‘thank you, Jehovah!’ ”</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">When Distributing Memorial Invitations:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Be brief; speak with enthusiasm</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Make note of interest and call back</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Offer magazines on the weekends</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> If you are a baptized youth still in school, you too may be able to enroll as an auxiliary pioneer. Like those who work fulltime, you will probably utilize primarily the weekends for your schedule for the ministry. Perhaps you can also go out for an hour or so after school on some days. Is there a school holiday that you can use for sharing in the ministry? If you would like to auxiliary pioneer, talk to your parents about it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Build Enthusiasm: </span><span class="font14">The elders can do much to build the congregation’s enthusiasm by their example. (1 Pet. 5:2, 3) They may determine to schedule additional meetings for field service for those who will be sharing in the ministry early in the morning, after school, or after work. The service overseer should make sure that qualified publishers are assigned to take the lead and that there is sufficient territory</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">6. How is it possible for baptized youths still in school to auxiliary pioneer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">7. What may the elders do to build enthusiasm for the ministry during the Memorial season? </span><span class="font14">as well as magazines and literature on hand for these months of special activity.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> In one congregation, the elders began encouraging auxiliary pioneering several months in advance. They kept the congregation informed each week regarding how many publishers were approved to auxiliary pioneer. This assured those desiring to increase their share in the ministry that they would have good support. Additional meetings for field service were arranged for the early morning and the evening. The result was that 53 publishers auxiliary pioneered in April, almost half of the congregation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Help Others Preach: </span><span class="font14">When new ones and youths qualify to begin publishing, they may be invited to work in field service with experienced publishers. Such an opportunity may come during the Memorial season when many in the congregation will be increasing their activity. Do you have a progressive Bible student who has brought his life into harmony with Jehovah’s righteous standards? Do you have well-behaved children who are making good progress but who are not yet publishers? If such ones have expressed a desire to become unbaptized publishers and you feel that they qualify, then let one of the elders know. The presiding overseer will arrange for two elders to discuss the matter with you and your child or student.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">8. What do we learn from the experience of one congregation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">9. Why is the Memorial season an excellent time, for those who qualify, to begin publishing the good news?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>10</sup> The coming months would also be an excellent time for those who have become inactive to resume their activity with the congregation. Congregation Book Study overseers and other elders should make a concerted effort to visit such ones and extend a warm personal invitation to work with them in the ministry. If they have been inactive for a long time, two elders should first speak with them to determine if they qualify.—</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font14"> 11/00 p. 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Prepare for the Memorial: </span><span class="font14">The ransom is the greatest expression of “the undeserved kindness of God.” (Acts 20:24) Millions of appreciative people around the world will gather on Saturday, March 22, after sundown, to observe the Memorial of Christ’s death. We want to invite and help all honesthearted ones to attend this important occasion that bears witness to Jehovah’s undeserved kindness toward mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>12</sup> Make a list of those you want to invite. No doubt your list will include relatives, neighbors, acquaintances from work or school, past and present Bible students, and all others whom you visit on a regular basis. If some you invite have questions about the Memorial, you may find it helpful to use the appendix article regarding the Lord’s Evening Meal on pages 206-8 of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font14"> book. This may even open the way for a Bible study, since it will give you an opportunity to introduce the publication we use to conduct Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">10. What can the elders do to assist those who are inactive?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">11. What is the greatest expression of “the undeserved kindness of God?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">12. Whom should we invite to the Memorial?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>13</sup> One sister made a list of 48 families to invite. As she invited them, she crossed off their names and wrote down the date she invited them. How happy she was that 26 people she invited came to the Memorial! A brother who owns a store invited an employee who was formerly a priest. The man attended and afterward exclaimed, “I learned more about the Bible in one hour than I did in the 30 years I spent in the Catholic Church.” Soon after the Memorial, he accepted a study in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach </span><span class="font14">book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> Campaign: </span><span class="font14">Beginning on Saturday, March 1, and continuing to March 22, a special invitation to the Memorial will be distributed earth wide. All will want to have a full share in this important campaign. It is better to give the householder an invitation personally than to leave one at the door. However, if you have a large territory, the elders may determine that invitations can be left discreetly at not-at-homes. On the weekends we will also be offering the current magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>15</sup> Since we have a limited time to distribute the invitations, it is best to have a brief presentation. Be friendly and enthusiastic. You might say something like this: “We want to make sure that you, your family members, and your friends are invited to an important event being held on March 22. Here is your invitation. The details are printed on the invitation.” The householder may have questions. Or he may accept the invitation and even express that he will be present.

<p><span class="font13">17. How do we demonstrate that we have not missed the purpose of God’s undeserved kindness?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">2008 Memorial season approaches, may each one of us reflect on the undeserved kindness of Jehovah in our behalf. The apostle Paul wrote: “We also entreat you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose.” (2 Cor. 6:1) How do we demonstrate that we have not missed the purpose of God’s undeserved kindness? Paul wrote: “But in every way we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers.” (2 Cor. 6:4) Therefore, we demonstrate our appreciation for Jehovah’s gift by our good conduct and zealous preaching of the good news. This Memorial season we will have an excellent opportunity to increase our activity, bearing thorough witness to the good news.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Putting It Off?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">Putting what off? Filling out the DPA (durable power of attorney) card that is provided for baptized Witnesses. Since “you do not know what your life will be tomorrow,” it is crucial that you decide in advance and Indicate in writing what treatments and procedures you would accept in a medical emergency. (Jas. 4:14; Acts 15: 28, 29) To help you, the video </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Transfusion-Alternative Health Care—Meeting Patient Needs and Rights</span><span class="font13"> has been produced. View it, and then prayerfully review what you learned with the help of the questions set out below—Note: Because the video includes brief surgical scenes, parents should use discretion in viewing the video with young children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(1) </span><span class="font13">Why are some in the medical community reevaluating the use of blood transfusions? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) </span><span class="font13">Give three examples of complex surgeries that have been performed without blood transfusions. (3) How many physicians and surgeons worldwide have indicated their willingness to treat patients without blood transfusions? Why are they willing to do so? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(4) </span><span class="font13">What have recent hospital studies revealed about blood use? (5) What are the medical risks associated with blood transfusions? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(6) </span><span class="font13">What conclusion have many experts reached regarding the benefits of transfusion alternatives? (7) What causes anemia? How tolerable is it in humans? What can be done to compensate for it? (8) How can redcell production be stimulated in a patient’s body? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(9) </span><span class="font13">What techniques are being used to minimize blood loss during surgery? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(10) </span><span class="font13">Can transfusion alternatives work for young children or for people involved in life-threatening emergencies? (11) What is one of the primary ethical principles of good medical care? (12) Why is it important for Christians to make nonblood treatment choices in advance? How can we do this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acceptance of some of the treatments featured in the video is a matter for private decision in accord with each one’s Bible-trained conscience. </span><span class="font13">Have you taken a clear position on which medical treatments and procedures you are willing to accept for yourself and your children? For a more complete discussion of these matters, see “Questions From Readers” in the June 15, 2004, and October 15, 2000, issues of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and the insert “How Do I View Blood Fractions and Medical Procedures Involving My Own Blood?” in the November 2006 issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font13"> Your selected health-care agents and any non-Witness family members should be fully informed of your decisions.</span></p>

A special effort will be made to visit newly interested ones who attended the Memorial or the special public talk but who are not actively associated with the congregation. The purpose of such visits should be to start a home Bible study with those who have not yet accepted one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ Since March has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ Starting in February, and no later than March 2, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Where Can You Get Help in Times of Distress?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Congregations should make appropriate arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Saturday, March 22, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown. </span><span class="font13">Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Each congregation should try to hold its own Memorial observance. However, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from some association after the Memorial. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">■ Congregation secretaries should make sure that they have a pioneer appointment letter (S-202) for each regular pioneer in the congregation. Il’ they do not, please inform the branch office in writing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">■ Beginning the week of August 4, 2008, we will study </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live With Jehovah’s Day in Mind</span><span class="font13"> at the Congregation Book Study.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13">■ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men under the age of 26 who are (1) citizens and have reached 18 years of age or (2) noncitizens who move to the United States must register within 30 days. From the time a man registers until he turns 26, he must notify Selective Service within ten days of any change of address. Compliance with this law is a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders should remind those to whom this applies or will soon apply of their duty to register.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ A packet of legal material is available to assist publishers who are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation matters in which our religion is under attack. The packet should be requested by the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">body of elders only</span><span class="font13"> in a case in which it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue.

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">■ What two publications should be studied with interested ones?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book is our main tool for starting and conducting Bible studies. While there is no objection if another publication, such as an appropriate tract, is used to start a study, efforts should be made to switch to the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book as soon as possible. Exceptional results have been obtained by using the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book to start studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Once the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book has been completed and the student is making progress, the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Worship God</span><span class="font13"> book should then be studied. (Col. 2:7) Page 2 explains that book’s purpose: “The Bible urges all who love God to ‘grasp mentally , . . [the] height and depth’ of his precious truths. (Ephesians 3:18) To that end, this book has been prepared. We hope that it will help you to grow spiritually and to be better equipped to walk the narrow road leading to life in God’s righteous new world.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If the student qualifies for baptism before completing both books, the study should continue until the second book is finished. Even though the student is baptized, the conductor may count the time, the return visit, and the Bible study. A publisher who accompanies the conductor and participates may also count the time.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>“Let Your Utterance Be Always... Seasoned With Salt”</span></h4>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.” (Col. 4:6) Seasoning our utterances with salt means choosing correct words and speaking in a manner that will make our comments palatable to the hearer. Doing so while sharing in the ministry is very important.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Jesus’ Example: </span><span class="font13">While resting near a well, Jesus took the initiative to speak to a Samaritan woman who approached to get water. Several times during the conversation, she raised points reflecting the long-standing feud between the Jews and the Samaritans. She also expressed her belief that the Samaritans descended from Jacob, though the Jews felt strongly that Samaritans descended from foreigners. Rather than taking exception to her comments, Jesus kept the conversation positive. As a result, he was able to give a witness that benefited her and the men of the city.—John 4:7-15, 39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> As we preach we should keep in mind our objective—to “declare good news of good things.” (Rom. 10:15) We want to share with the householder an appealing and upbuilding thought from the Bible, not give him the impression that we are attacking his personal beliefs. If he express-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1. What does it mean to ‘season our utterances with salt’?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2. How was Jesus able to witness to a Samaritan woman?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">3. How may we follow Jesus’ example when we are in the ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">es a wrong viewpoint, our reply need not challenge him. Is there something in his comment that we can agree with or use as a basis for genuine commendation? Perhaps we could introduce a scripture by saying, “Have you ever considered this as a possibility?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> What if the householder is abusive or it is apparent that he just wants to argue? We should continue to demonstrate gentleness and mildness in our bearing and words. (2 Tim. 2:24, 25) If the individual does not appreciate the Kingdom message, it is best to excuse ourselves tactfully. —Matt. 7:6; 10:11-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Good Results: </span><span class="font13">When a sister tried to witness to her neighbor, the woman erupted angrily, using profanity. In a kind manner, our sister said: “I’m sorry you feel that way. Please, have a good day.” Two weeks later, the woman knocked on the sister’s door, apologized for her conduct, and expressed a willingness to listen to what the sister had to say. A gracious reply often gets good results!—Prov. 15:1; 25:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Endeavor to use seasoned speech when declaring the good news. Even if the householder is unreceptive, he may be more willing to listen the next time Jehovah’s Witnesses call at his door.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">4. What should we do if the householder is abusive?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">5. How did one sister experience good results from replying with graciousness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">6. Why is it important for us to use seasoned speech in the ministry?</span></p></li></ul>

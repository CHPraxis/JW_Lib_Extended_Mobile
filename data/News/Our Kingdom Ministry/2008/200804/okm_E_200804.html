<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Show Yourselves Thankful”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When Jesus healed ten lepers, only one of them returned to express gratitude. Jesus asked: “The ten were cleansed, were they not? Where, then, are the other nine?” (Luke 17:11-19) How important it is for us to be appreciative and to show ourselves thankful for every good gift and perfect present bestowed upon us by our generous and loving heavenly Father, Jehovah God!—Col. 3:15; Jas. 1:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> What are some things for which to be thankful? We appreciate the ransom, God’s greatest gift to mankind. (John 3:16) We are also thankful to Jehovah for drawing us to him. (John 6:44) Our Christian unity is another reason for being thankful. (Ps. 133:1-3) No doubt you can think of many other gifts from Jehovah. Never would we want to become like the ungrateful Israelites who forgot Jehovah’s works in their behalf!—Ps. 106:12, 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Demonstrate Thankfulness: </span><span class="font13">Though all ten lepers may have appreciated what Jesus did for them, only one </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">showed</span><span class="font13"> himself thankful. (Luke 17:15) Similarly, we demonstrate appreciation by having a zealous share in the ministry. If we are truly thankful for all that our loving heavenly Father has done, our hearts will be moved to reflect his love and generosity by telling others about him. (Luke 6:45) In turn, as we recount to others Jehovah’s ‘wonderful works and his thoughts toward us,’ our love and appreciation for Jehovah will grow.—Ps. 40:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Instill Appreciation in Others: </span><span class="font13">We should be alert to help our children and Bible students to develop appreciation. Parents have many opportunities to do this, such as when enjoying Jehovah’s creation with their children. (Rom. 1:20) When conducting a Bible study, we might ask our student, “What does this tell us about the kind of person Jehovah is?” As the student’s appreciation grows, so will his love for God and his determination to please him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> During these last days, many are unappreciative and unthankful. (2 Tim. 3:1, 2) How it must please Jehovah to see his devoted servants demonstrating thankfulness by their zealous participation in the ministry!—Jas. 1:22-25.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Be a Progressive Minister</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Our heavenly Father is pleased when his servants make spiritual advancement. That includes progressing as a mature and effective minister of the good news. Paul encouraged the overseer Timothy to continue applying himself so that his advancement would be manifest. (1 Tim. 4:13-15) All of us should endeavor to improve the quality of our ministry, even those of us who are experienced publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Set Personal Goals: </span><span class="font13">Making progress requires setting personal goals. What are some goals we may set for ourselves? We might try to become more adept at using our spiritual sword, the Bible. (Eph. 6:17) Perhaps there is a feature of the ministry that we need to improve in, such as street witnessing, telephone witnessing, or working business territory. Perhaps we could work at making more effective return visits. Another excellent goal might be to improve our ability to start and conduct Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Provisions: </span><span class="font13">Congregation meetings, especially the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting, are designed to help us grow as ministers. The more effort we expend preparing for and attending these meetings and applying the suggestions given, the greater the benefits we are bound to receive.—2 Cor. 9:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> We also need to help one another to progress. (Prov. 27:17) Listening carefully to the presentation of those with whom we work in the ministry will help us to improve. In addition, our book study overseer may arrange for us to receive personal assistance. What a blessing it is to have an experienced pioneer or other publisher help us to become more productive and reap greater joy in the ministry! Is there a new publisher in our book study? Perhaps we can take the initiative to invite him to work with us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The most important work being done today is the Christian ministry. As we offer Jehovah our “sacrifice of praise,” we want to give him our best. (Heb. 13:15) If we endeavor to be progressive in the ministry, we will be workmen “with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.” —2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Service Meeting Schedule</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE: </span><span class="font13">A Service Meeting will be scheduled in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Guided by God’s Spirit” District Convention. Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to repeat counsel and reminders from this month’s insert that apply locally. A month or two following your convention, set aside 15 to 20 minutes on a Service Meeting (perhaps using a local needs portion) for a review of points from the convention that the publishers have found to be helpful in the ministry. The service overseer should handle the review. Invite the audience to comment on how they are applying or plan to apply that information in their ministry.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus was not educated in the rabbinic schools, yet he was history’s greatest Minister. Thankfully, a written record of Jesus’ ministry has been preserved for our benefit. In order for us to be effective ministers, we must “follow his steps closely.”—1 Pet. 2:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Demonstrate Love for People: </span><span class="font13">Loving concern for people motivated Jesus. (Mark 6:30-34) Many in our territory are “in pain” and in great need of the truth. (Rom. 8:22) Our reflecting on their dire situation and on Jehovah’s loving interest in them will motivate us to persist in preaching. (2 Pet. 3:9) Furthermore, people will more readily respond to our message if they discern that we genuinely care about them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Speak at Every Opportunity: </span><span class="font13">Jesus took advantage of every opportunity to share the good news with others. (Matt. 4:23; 9:9; John 4:7-10) Similarly, we want to be prepared to talk about the truth as we go about our daily routine. Some keep a Bible and literature handy so that they may witness at work, at school, when traveling and shopping, and so forth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Focus on the Kingdom: </span><span class="font13">The good news Of the Kingdom was the theme of Jesus’ preaching. (Luke 4:43) Although our presentation may not immediately or directly mention the Kingdom, we keep in mind helping the householder see the need for it. Even when mentioning bad world conditions that indicate that we are living in the last days, we primarily “declare good news of good things.”—Rom. 10:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Rely on God’s Word: </span><span class="font13">Throughout Jesus’ ministry he relied on the Scriptures. He taught nothing of his own originality. (John 7:16, 18) He fed on God’s Word and applied it to himself when under Satanic attack. (Matt. 4:1-4) In order for us to teach others effectively, we must read the Bible daily and make personal application. (Rom. 2:21) When answering questions in the ministry, we should cite Scriptural backing for what we say and read directly</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Reach the Heart in Your Teaching: </span><span class="font13">“Never has another man spoken like this.” (John 7: 46) So said the officers about Jesus when the chief priests and Pharisees asked why the officers failed to arrest him. Rather than simply conveying facts, Jesus taught in a way that reached the hearts of those he instructed. (Luke 24:32) He used true-to-life illustrations to breathe life into his words. (Matt. 13:34) Jesus did not overwhelm his listeners with too much information. (John 16:12) He drew attention to Jehovah rather than to himself. Like Jesus, we can become good teachers only by paying ‘constant attention to our teaching.’ —1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Persist Despite Apathy and Opposition: </span><span class="font13">Though Jesus performed powerful works, many did not listen to him. (Luke 10:13) Even members of Jesus’ own family felt that he had “gone out of his mind.” (Mark 3:21) Nonetheless, Jesus persisted. He maintained a positive attitude because he was totally convinced that he had the truth that could set men free. (John 8:32) With Jehovah’s help, we too are determined not to give up.—2 Cor. 4:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Make Needed Sacrifices to Have a Full Share: </span><span class="font13">Jesus sacrificed material comforts for the ministry. (Matt. 8:20) He preached tirelessly, sometimes late into the day. (Mark 6:35, 36) Jesus knew that he had a limited amount of time to accomplish the work. Since “the time left is reduced,” we too need to make personal sacrifices of our time, energy, and resources in imitation of Jesus.—1 Cor. 7:29-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> First-century Christians were effective ministers because they learned from Jesus. (Acts 4:13) We too can fully accomplish our ministry if we imitate history’s greatest Minister.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, APRIL 2008</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>District Convention Reminders</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Program Times: </span><span class="font13">The program will begin at 9:20 a.m. all three days. The doors will open at 8:00 a.m. When the introductory music begins, all of us should take our seats so that the program can begin in a dignified manner. The program will conclude at 4:55 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and at 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Parking: </span><span class="font13">At all convention sites where we have secured control of the parking facilities, the spaces will be made available at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. Convention badge cards will serve as identification for parking. Only those disabled persons who have a state-approved disabled license plate or placard will be allowed to park in the area reserved for the disabled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Seat Saving: </span><span class="font13">Seats may be saved only for those traveling with you in the same vehicle or living with you in the same home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Noon Meal: </span><span class="font13">Please bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under your seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers, glass containers, and alcoholic beverages are not permitted in the convention facility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Donations: </span><span class="font13">We can show appreciation for the convention arrangements by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at our Kingdom Hall or at the convention. Any checks contributed at the convention should be made payable to “Watch Tower.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Accidents and Emergencies: </span><span class="font13">Emergencyresponse services have complained that they receive many cell-phone calls over minor matters. If a medical emergency arises at the convention site, please contact a nearby attendant, who will immediately notify First Aid so that our qualified first-aid personnel on-site can assess the seriousness of the situation and render assistance. If it is necessary, our first-aid personnel will call 911.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Hearing Impaired: </span><span class="font13">The program will be broadcast in the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. To make use of this provision, you will need to bring a small battery-operated FM receiver along with earphones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Baby Strollers and Lawn Chairs: </span><span class="font13">Baby strollers and lawn chairs should not be brought to the convention site. However, child-safety seats that can be secured in a seat next to the parents are acceptable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Fragrances: </span><span class="font13">Most conventions take place in enclosed areas where we depend on mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be a kindness for us to limit the use of strong fragrances, colognes, and perfumes that may cause reactions in those who suffer from respiratory or related problems.—1 Cor. 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Follow-Up Forms: </span><span class="font13">A </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Please Follow Up </span><span class="font13">(S-43) form should be used to provide information regarding any who show interest as a result of our informal witnessing during the convention. Publishers should bring one or two follow-up forms to the convention. Completed forms may be submitted to the Book Room for handling or to your congregation secretary upon your return.—See the February 2005 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> p. 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Restaurants: </span><span class="font13">Honor Jehovah’s name by your fine conduct at restaurants. In many places, it is customary to leave a 15 to 20 percent tip, depending on the service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Hotels: </span><span class="font13">(1) Please do not reserve more rooms than will actually be needed, and do not have more people stay in your room than what is allowed. (2) If you must cancel your reservation, notify the hotel immediately. (3) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it, and return it immediately so that others may use it. (4) Do not cook in rooms where cooking is not permitted. (5) Leave a tip for the housekeeper each day. (6) Do not abuse any complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice provisions that are made available for guests to use while they are at the hotel. (7) Display the fruitage of the spirit in dealing with the hotel staff at all times. (8) The room rate shown on the Recommended Lodging List is the full price per day, excluding tax. If you are overcharged or billed for things you did not request or use, refuse these charges and inform the Rooming Department at the convention as soon as possible. (9) If a problem arises with your hotel room, be sure to inform the Rooming Department while at the convention.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>An Occasion to Eat Spiritually and Rejoice</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah lovingly cares for the spiritual needs of his servants. While the world in general is spiritually starved, we eat very well indeed. (Isa. 65:13) One way that Jehovah nourishes us spiritually is through our annual district conventions. Are you making preparations to attend all sessions of the upcoming “Guided by God’s Spirit” District Convention? A tasty and nourishing spiritual banquet has been arranged.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Plan Ahead: </span><span class="font14">“The plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage.” (Prov. 21:5) Therefore, in finalizing your plans to be present all three days of the convention, do not put off speaking with your employer if you need to take time off work. If you will require overnight accommodations, have these been arranged? You will also want to plan your noon meals so that you can eat with your brothers at the convention site. Make arrangements to arrive at the convention early enough each day to find seating and share in the opening song and prayer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> We want to make sure that the clothing we will wear is modest and well arranged. (1 Tim. 2:9,10) District conventions provide an excellent opportunity for us to give a witness to the community. By maintaining a dignified appearance while in the convention city and by wearing our convention badges, we stand out from unbelievers and make a favorable impression upon observers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Listen Carefully: </span><span class="font14">We surely do not want to miss out on any morsel served at this spiritual banquet! (Prov. 22:17,18) Following along in our Bible as texts are read and taking brief notes will help us keep our mind on the program and avoid distraction. Then in the evening, we can use our notes to discuss the highlights of the program with others.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1. How does Jehovah care for the spiritual needs of his servants?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2. Planning ahead for the convention involves what?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">3. What type of clothing should we plan to wear? 4. What will help us and our families get the most from the program?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">In recent years it has been observed that some youths sit together at the convention and converse during the program or engage in text messaging on their cell phones. If we have children, including teenagers, it may be advantageous for us to sit together and listen to the program as a family rather than to allow our young ones to sit apart from us with other youths.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Enjoy Fellowship: </span><span class="font14">A tasty meal is more enjoyable when shared with friends. (Prov. 15:17) Similarly, association with our brothers and sisters heightens our enjoyment of the convention. Therefore, when the program is not in session, how pleasant it is to take the initiative to meet other delegates and enjoy fellowship! (Ps. 133:1) When the chairman kindly invites us to take our seats before the music starts, we should end our conversations and be seated for the beginning of the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Be Alert to Witness: </span><span class="font14">Conventions usually provide excellent opportunities to give a witness. Many conventioners who go to restaurants after the program are asked by waiters and others about the theme shown on the convention badge. This has led to conversations and giving a fine witness to the truth. Some who inquired were then invited to the convention session and attended.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">’Thousands of hours have been spent preparing the program, arranging for facilities, organizing convention departments, and preparing the parts. All the loving labor that has been invested in preparing this spiritual feast indicates Jehovah’s tender care of his people. May all of us be present and eat heartily! As we do, unlike the world, we will “cry out joyfully because of the good condition of the heart.”—Isa. 65:14.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Is it proper for one of Jehovah’s Witnesses to receive treatment and care at a hospital or nursing home operated by a religious organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Various religious organizations operate hospitals or nursing homes that provide medical treatment or long-term care. Generally, such facilities are not established for the outright promotion of Babylon the Great. (Rev. 18:2, 4) They may originally have been incorporated to serve a religious organization as a source of income. Today, some hospitals are religious in their name only, whereas others are still partially staffed by members of the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">If one of Jehovah’s Witnesses requires hospital or nursing care, he must make his own decision as to whether he will go to a facility that may possibly be connected with a religious organization. The conscience of one might permit him to do so, but the conscience of another may prevent him from doing so. (1 Tim. 1:5) There are certain circumstances that may have a bearing on one’s decision, and it is good to consider these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For example, a hospital or nursing home with a religious name may be the only one in the immediate area. Or if there is another facility nearby, the one with possible religious connections may have a reputation for superior service. Such a hospital with a religious name may be the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font14"> one equipped to provide the particular treatment needed, or it may be the only hospital where your doctor or surgeon is able to handle cases. Also, sometimes hospitals with religious connections may respect your viewpoint as a Christian on the use of blood, whereas some other private or municipal hospitals may not. So these are some factors that you may have to consider when deciding what facility to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">If you do decide to use a hospital or nursing home with religious connections, you might view it merely as paying for services rendered. You might view it as if the religious organization were operating a certain business, and in purchasing a service from such a business you would not be making a direct, voluntary contribution to the support of a false religion. You would merely be paying for a product or a service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Of course, as a Christian, in such circumstances you must definitely see to it that you do not engage in any acts of false worship. Also, you would not ascribe the usual religious titles, such as “Father” or “Sister,” to individuals who may work at or visit the facility. (Matt. 23:9) You would have to see to it that the matter is strictly a business arrangement in which you are receiving treatment and service, and nothing more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When being admitted to the hospital, you may indicate that you are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and that you would like to receive visits from local elders. This will ensure that you receive proper spiritual support during your stay.—1 Thess. 5:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Believing family members, local elders, and others in the congregation should responsibly care for the spiritual needs of any elderly brothers and sisters who live in nursing homes, particularly when operated by a religious organization. Diligence in this regard will be of great encouragement to such older ones and will prevent them from inadvertently being included in religious services, celebrations, or other similar activities held at such facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">With these points in mind, each one will have to consider all the circumstances involved and then make his own decision as to which hospital or nursing home he will use—Gal. 6:5.</span></p>

Publishers should consider their needs for such information in advance and call the branch office during regular working hours (on weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and on Saturdays from 8:00 a.m. to 11:55 a.m.). Or some may choose to consult an electronic telephone directory on the Internet.

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Losing a loved one in death is a traumatic experience, especially for those who do not have the Kingdom hope. (1 Thess. 4: 13) Many often wonder: ‘Why do people die? Where do they go? Will I ever see my loved one again?’ Below are some suggestions for giving comfort to those we meet in field service who are mourning the death of a relative or a friend.—Isa. 61:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> From Door to Door: </span><span class="font13">A householder may tell us that he just had a death in his family. Is he in emotional turmoil? Is the house filled with grieving relatives? In such cases, it may be best not to give an extended witness. (Eccl. 3:1, 7) Perhaps we can express our sympathy, give him an appropriate tract, magazine, or brochure, and excuse ourselves. Then we can return at a more suitable time to share further comfort from the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> On other occasions, we may discern that more can be said on the initial call. Though this is not the time to refute wrong views, we may be able to read with them the Bible’s promises regarding the resurrection. (John 5:28, 29) Or we could share what the Bible says about the condition of the dead. (Eccl. 9:5, 10) A Biblical account of a resurrection may also provide comfort. (John 11:39-44) Another option would be to consider the words of hope in Jehovah expressed by faithful Job. (Job 14:14, 15) Before leav-</span></p></li></ul>

Literature that provides comfort could be made available for them. Some funeral homes have appreciated having some appropriate literature on hand for grieving families. At times, funeral notices appearing in the newspaper have opened the way for writing a brief comforting letter to bereaved family members. In one case, after receiving a letter that included some tracts, a widower and his daughter went to the publisher’s home and asked: “Are you the people that sent me this letter? Well, I want to know more about the Bible!” The man and his daughter agreed to a Bible study and began attending congregation meetings.</span></p>

All of us should be alert to recognize appropriate opportunities to comfort those who are grieving the loss of a loved one.</span></p>

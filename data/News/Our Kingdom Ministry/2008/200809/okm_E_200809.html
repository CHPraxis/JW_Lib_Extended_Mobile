<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Q)ear ^Kingdom C^Mx/iecs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An announcement presented during morning worship on Monday, February 4, 2008, brought enthusiastic applause. It read: “Over the past weekend, presiding overseers have arrived from various congregations throughout the United States. They are now at Patterson to attend the first class of the School for Congregation Elders.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Students enjoy upbuilding association with the Bethel family. They also attend morning worship each day, as well as the Bethel family </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> Study on Monday evening. A highlight of the school occurs on the last day when special lectures are delivered by a member of the United States Branch Committee and a member of the Governing Body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many expressions of appreciation have been received from the elders who have attended. One brother commented: “Being at Bethel for a week was so encouraging!” Another wrote: “I now feel heartened to fulfill my responsibilities with a renewed sense of zeal.” The present curriculum covers various aspects of the responsibilities of presiding overseers and will enable them to serve the needs of the congregation more effectively. (Acts 20:28) We rejoice in this loving provision and look forward to meeting the brothers who have yet to attend.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Tract Campaign October 20-November 16!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Beginning on Monday, October 20, and continuing for four full weeks, we will engage in a special distribution of a new tract entitled Would You </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Like to Know the Truth?</span><span class="font9"> It is hoped that this earth-wide special campaign will generate increased interest in the only source of truth.—John 17:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The tract gives concise Bible answers to six important questions: “Does God really care about us?” “Will war and suffering ever end?” “What happens to us when we die?” “Is there any hope for the dead?” “How can I pray and be heard by God?” and “How can I find happiness in life?” The churches of Christendom have never supplied satisfying answers to these questions. Even many who do not profess to be Christian have wondered about such matters, but they may not be aware that clear answers are found in the Bible. Therefore, this message should have wide appeal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Cover Your Territory: </span><span class="font9">Endeavor to cover as much of your house-to-house territory as possible. If you have a large territory, the elders may encourage you to leave a copy of the tract at not-at-homes on the first call. Remember to give a copy to neighbors, relatives, acquaintances at work or school, and others you speak with on a regular basis. Perhaps you can arrange your affairs to auxiliary pioneer in October or November. Do you have a child or a Bible student who is making good spiritual progress and who may qualify to join us in this campaign as an unbaptized publisher? If so, inform the elders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> What to Say: </span><span class="font9">In order to reach more people with the message, it is best to keep your presentation brief. Simply ask householders one of the six questions on the cover and direct them to the answer in the tract. This will allow for all publishers to adapt their presentation to the needs of the territory. If someone indicates interest, make a note of it and call back. On weekends, the current magazines may be offered along with the tract. After the campaign ends on November 16, we will offer the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font9"> book. Any remaining tracts will be used in the same way as other available tracts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Start a Bible Study: </span><span class="font9">This tract has been specifically designed to help us start Bible studies. When making a return visit on someone who showed interest, you might ask which Bible truth brought him comfort or relief? Call attention to the back page where our Bible study arrangement is mentioned, and hand him a copy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font9"> book. If possible, briefly consider a paragraph or two from the chapter that has more information on the subject that he selected.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah is looking for those who will worship him “with spirit and truth.” (John 4:23) May all of us share in this special campaign to help others come to know the truth!</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">■ Since November has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer. ■ The special public talk for the 2009 Memorial season will be given during the week of April 20, 2009. The subject of the talk will be announced later. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer or an assembly that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before April 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> for 2008, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Publications Index 2008,</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Library —2008 Edition</span><span class="font9"> on CD-ROM with their next literature request. A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed each month. Please note that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Library—2008 Edition</span><span class="font9"> is a provision for members of the congregation and is made available only through the congregation. Publishers who make extensive use of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Library</span><span class="font9"> and no longer use bound volumes should consider whether they need to request the bound volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Someone designated by the presiding overseer should audit the congregation’s accounts for the months of June, July, and August. The same person should not be used for consecutive audits. When the audit is complete, an announcement should be made to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.—See </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Instructions for Congregation Accounting</span><span class="font9"> (S-27).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Annual Congregation Property Documents Review Work Sheet</span><span class="font9"> (TO-33) and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Safety Inspection Work Sheet</span><span class="font9"> (TO-34) are to be completed each September. Copies of the completed forms should be promptly provided to the body of elders for each congregation that meets in the Kingdom Hall as well as to the Regional Building Committee. If corrective actions are needed, the elders should care for these. When the circuit overseer visits the congregation, he will review both work sheets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ If you are admitted to a hospital and want visiting local elders and, in larger cities, elders serving on a Patient Visitation Group to have access to your name, what must you do? When identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you should also explain that you are willing to have a minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses visit you. A federal law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), protects your privacy, but with your consent, the law allows for the elders to learn of your admission and provide spiritual encouragement.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Question Box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">■ May both parents report the time used for the regular family study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Although fathers have the primary responsibility of bringing their children up “in the discipline and mentalregulating of Jehovah,” both parents share in training their children. (Eph. 6:4) The Bible encourages children: “Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the law of your mother.” (Prov. 1:8) One Important aspect of parental training is the family Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the past, only the parent </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">conducting</span><span class="font9"> a family study with unbaptized children would report the time, even when both parents were involved in the discussion. However, this is being adjusted. If during the family study both parents share together in teaching the children, then both may count a maximum of one hour a week as field service. Of course, parents generally spend much more than one hour a week teaching their children. Training children involves constant effort on the part of both parents. (Deut. 6:6-9) However, the monthly field service report should reflect primarily what is being accomplished in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">field.</span><span class="font9"> Therefore, no more than one hour a week is to be counted, even if the study lasts longer than an hour, is conducted more than once a week, or separate studies are conducted with the children. Only one parent would report the family Bible study and up to one return visit each week that the study was conducted.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Teach Others to Love Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Do you recall the first time you heard of Jehovah? What was it that drew you to him? Many honesthearted people will tell you that they were drawn close to our Creator on gaining knowledge of his matchless qualities, especially his compassion and love.—1 John 4:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> “This Is Our God”: </span><span class="font9">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font9"> book underscores Jehovah’s love and the need to have a personal relationship with him. How can we use this publication to teach others to grow in their love for God? When focusing on a new point, we could ask heartsearching questions, such as: “What does this truth reveal about Jehovah?” or “In what way does this point give evidence that Jehovah is the best Father anyone could want?” Teaching in this way can help the student begin a lifelong relationship with Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> When we help Bible students appreciate what a privilege it is to be taking in knowledge of the only true and living God, they will come to acknowledge, as in the words of Isaiah, “this is our God.&quot; (Isa. 25:9) When explaining God’s Word, we need to emphasize how mankind will be blessed by the fulfillment of Jehovah’s purposes through his royal government under Christ Jesus.—Isa. 9:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Evidence of Love for Jehovah: </span><span class="font9">We know that loving Jehovah with one’s whole heart, soul, and mind involves more than simply having strong feelings toward God. We must come to adopt and adhere to his way of thinking. (Ps. 97:10) Love for 1. What draws some to Jehovah? 2, 3. How can we use the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font9"> book to help Bible students to grow in their love for Jehovah?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">4, 5. What does love of Jehovah mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God is made manifest by strictly obeying his commandments and continuing to engage in “holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion,” even in the face of trials and opposition. —2 Pet. 3:11; 2 John 6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Doing God’s will out of love for him is a pleasure. (Ps. 40:8) The Bible student must come to appreciate that all of God’s commandments are designed for the everlasting good of His servants. (Deut. 10:12, 13) By living in harmony with Jehovah’s guidance, a person demonstrates deep appreciation for all His wonderful works.

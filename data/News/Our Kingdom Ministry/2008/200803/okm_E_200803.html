<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We Can Give to Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Did you know that humans are able to give something to God? Abel sacrificed some of his precious livestock to Jehovah, and Noah and Job made similar offerings. (Gen. 4:4; 8: 20; Job 1:5) Of course, such offerings did not enrich the Creator in any way, since he already possesses everything. But the sacrifices did demonstrate the deep love those faithful men had for God. Today, we can use our time, energy, and resources in giving Jehovah “a sacrifice of praise.”—Heb. 13:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Time: </span><span class="font10">How commendable it is to ‘buy out’ time from less important things to share more fully in the ministry! (Eph. 5:15, 16) Perhaps we could adjust our schedule in order to auxiliary pioneer one or more months a year. Maybe we could lengthen the time we usually spend in the ministry. Staying out an extra 30 minutes each week would increase our ministry by at least two hours a month!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Energy: </span><span class="font10">Having energy to use in the ministry requires that we avoid recreation and employment that leave us so tired that we cannot give Jehovah our best. We also need to put aside anxieties that could make our heart “bow down,” robbing us of energy that we could use in serving God. (Prov. 12:25) Even if we have a legitimate concern, how much better it is to ‘throw our burden upon Jehovah’!—Ps. 55:22; Phil. 4:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Resources: </span><span class="font10">We can also give of our material resources to support the preaching work. Paul encouraged fellow Christians to “set something aside” regularly so as to have something to give to those in need. (1 Cor. 16:1, 2) In a similar way, we may be able to set aside funds to donate for local congregation needs as well as for the worldwide work. Jehovah appreciates what we give from the heart, even if it is just a little—Luke 21:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah has given us much. (Jas. 1:17) We show our appreciation by giving generously of our time, energy, and other resources to serve him. Our doing so pleases Jehovah, “for God loves a cheerful giver.”—2 Cor. 9:7.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Building One Another Up While in the Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> All of us appreciate receiving an encouraging “word spoken at the right time.” (Prov. 25: 11) When we work with others in the ministry, how can we make sure that our conversation results in encouragement?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Upbuilding Conversation: </span><span class="font10">How upbuilding it is to include spiritual matters in our conversation while engaging in the preaching work! (Ps. 37:30) We could talk about our presentation or relate encouraging field service experiences we recently enjoyed. (Acts 15:3) Did we glean an interesting point from our personal Bible reading, the recent magazines, or a congregation meeting? We might discuss points presented in a public talk we recently heard at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> We may feel disheartened when a householder raises an objection that we are unable to overcome. It would be beneficial for us to take a few minutes after leaving the door to consider with our partner how such a situation might be handled in the future, perhaps by consulting the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book. And if we appreciated something about our partner’s presentation, a word of sincere commendation would provide welcome encouragement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Take the Initiative: </span><span class="font10">Are there some in our book study group with whom we have not worked recently? Extending a personal invitation to accompany us in the ministry may result in “an interchange of encouragement.” (Rom. 1:12) Regular and auxiliary pioneers appreciate having others to work with, especially in the early morning or late afternoon, when fewer publishers may be sharing in the ministry. We can support the pioneers by making ourselves available. Is there an infirm publisher whose health limits what he is able to do in the ministry? Arranging for such a one to accompany us, perhaps on a Bible study, may be beneficial.—Prov. 27:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Commendation and expressions of appreciation are always encouraging, even in small matters. We should have that in mind when working with others in the ministry, since we want to “keep . . . building one another up.”—1 Thess. 5:11.</span></p>

April and May: The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazines. A special effort will be made to visit newly interested ones who attended the Memorial or the special public talk but who are not actively associated with the congregation. The purpose of such visits should be to start a home Bible study with those who have not yet accepted one. June: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What Does the Bible Really Teach?</span><span class="font9"> Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Congregations should release the latest issues of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> as soon as they are received. This will allow publishers to become familiar with the contents before offering the magazines in field service. ■ Someone designated by the presiding overseer should audit the congregation’s accounts for the months of December, January, and February. The same person should not be used for consecutive audits. When the audit is complete, an announcement should be made to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.—See </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Instructions for Congregation Accounting</span><span class="font9"> (S-27).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ The theme for the 2008 district conventions is “Guided by God’s Spirit.” The April issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> will furnish helpful detailed information for finalizing your personal plans for attending all sessions of this three-day convention. If you need to request time off from your employment in order to be present all three days, do not hesitate to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Immediately after the Memorial, the total attendance and number of partakers should be submitted to the branch office using the jw.org Web site. If this is not possible, a letter may be sent. When multiple congregations meet together, only one congregation should submit the total attendance figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ It is important that groups of 20 or more planning to visit the United States branch office facilities at Brooklyn. Patterson, and Wallkill first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204. You may also use the following fax number: (845) 306-0200. At least two weeks prior to visiting, please send information on the number coming and the dates and times for visiting each location. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Lodging information may be obtained from the congregation secretary.</span><span class="font9"> Before your visit, please review the Question Box in this issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> regarding proper dress and grooming when visiting Bethel homes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ What type of clothing is appropriate when visiting facilities used for Jehovah’s service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Around the world, Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls, Bethel homes, and branch facilities stand out as places dedicated to Jehovah’s service. They are modest, clean, and well-arranged, reflecting dignity in appearance. The contrast with what is often seen in Satan’s system of things is great indeed. Those who visit places used for Jehovah’s service should also be recognized as belonging to Jehovah, ones who are doing his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As Christians, we “recommend ourselves as God’s ministers” in every way, including our appropriate, well-arranged dress and grooming. (2 Cor. 6: 3, 4) We are also expected to maintain proper decorum. At all times our dress and grooming should reflect the decency and dignity that befit servants of Jehovah God. This is especially true when visiting the headquarters facilities in New York as well as the branches around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In discussing the importance of proper dress and grooming, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will</span><span class="font10"> comments on the need for physical cleanness, modest dress, and good grooming when we engage in the field ministry and attend Christian meetings. Then, on page 138, paragraph 3, it states: “Remember, the name Bethel means ‘House of God.’ Therefore, our dress, grooming, and conduct should be similar to what is expected of us when attending meetings for worship at the Kingdom Hall.” This high standard should be observed by Kingdom publishers visiting Bethel from the local area as well as those from more distant places. In this way, the visitor demonstrates appropriate appreciation and respect. —Ps. 29:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our clothing should identify us as those “professing to reverence God.” (1 Tim. 2:10) Appropriate dress and grooming have a positive influence on the way others view the true worship of Jehovah. However, it has been noted that when visiting facilities used for Jehovah’s service, a few brothers and sisters tend to be extremely casual, sloppy, or revealing in their dress. Such attire is not appropriate for Christians at any time. In this matter, as in all other aspects of our Christian life, we desire to maintain the high standards that distinguish God’s people from the world, doing all things for God’s glory.—Rom. 12:2; 1 Cor. 10:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So when visiting the headquarters and branch in New York State or other branch facilities, whether on a planned visit or while on vacation in tourist areas, ask yourself: ‘Does my dress and grooming reflect the modesty, the cleanliness, and the dignity of the place I will be visiting? Does it reflect well on the God that I worship? Would others be distracted or offended by my appearance?’ By our dress and grooming, may we always “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things”!—Titus 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> On March 22, 2008, millions of people around the world will receive a powerful witness. Those attending the Memorial will hear about Jehovah’s great love in providing a ransom for mankind. (John 3:16) They will learn about the Kingdom and how Jehovah will use it to accomplish his will for all the earth. (Matt. 6:9, 10) They will see firsthand the love and unity of God’s people and experience our warm hospitality.—Ps. 133:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Bible Students: </span><span class="font10">Some in attendance will be those who have just started studying the Bible with us. Introduce them to the brothers and sisters. Explain the weekly meetings, and give them a brief tour of the Kingdom Hall. During the talk, the speaker will encourage such ones to continue making spiritual progress. You can use his comments as a basis to encourage your students.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Inactive: </span><span class="font10">Some attending will be inactive publishers. Take the initiative to greet them warmly. Avoid asking personal questions or making statements that may cause embarrassment. Shortly after the Memorial, the elders should visit any inactive ones who attended, commend them for their efforts to attend, and warmly invite them to the next congregation meeting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Visitors: </span><span class="font10">Some of those pres-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. What powerful witness will be given on March 22, 2008?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. How may we assist Bible students who are present?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. What can be done to encourage inactive publishers who are in attendance?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. How may each of us help visitors?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">ent may be acquaintances or family members whom we personally invited. Others may have received an invitation during the special campaign. If you see individuals you do not recognize, take the initiative to introduce yourself and welcome them. It may be that they have not attended one of our meetings before. In your conversation you may be able to find out how to contact them. By a personal visit or a brief telephone call a few days after the Memorial, you could try to cultivate further interest and offer a Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The information in the Memorial talk can be used as a basis for introducing the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font10"> book on a return visit. For example, the Memorial speaker will read Isaiah 65:21-23. On the return visit, you might mention the talk and say, “Let me show you other blessings the ransom makes possible.” Then consider pages 4-5 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach </span><span class="font10">book. Or you could say, “Many wonder when we will experience the fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy.” Then consider paragraphs 1-3 in chapter 9. Another option is simply to refer to the Memorial speaker’s comments, introduce the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font10"> book, and demonstrate the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> May each of us be alert to opportunities to assist Bible students, inactive publishers, and visitors who will be in attendance. (Luke 22:19) Jehovah will surely bless any increased activity in our Kingdom service.</span></p></li></ul>

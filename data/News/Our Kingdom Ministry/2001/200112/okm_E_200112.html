<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When witnessing to an official, “Philip opened his mouth and, starting with [a certain] Scripture, he declared to him the good news about Jesus.” (Acts 8:35) Philip was “handling the word of the truth aright.” (2 Tim. 2:15) Today, however, traveling overseers have observed that many publishers rarely use the Bible when witnessing. Do you use the Bible in your ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> God’s Word is the source of everything we believe and teach. (2 Tim. 3:16,17) It is what draws people to Jehovah and educates them for life. That is why it is important that we use the Bi-x—hie in our ministry rather than erely converse about topics chat interest us. (Heb. 4:12) Because most people know little about the Bible, we need to read from it to show them the practical guidance that it offers and the future that it holds out for mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Read Directly From the Bi</span><span class="font13">ble: You might try going to the door without a book bag. You could put the featured literature that you wish to offer in a slim portfolio and carry the Bible in your hand or pocket. Then, when you engage someone in conversation, you can bring out the Bible without causing the person to feel that you are trying to preach a sermon. Position yourself in such a way that your listener can follow along in your Bible. Perhaps ask him to read a verse aloud. A deeper impression is made when he can see what the Bible says rather than just hear it from you. Of course, to help him understand the point of the text, stress the thoughtconveying words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> A One-Scripture Presentation: </span><span class="font13">After introducing yourself, you might say: “People look to various sources for direction in their lives. What do you feel is the best source of practical guidance? [Allow for response.] What do you think about this statement? [Read Proverbs 2: 6,7, and allow for response.] Human wisdom has proved woefully deficient, leading many people to despair. God’s wisdom, though, has always proved reliable and beneficial.” Then show the publication you are presenting, and highlight from it one example of God’s practical wisdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Jesus used the Scriptures to aid honesthearted ones. (Luke 24:32) Paul proved Scriptural-ly the things he taught. (Acts 17:2, 3) Our confidence and joy in the ministry will increase as we become ever more skillful in handling God’s Word aright.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The ability to speak is taken for granted by most people. However, speech is a gift from Jehovah. It allows us to communicate with others and to express our thoughts and feelings. Foremost, with it we can praise our God.—Ps. 22:22; 1 Cor. 1:4-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Men, women, and children are trained in the Theocratic Ministry School to declare Jehovah’s name. (Ps. 148:12, 13) The school program for 2002 covers a wide range of Bible subjects that we can personally benefit from and use in the ministry. By preparing for the school and participating in it, we can increase our knowledge and our skills as teachers of God’s Word.—Ps. 45:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Read the Bible Daily: </span><span class="font13">If we usually have a Bible close at hand, we can take advantage of any free time that we have to read it. Most of us have a few spare minutes during the day that we could use in this way. How beneficial it is to read at least one page every day, which is all that it takes to keep up with the Bible-reading program outlined in the school schedule! —Ps. 1:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The ability to read the Bible well can help us to reach the heart of our listeners and motivate them to praise Jehovah. The brothers who handle Assignment No. 2 in the school should practice, practice, practice reading the assignment aloud. The school overseer will offer commendation and suggestions to improve the reading.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Ose the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book: </span><span class="font13">Assignments No. 3 and No. 4 are based on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book. Most of us could probably be more conscious of using this practical aid in the field ministry. The sisters should choose settings that are practical for the territory. The school overseer should pay particular attention to how they teach and make use of the Scriptures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> May the Theocratic Ministry School help all of us to continue using our God-given gift of speech to declare the good news and to praise our great God, Jehovah!—Ps. 34:1; Eph. 6:19.</span></p>

A copy of the Recommended Lodging List should be made available by the conductor so that those in attendance can copy the hotel telephone numbers for making their reservations. However, copies of this list should not be given to anyone.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’” (Ps. 122:1) In examining the psalmist’s expression, note (1) how he felt when he was invited to join in worshiping Jehovah, (2) the good associates he had, who were also keenly interested in true worship, and (3) the planning that must have been needed to extend the invitation, to gather together, and to make the journey to God’s house.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Do not the psalmist’s words echo our own feelings when we hear that plans are being made for our next convention? We are filled with anticipation as we recall the joys of past conventions and the prospect of again being at a special gathering with fellow lovers of Jehovah. Arrangements have been made for three-day “Zealous Kingdom Proclaim-ers” District Conventions throughout the United '&quot;-'States branch territory m 2002. Now is the time to make our plans to attend and to receive the fullest benefit from the spiritual feast awaiting us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> “The faithful steward, the discreet one,” has begun preparing the timely spiritual food to be served at the convention. (Luke 12:42) Each congregation has been assigned to a specific convention so that overcrowding at each venue and in the area hotels can be avoided. In addition, many brothers have started to organize the various convention departments so that “all things take place decently and by arrangement.” (1 Cor. 14:40) With so many things already in place for our benefit and convenience, what can we personally do to prepare for the convention?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Plan Wow to Attend A90 Three Days: </span><span class="font13">Do you need to ask your employer for time off to attend all of your assigned convention? Jehovah understands that some employers are “hard to please.” (1 Pet. 2:18) But our conventions are very important, and we want to make a diligent effort to attend the entire program. Approach Jehovah in prayer about such matters, seeking his guidance for a good outcome.—Neh. 2:4.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Use the Recommended Lodging List to Make Your Hotel! Arrangements: </span><span class="font13">By the time this information is discussed at the Service Meeting, your congregation will have received the Recommended Lodging List for your convention. Call hotels from this list, and make your reservations using the step-by-step procedure in the box on page 4, “How to Make Your Hotel Reservation.” A maximum of four adults is permitted per room unless indicated otherwise on the list. Accept only the rates shown, as that is what the hotels have agreed to charge our delegates. If a hotel attempts to charge you more than the listed rate or indicates that there are any added charges you must pay (aside from applicable taxes), do not accept the higher rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Some publishers, without consulting the current Recommended Lodging List, may call a hotel and ask if they have rates for our convention. The hotel may assure them that it does have a rate for Jehovah’s Witnesses, even though for good reason the hotel is not on our list. Rather than call a hotel to see if they have special rates, please check the list </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">first.</span><span class="font13"> If you plan to attend a convention in a different city, obtain the Recommended Lodging List for that convention. The congregation secretary can provide you with the address of the convention headquarters located on the reverse side of the Special Needs Room Request form. Enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope with your request. If there is more than one convention held in that city, be sure to indicate the dates of the convention you will attend.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Through your congregation secretary, please inform the Rooming Department of any problems you encounter. (Be sure that you have called </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font13"> the hotels on the Recommended Lodging List before informing the secretary that there are no rooms available.) The address and telephone number of your convention’s Rooming Department may be found at the top of the first page of your Recommended Lodging List.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Look Around fthe Congregation: </span><span class="font13">If we are aware that a brother or a sister has a physical or material need that may make it difficult for him or her to attend the convention, can we “widen out” in our love and provide some assistance? (2 Cor. 6:12,13; Deut. 15:7) This is the spirit Paul encouraged at 2 Corinthians 8:14. Why not invite such ones to travel with you to the convention? If they are pioneers, likely they have many good experiences to share along the way. If they are older members of the congregation, they may have a wonderful theocratic history that you have never heard. Would not association with these brothers and sisters be a good influence on you and your family? Your generous spirit will be appreciated by them and rewarded by Jehovah.—Prov. 28:27; Matt. 10:42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Although those with special needs are primarily cared for by their Christian relatives, the elders and others in the congregation who are aware of such needs can lovingly assist in making arrangements. (1 Tim. 5:4) When Special Needs Room Request forms are submitted to the Congregation Service Committee, the committee should review each applicant’s qualifications before forwarding these forms to the Rooming Department. The congregation secretary should include his telephone number on the form so that the Rooming Department can contact him if there are any questions. Mail the approved forms to the convention address shown on the reverse side of the form.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Respond Willingly as a Volunteer: </span><span class="font13">During the convention, hundreds of volunteers assist with the smooth running of the departments. Attendants in the auditorium and the parking lots provide direction for seating and watch over our vehicles during the day. The Cleaning Department has the privilege of upholding our fine reputation for cleanliness, leaving our temporary place of worship cleaner than we found it. Can we assist these or other departments that can use our support? Will you volunteer your help to serve “shoulder to shoulder” with your brothers?—Zeph. 3:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Do People Really Notice What We Do? </span><span class="font13">During a district convention this past year, a man who had stopped studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses over 20 years ago was working in a hotel. He related to some Witnesses that he was now thinking of resuming his Bible study and going back to the meetings. Why? Because of the loving way he was treated during the days the Witnesses were at the hotel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> A hotel salesperson said of our brothers: “Your group is the best one that stays at our hotels. Your people are so patient and polite.” How proud this must make our heavenly Father as he sees us following Jesus’ admonition: “Let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens”!—Matt. 5:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> May we reflect the attitude of King David, who joyfully anticipated going to Jehovah’s house of worship. Our district conventions are a vital source of spiritual food and an unequaled opportunity for loving fellowship. Therefore, we enthusiastically invite you to begin making your arrangements to attend </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">all sessions of all three days</span><span class="font13"> of this year’s “Zealous Kingdom Proclaim-ers” District Convention!</span></p></li></ul>

Those who have the goal of becoming missionaries. Why? To familiarize themselves with the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. The video marked the 50th anniversary of this unique school, which was created to expand the witness work to “all the ends of the earth.” (Ps. 22: 27) Watching it will increase your appreciation for the all-important work of preaching the good news and will stir you to increased activity.

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> In last month’s part on this subject, we highlighted four ways that our appreciation for Jehovah’s love can be shown in the ministry. (1 John 4:9-11) Here we will add five more ways to do this. When we share fully in helping others spiritually, we are blessed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WV</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Informal Witnessing: </span><span class="font13">This is an effective way both to find people hungering and thirsting for righteousness and to place helpful literature with them. It is good to ‘buy out the opportune time’ and witness on all occasions and to whomever we meet. (Eph. 5:16) We may have to muster up courage to witness in this way, but if we appreciate God’s love and people’s needs, we will witness at every opportunity.—-2 Tim. 1:7, 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> A missionary was richly blessed for striking up a conversation with a fellow passenger in a taxicab. The man showed interest. Return visits were made, and a Bible study was started. That man came into the truth and progressed to the point of becoming a congregation elder!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Writing Letters: </span><span class="font13">Perhaps we are unable to go from house to house because of some physical infirmity or inclement weather. We could write letters, giving a brief witness by mail to individuals we know, those who have lost loved ones in death, or those who were not at home in the territory. We can enclose one of our timely tracts that has an appealing Bible-based message and encourages the recipient to respond if he has any questions. Use your personal return address or that of the Kingdom Hall; please do not use the branch office address.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Telephone Witnessing: </span><span class="font13">This is a fine way to reach people whom we are unable to meet in house-to-house activity. If we do it discreetly, with kindness, tact, and skill, we may get a very good response. The February 2001 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> pages 5-6, provides practical suggestions on how to get the best results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> When a sister was witnessing by telephone, she asked a woman whether she had given much thought to what the future holds for her and her family. The woman said that she had. She revealed that because of her despair, she had isolated herself at home. Moved by the genuine concern of the sister, the woman agreed to meet her at a nearby market. As a result, the woman readily accepted a Bible study!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Welcoming Strangers: </span><span class="font13">If we love our neighbors, we will be alert to notice any stranger who visits our meeting place and will make him feel welcome. (Rom. 15:7) Let him see that he is among those who are sincerely interested in his spiritual wellbeing. Our genuine concern and our offer of a personal Bible study may motivate him to accept our help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Our Good Conduct: </span><span class="font13">By our fine conduct, we adorn the truth. (Titus 2:10) When those in the world say good things about us as Jehovah’s Witnesses, they bring honor to our God.

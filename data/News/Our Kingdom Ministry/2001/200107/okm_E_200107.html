<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Don’t Hold Back!</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> When we get ready to go preaching from door to door, the most challenging door we encounter may be our own. Feelings of inadequacy may hold us back from getting out to speak the truth to “all sorts of men.” (1 Tim. 2:4) But we should not feel hesitant to preach the good news. Why not?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> It Is Jehovah’s Message: </span><span class="font0">Jehovah has communicated his word through the Bible. When we take this message to others, we are conveying his thoughts, not ours. (Rom. 10:13-15) When individuals reject the Kingdom message, they are really rejecting Jehovah. Yet, we are not discouraged. We are confident that this message will strike a responsive chord in the hearts of those who long for a change in world conditions and who are conscious of their spiritual need.—Ezek. 9:4; Matt. 5:3, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah Draws the People: </span><span class="font0">A person who refused to listen to us in the past may now be receptive because his circumstances have changed and his heart condition has softened. Jehovah may now express his goodwill toward that one and ‘draw him.’ (John 6:44, 65) When this happens, we want to be ready to be used by Jehovah and yield to angelic direction in finding such ones.—Rev. 14:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> God Gives Us His Spirit: </span><span class="font0">Holy spirit enables us to speak “with boldness by the authority of Jehovah.” (Acts 14:1-3) Remembering that we have this powerful backing in our ministry, we will not be reluctant to speak the truth to neighbors, workmates, classmates, relatives, or well-educated or wealthy people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Jesus Taught Us How: </span><span class="font0">Jesus used thought-provoking questions, down-to-earth illustrations, and Scriptural reasoning. He explained the truth in a simple, appealing way, from his heart. These are still the best methods today. (1 Cor. 4:17) The settings in which we preach may vary, but the powerful Kingdom message remains the same.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> We are privileged to be used by Jehovah to help people in a unique and vital way. Let us not hold back! May we be courageous and allow Jehovah to “open a door of utterance to us” so that we can speak the good news to others.—Col. 4:2-4.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7">Get Ready to Study Isaiah’s Prophecy!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> “Faithful worshipers can be confident that Jehovah . . . will not allow Satan’s world to exist for one day longer than justice requires.” What an encouraging statement! From where was it quoted? </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Isaiah’s Prophecy —Light for All Mankind I.</span><span class="font0"> Does the prophecy of Isaiah give us reason to draw such a heartening conclusion? Yes! In that Bible book, the theme of salvation comes through loud and clear. (Isa. 25:9) That is why it will be of great encouragement for us to study this portion of God’s Word at the Congregation Book Study. Will we be there to enjoy it every week? Why should we?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> At Isaiah 30:20, Jehovah is called our “Grand Instructor.” Each Christian should listen carefully as Jehovah speaks to us through the pages of his Word and through Bible-based publications provided by “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Matt. 24:45; Isa. 48:17, 18) This certainly is true of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Isaiah’s Prophecy I </span><span class="font0">book. How can you get the most out of studying it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Prepare to Participate: </span><span class="font0">Set aside ample time each week to prepare for the book study. Read the assigned material paragraph by paragraph. Think about each of the printed questions. Mark the answers in your book. Verses quoted from Isaiah are printed in bold type. Read them carefully. As for the other scriptures that are cited, look them up to see how they relate to the material. Meditate on what you are learning. Then share the results of your preparation with your book study group.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> The brother who conducts the book study should help all in attendance to make good use of the Bible and to appreciate the practical value of the material being covered. If you are called on first to comment, give a simple, direct answer. If someone has already done that, you can build on the point under discussion. Perhaps you could show how a key scripture supports the theme. Try to comment in your own words, and enjoy the pleasure of participating in the discussion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> Let us eagerly examine together the precious message in the book of Isaiah. It will encourage us to live each day in joyful expectation of Jehovah’s salvation!—Isa. 30:18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font10">Youths—Calculate the Cost of Your Career. A father and his teenage son or daughter approach an elder who has practical experience in secular employment. After reflecting on the Service Meeting part two weeks ago about choosing a career, the youth is thinking seriously about entering the regular pioneer service but is uncertain about how to care for his or her material needs. Elder stresses the need for a balanced view. (September 1,1999, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font10">page 11, paragraph 13) It is wise to seek some type of training so as to be equipped to provide for oneself. Many have done well simply by learning basic skills that require a minimum investment of time and money. (February 1,1996, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> page 14; </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask,</span><span class="font10"> page 178) Together they discuss the March 8, 1996, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font10">pages 9-11, and some practical suggestions on finding or creating suitable secular work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?</span><span class="font10"> Audience discussion and demonstration. Examine this, brochure, and discuss how it can be used to inform others about us and our work. It identifies who we are (pages 3-5), highlights some of our modern history and activities (pages 6-11), lists beliefs that distinguish us from other religions (pages 12-14), explains the good news that we preach and how we preach it (pages 15-21), shows how our work benefits the community (pages 22-4), gives the international scope of our organization (pages 25-6), and answers questions commonly asked about us (pages 27-31). Demonstrate a publisher using the brochure to answer one of the questions on page 29 that is asked by a curious householder, after which the publisher extends the invitation on the back cover. Encourage all to use the brochure to familiarize nonWitness relatives about us, to develop interest on return visits, and to direct Bible students to the organization. Song 50 and concluding prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font10">Youths—Be Discerning in Planning Your Education. An elder talks to some parents and their teenage children about supplementary education. The elder takes the lead in discussing the September 1, 1999, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> pages 16-17, paragraphs 11-13, emphasizing the reasons why the full-time ministry should be high on their list of priorities. (December 1, 1996, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> pages 18-19, paragraphs 13-15) The group then reviews the counsel in the March 8,1998, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font10"> pages 20-1, stressing the need to exercise discernment in weighing the benefits and the drawbacks of supplementary education and limiting it to what is needed to support oneself while zealously pursuing the ministry. All agree that they should be guided by Jesus’ admonition to put Kingdom interests first.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit Assembly Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">One definition of fear is “profound reverence and awe, especially toward God.” This describes the healthy fear referred to in the Scriptures as “the beginning of wisdom.” (Ps. 111:10) In contrast, another kind of fear dominates Satan’s world around us. How can we avoid that unwholesome feeling while developing a reverential fear of Jehovah? The new circuit assembly program for the 2002 service year addresses this question. The theme is “Fear God and Give Him Glory.” (Rev. 14:7) We will come to appreciate the many ways that fear of Jehovah benefits us as individuals and as an organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although fear may imply anxiety or loss of courage and reluctance to face difficult situations, the Bible states: “Happy is everyone fearing Jehovah.” (Ps. 128:1) The assembly program will show us how we can successfully meet the challenges to true worship. We will see how to help new ones cultivate such wholesome fear of God, which will actually motivate them to want to serve him with their whole heart, soul, mind, and strength. (Mark 12:30) The first day concludes with the district overseer’s talk “Draw Ever Closer to Those You Love.” He will explain how we can stay alert to the devilish effort to turn us away from Jehovah, our family, and our Christian brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Fear Jehovah, Not Men” is the theme of a four-part symposium on the second day. It will explain why and how we must overcome any fear that hinders us from fully accomplishing our ministry or maintaining our integrity and good conscience at school and in the workplace. The public address “Fear God and Keep His Commandments” is based on the chain of events described in Revelation chapter 14. The circuit assembly will conclude with positive direction to “Keep On Walking in the Fear of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The. Theocratic Ministry School, model Service Meeting, baptism talk, and summary of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> Study are additional highlights of the program that you will not want to miss. Invite your Bible students to attend with you. Any who wish to be baptized should tell the presiding overseer as soon as possible. All of us will want to demonstrate our wholesome fear of Jehovah and ascribe glory to him by not missing any part of this outstanding program!</span></p>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Have you ever contemplated moving to where there is a need for more Kingdom proclaim ers? If invited to “step over . . . and help,” would you respond as did the apostle Paul? (Acts 16:9, 10) In many congregations, there is a need for spiritually mature families, pioneers to help cover the territory, or qualified elders and ministerial servants to help take the lead. The territory may be made up of small isolated towns scattered throughout large rural areas. The nearest Kingdom Hall might be many miles away. Secular work may be limited. The weather may not always be ideal. Would you be willing to take on such a challenge? How is it possible to make a success of it?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Faith and Trust Needed: </span><span class="font0">At God’s direction, Abram left his hometown of Ur and traveled 600 miles to Haran along with his wife, nephew, and aged father, Terah. (Gen. 11:31, 32; Neh. 9:7) After Terah died, Jehovah commanded Abram, now 75 years old, to leave Haran and his relatives and travel to a country that God would show him. Abram, Sarai, and Lot “got on their way.” (Gen. 12:1, 4, 5) Of course, Abram did not move in order to serve where there was a greater need for ministers. But his move required something. What?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> It took faith and trust for Abram to attempt such an undertaking. His thinking and way of living had to change. He had to leave the security of his relatives. But he trusted Jehovah to look after him and his household. Many today have manifested their trust in Jehovah in a similar way.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Short-Term Assignments: </span><span class="font0">Have you ever enjoyed the rich blessings that come from working unassigned territory? Last year in the 48 contiguous states, 5,699 publishers covered 163 out of 174 unassigned territories. Another 5,676 publishers assisted 380 congregations to cover seldom-worked territory.' For some, this involved traveling great distances. Was it worth the effort?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> A brother from California who went to Utah wrote: “When I was first approached with the idea of taking a group out in seldom-worked territory, I was hesitant. But I decided to accept the assignment. Not only have I never regretted it but it has changed my life. I thank Jehovah every day for the privilege of being a part of this trip.” A brother from Florida who went to Tennessee said that it was the most memorable experience of his 20 years in the truth! A teenager from Connecticut who went to West Virginia said: “This was the best experience of my life!” Most publishers agree that serving for even a short time where the need is greater has deepened their appreciation for the ministry. Talk to those who have done it. You will find that they were uplifted spiritually and would likely do it again if given the opportunity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> Accepting a temporary assignment to serve where the need is greater can serve another purpose. Those doing so can acquire useful information to help them “calculate the expense” of relocating to another part of the country.—Luke 14:28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah is determined to have the good news declared “in all the inhabited earth” before the end comes. (Matt. 24: 14) Knowing this, if you are able, would you be willing to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">move</span><span class="font0"> to where the need is greater? The need exists in many areas.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Moving Where the Need Is Greater: </span><span class="font0">Are you retired? Do you have a steady income? If not, can you arrange for selfemployment? Are you able to make a living from any location by means of the telephone or the computer? If you cannot move, could you assist a family member to serve elsewhere?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>9</sup> If after prayerful consideration you feel equal to the challenge of relocating to where the need is greater, discuss the mqtter with your family and the elders in your congregation. Then, prepare a letter and give it to the elders so that they may include their observations and recommendations before sending it to the branch office.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> What should you include in your letter? Your age, date of baptism, responsibilities in the congregation, marital status, and whether you have minor children. Name the states in which you prefer to serve, according to your personal needs. For instance, can you live where it is hot and humid? Can you endure cold winters? Are you able to live at high altitudes? Do you speak any foreign languages?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>11</sup> Do you have zeal and initiative? Do your circumstances permit you to serve where the need is greater? If so, then observe how Jehovah continuously pours out rich blessings upon those who trust in him as they display the spirit of selfsacrifice!—Ps. 34:8; Mal. 3:10.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">You Are “a Theatrical Spectacle”!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul wrote: “We have become a theatrical spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.” (1 Cor. 4:9) What does this mean, and how should it affect us in our ministry today?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> To a Corinthian, the expression “a theatrical spectacle” likely brought to mind the closing event of a Roman gladiatorial contest, in which condemned people were paraded in front of thousands of spectators before being brutally slaughtered. Similarly, a vast audience—both men and angels—observed the sufferings to which first-century Christians were subjected for bearing witness to the Kingdom. (Heb. 10: 32, 33) Their integrity-keeping course affected more than a few onlookers, just as our endurance does in the modern-day arena. To whom are we a spectacle?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> To the World and to Men: </span><span class="font11">Sometimes the media publish reports about the activities of Jehovah’s people. While we appreciate good reports that are factual and fair in dealing with our work, we also expect bad reports to be spread by our detractors from time to time. Nevertheless, we must continue recommending ourselves as God’s ministers “through bad report and good report.” (2 Cor. 6:4, 8) To honesthearted observers it becomes clear that we are the true disciples of Jesus Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> To Angels: </span><span class="font11">Spirit creatures also observe us. The Devil and his demons watch—but with “great anger,” seeking to halt “the work of bearing witness to Jesus.” (Rev. 12:9, 12, 17) Faithful angels of God watch and rejoice when even one sinner repents. (Luke 15:10) It should strengthen us to know that the angels view our ministry as the most urgent, beneficial work being done on earth today!—Rev. 14:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> When you encounter opposition or think that your ministry is not getting results, remember that you are the center of universal attention. Your faithful endurance speaks volumes. Eventually, your ‘fine fight of faith’ will enable you to ‘get a firm hold on everlasting life.’ —1 Tim. 6:12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">How Important Is Christian Fellowship?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">y..?•</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “No man is an island.” That statement by a 17th-century poet merely echoes what the Bible says about a basic human need—fellowship. (Prov. 18:1) Our Christian association fills this need. In what beneficial ways?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> In the Ministry: </span><span class="font11">One of the foremost benefits is the way our brothers strengthen and support us in the public ministry. Jesus sent his disciples “two by two” to preach. (Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1) In line with this pattern, when we work with others in the field service, we experience the truthfulness of Ecclesiastes 4:9, 10. As we carry out our ministry together, the faith, obedience, and love of our companions infuse us with courage and renew our zeal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> For Personal Help: </span><span class="font11">Our brotherhood is also a source of encouragement and guidance for coping with pressures and resisting temptations. Our Christian associates may call to our attention scriptures that address our personal concerns. They may even pray in our behalf, just as we do for them. (2 Cor. 1:11) And certainly their good example motivates us in right works and strengthens us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> At the Meetings: </span><span class="font11">The blessing of Christian fellowship is enjoyed when we regularly attend congregation meetings. (Heb. 10:24, 25) The program is rich in spiritual instruction, and our presence at the meetings keeps us close to our fellow believers. These gatherings give us opportunity to hear our brothers and sisters express their faith, whether from the platform or from the audience. (Rom. 1:12) Our bond of fellowship deepens as we visit before and after meetings. Such occasions afford us opportunities to relate our own faith-building experiences. Our personalities are affected in a positive way when we associate freely with those who love Jehovah, his Word, his work, and his people.—Phil. 2:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> We need our Christian associates. Without them, walking on the cramped road leading to life would be more difficult. With their love and encouragement, however, we can continue on toward Jehovah’s righteous new world.—Matt. 7:14.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Good Manners—A Trait of Godly People</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Good manners are rare today. Why is that? People are in,such a hurry that they may seldom think of basic courtesies, such as saying “Please,” “Thank you,” or “Excuse me.” God’s Word foretold a worsening of manners in the last days when it said that people would be ‘lovers of themselves, self-assuming, haughty, rm-thankful, having no natural affection, without self-control, without love of goodness, and headstrong.’ (2 Tim. 3:1-4) All such traits make for bad manners. As godly people, Christians must be on guard so as not to adopt this world’s lack of respect for others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> What Are Manners? </span><span class="font11">Good manners can be described as the acute awareness of the feelings of others, the ability to live with others in peace. Aspects of good manners are considerateness, courteousness, kindness, politeness, tactfulness, and thoughtfulness. These traits find their roots in one’s love for God and neighbor. (Luke 10:27) They cost nothing, but they are worth everything in enhancing our contacts with others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Jesus Christ set the perfect example. He always practiced the Golden Rule: “Just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them.” (Luke 6:31) Do we not marvel at Jesus’ thoughtfulness and loving manner in dealing with his disciples? (Matt. 11:28-30) His good manners did not come from rules laid down in etiquette books. They sprang from a sincere and generous heart. We must try to imitate his fine example.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When do Christians need good manners? Only on special occasions, when concerned about making a good impression? Are they needed only when trying to influence others? No! We ought to manifest good manners at all times. In what ways in particular should we be concerned about this in our association with one another in the congregation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> At the Kingdom Hall: </span><span class="font11">The Kingdom Hall is our place of worship. We are there at the invitation of Jehovah God. In that sense, we are guests. (Ps. 15:1) Are we exemplary guests when we come to the Kingdom Hall? Do we give appropriate attention to our dress and grooming? Surely we should want to avoid adornment that is casual or extreme. Whether attending conventions or our weekly congregation meetings, Jehovah’s people are noted for their mannerly appearance befitting those professing to reverence God. (1 Tim. 2:9, 10) Thus we show due consideration and respect for both our heavenly Host and the other guests that have been invited.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Another way in which we show good manners in connection with meetings is by being on time. Admittedly, this is not always easy. Some may live quite a distance away or may have large families to get ready. It has been noted in some congregations, however, that as many as 25 percent of the publishers habitually arrive after the opening song and prayer. This is a serious matter. It is good to remember that manners have to do with our awareness of the feelings of others. Jehovah, our gracious Host, has arranged these spiritual feasts for our benefit. We show our appreciation and concern for his feelings by being punctual. Additionally, arriving late at meetings is distracting and shows disrespect for those who are already in attendance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> When we assemble, do we take note of new ones in attendance? Welcoming them is part of being mannerly. (Matt. 5:47; Rom. 15:7) A gracious greeting, a warm handshake, a kind smile —all small things, but they add to what identifies us as true Christians. (John 13:35) After coming to a Kingdom Hall for the first time, a man said: “I met more genuinely loving people, total strangers, in one day than I had ever met in the church in which I was raised. It was apparent that I had found the truth.” As a result, he changed his life course, and seven months later he was baptized. Yes, good manners can have far-reaching effects!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> If we are mannerly toward strangers we meet, should we not be so “especially toward those related to us in the faith”? (Gal. 6:10) The principle applies: “You must show consideration for the person of an old man [or woman].” (Lev. 19:32) Never should such ones be overlooked at our gatherings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Paying Close Attention: </span><span class="font11">During congregation meetings, Christian ministers of God are speaking in order to impart some spiritual gift to upbuild us. (Rom. 1:11) It would certainly demonstrate very poor manners on our part if we were to doze off, noisily chew gum, repeatedly whisper to someone sitting nearby, make unnecessary trips to the rest room, read</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, AUGUST 2001</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">unrelated material, or attend to other things during the meeting. Elders should be exemplary in this regard. Good Christian manners will move us to show proper respect for the speaker and his Bible-based message by giving him our undivided attention.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> Additionally, out of consideration for both the speaker and the audience, we should keep electronic pagers and cellular telephones from disrupting our meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Manners and Children: </span><span class="font11">Parents should always be alert to the conduct of their children. If a young one begins crying or becomes restless during the meeting and this is disturbing others, it is good to take the child out of the auditorium as soon as possible in order to quiet him. This maybe difficult at times, but remember, this shows that you are alert to the feelings of others. Parents with small children who are likely to become restless often choose to sit toward the rear of the auditorium so as to disturb as few as possible should it become necessary for them to get up during the meeting. Of course, the rest in attendance can show due consideration for families by leaving the back rows open for them to use, if desired.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>12</sup> Parents must also be aware of their children’s conduct before and after meetings. Children should not be running inside the building, as this can cause accidents. Running around outside the Kingdom Hall can also be dangerous, particularly in the evenings when visibility is limited. Loud talking outdoors can disturb neighbors and reflect negatively on our worship. Parents who make a conscientious effort to supervise their children both inside and outside the Kingdom Hall are to be commended because this adds to the pleasantness of our dwelling together in unity.—Ps. 133:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> At the Book Study: </span><span class="font11">We appreciate the hospitality of our brothers who open their homes for congregation meetings. When attending, we need to show respect and consideration for their property. Before entering, we should carefully wipe our shoes in order to avoid soiling floors or carpets. Parents should supervise their children, making sure that they stay in the area of the home designated for the book study. While the group may be small and the atmosphere somewhat informal, we should not take liberties in the homes of others. A young child’s parent should accompany him or her when having to use the bathroom. Further, since the book study is a congregation meeting, we should dress as we do when going to the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> Good Manners Are Vital: </span><span class="font11">Practicing Christian manners not only reflects well on our ministry but also promotes good relations with others. (2 Cor. 6:3, 4, 6) As worshipers of the bappy God, we should find it easy to smile, to be agreeable, and even to do the small, kindly things that bring joy to others. These mannerly traits will beautify our lives as godly people.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">New Special Assembly Day Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">The theme of the special assembly day program for the new service year has a solid Scriptural thrust: “Subject Yourselves to God—Oppose the Devil.” (Jas. 4:7) This is sound guidance for these challenging times! Our obeying God’s commands puts us in direct confrontation with Satan. The program will teach us how to stand firm against the Devil’s faith-destroying, evil schemes. What are some of the spiritual gems we will receive at this assembly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The circuit overseer will show how “Manifesting Godly Subjection as Family Members” strengthens families to withstand the world’s pressures. The visiting speaker’s first talk of the day, “What It Means to Oppose the Devil,” will explain why and how we need to take assertive action to resist Satan’s aims to ruin our spirituality. Two parts are specially tailored to youths, who must also be alert to the Devil’s designs. Many Christians who are now adults refused to go along with the world’s desires when they were young. We will enjoy hearing some of their personal experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Subjection to authority is required of all who make up human society. Thus, the visiting speaker’s concluding talk will highlight four areas where our godly subjection must be manifest: (1) to governments, (2) in the congregation, (3) in secular occupations, and (4) in the family circle. What a practical program!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Those who wish to be baptized at this special assembly day need to notify the presiding overseer as soon as possible. All of us should mark the date on our calendar and plan to attend the entire assembly program. The blessings we receive will be everlasting as we subject ourselves to Jehovah eternally.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Keep Leisure in Its Proper Place</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In these difficult days, all of us need a change of pace from time to time. A certain amount of recreation is proper. However, too much time spent on leisure, entertainment, and socializing can lull a person into spending less and less time in spiritual pursuits. We must keep leisure in its proper place. (Matt. 5:3) How is this possible? By following the advice found at Ephesians 5:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Set Limits: </span><span class="font11">Paul wrote that Christians ought to “keep strict watch” as to how wisely they live their lives. Moderation and self-control are needed to limit leisure time to what is really necessary. It is good to give serious thought to the way in which we use our free time. Recreation should serve some beneficial purpose rather than make us feel that we have wasted our time or leave us exhausted. If we are left feeling empty, unrewarded, and somewhat guilty after engaging in an activity, this would indicate that adjustments need to be made in our use of time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Be Reasonable: </span><span class="font11">Paul gave counsel on “buying out the opportune time” for the more important things of life, not becoming “unreasonable.” Dedicated Christians cannot allow their lives to be centered on leisure. Although rest and diversion can renew us physically, the source of spiritual energy is God’s active force. (Isa. 40:29-31) We receive his spirit in connection with theocratic activities—studying the Bible, attending congregation meetings, engaging in field service —not through recreation.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Establish Priorities: </span><span class="font11">Paul instructed Christians to “go on perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.” Jesus taught that our activities should center on God’s Kingdom as our priority in life. (Matt. 6:33) It is imperative that we </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font11"> do the things that will allow us to live up to our dedication to Jehovah. Afterward, leisure time can be kept in its proper place. When that is done, it will have a wholesome effect, and we will enjoy it more.—Eccl. 5:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Wus to Eto More?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jesus likened the Kingdom to priceless treasures. (Matt. 13:44-46) The work of spreading the news of the Kingdom is also a valuable treasure. This ministry deserves top priority in our lives, even if having- a full share in it involves a measure of selfdenial. (Matt. 6:19-21) Do you want to do more in Kingdom service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Consider These Essentials: </span><span class="font11">Several things are necessary in order to expand our personal share in the ministry: (1) being determined to put Kingdom interests first in life (Matt. 6:33); (2) exercising faith and relying on Jehovah (2 Cor. 4:1, 7); (3) seeking God’s help through sincere and persistent prayer (Luke 11:8-10); (4) following through and acting in harmony with our prayers.—Jas. 2: 14, 17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Ways to Expand Our Ministry: </span><span class="font11">All of us can set the basic goal of regularly spending some time in the ministry each month. But have you also considered .seizing every opportunity to witness informally, striving to make your presentations more meaningful, increasing the effectiveness of your return visits, and endeavoring to conduct progressive home Bible studies? Might you be able to auxiliary or regular pioneer or to serve where the need is greater? If you are a baptized brother, could you reach out to qualify as a ministerial servant or an elder? (1 Tim. 3:1, 10) Could you expand your ministry by applying for Bethel service, Ministerial Training School, or missionary training at Gilead School? —Luke 10:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> A brother who had a full-time job and spent much time in sports activities was encouraged to become a regular pioneer. He began auxiliary pioneering and then adjusted his circumstances to enter the full-time ministry. He later attended the Ministerial Training School, which helped prepare him for his present assignment as a circuit overseer. He is very glad that he responded to the encouragement he received, and he is confident that he is much happier as a result of his decision to do more in Kingdom service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah blesses those who make themselves available. (Isa. 6:8) Let nothing hold you back from expanding your ministry and enjoying even greater satisfaction and refreshment as a result.</span></p></li></ul>

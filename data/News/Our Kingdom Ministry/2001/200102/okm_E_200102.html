<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Glorify Jehovah by Fine Works</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">‘When you are caught in a bad storm, how good it is to be able to And shelter! If it is warm and safe inside and if the residents are hospitable, you are glad to stay there. The Kingdom-preaching work directs people to such shelter from Satan’s system. Can our daily conduct help others see how inviting this safe haven is? Yes, for Jesus said that people would ‘see our fine works and give glory to our Father who is in the heavens.’—Matt. 5:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> How can we conduct ourselves so that our works will attract others to Jehovah and his organization? By letting Jesus’ words recorded at Luke 6:31 and 10:27 mold our lives each day. This will motivate us to show loving concern for fellow humans, differentiating us from this cold and uncaring world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> A sister on a seagoing ferry observed a young woman who was so seasick that she was unable to care, for her small child. The sister offered to look after the child. When the woman asked how she could show her gratitude, the sister said: ‘Please listen to Jehovah’s Witnesses the next time they call,’ The woman did so, and now she and her husband are Witnesses. Fine works made the difference in how they responded to the Kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Our Whole Life Is Involved: </span><span class="font9">Our conduct in the neighborhood, while at work or in school, and during periods of recreation causes others to form an opinion of us and of our religion. Hence, we do well to ask ourselves: ‘How do observers view me and my family? Do the neighbors consider our house and yard to be clean and well kept? Do our workmates and schoolmates view us as punctual and diligent? Will others find our appearance modest and respectful?’ Our fine works can make the worship of Jehovah more appealing to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Peter warned that Christians would be subject to derision. (1 Pet. 4:4) We must be sure that our conduct is not the cause of negative talk. (1 Pet. 2:12) If our daily works glorify the God whom we worship, then we will be like lamps held high, beckoning others to the safe shelter that Jehovah provides.—Matt. 5:14-16.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Persuade Others</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul earned the reputation of being a persuasive minister. (Acts 19:26) Even King Agrippa told him: “In a short time you would persuade me to become a Christian.” (Acts 26:28) What made Paul’s ministry so persuasive? He reasoned logically from the Scriptures, adapting his arguments to his listeners.—Acts 28:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In imitation of Paul, we too need to be persuasive in our ministry. How? By using insight when speaking with and listening to others. (Prov. 16:23) Three important steps will help us to accomplish this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Listen Carefully: </span><span class="font9">As the other person speaks, listen for a common ground on which to build. If he raises an objection, try to discern the reasoning behind it. It would help to know exactly what he believes, why he believes it, and what convinced him of it. (Prov. 18:13) Tactfully draw him out.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Ask Questions: </span><span class="font9">If a person expresses belief in the Trinity, you might ask: “Have you always believed the Trinity?” Follow up with: “Did you ever make a thorough study of what the Bible says on the subject?” You might also ask: “If God were part of a Trinity, could we not expect that the Bible would clearly say so?” The responses that you receive will help you reason with the individual on what the Scriptures say.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Use Sound Reasoning: </span><span class="font9">A Witness asked a woman who believed that Jesus was God: ‘If you were trying to illustrate that two persons are equal, what family relationship might you use?’ She replied: “I might use two brothers.” He added: “Perhaps even identical twins. But in teaching us to view God as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the Father</span><span class="font9"> and himself as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the Son,</span><span class="font9"> what message was Jesus conveying?” The woman got the point that one is older and has more authority. (Matt. 20:23; John 14:28; 20:17) Her mind and heart had been reached with the art of persuasion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Of course, not all are receptive to the truth, no matter how logical and accurate our presentation may b^. But like Paul, let us be diligent in searching out honesthearted ones in our territory, persuading them to accept the Kingdom message.—Acts 19:8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Attention: City Overseers</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The June 1996 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font8"> published a Question Box that answered the question: “How should the listing for Jehovah’s Witnesses appear in a local telephone directory?” The following direction was given: “In cities having more than one congregation, we recommend the following. Jehovah’s Witnesses, (City), (State), followed by an alphabetic listing giving the name, Kingdom Hall address, and phone number of the congregations.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Reports show that a number of congregations have not listed their Kingdom Hall or they have done so incorrectly. This has caused some problems, especially in larger cities where there are several congregations. We are requesting that city overseers take the initiative to review all listings published locally. If listings are incorrect or missing entirely, the city overseer should contact the publishers of the telephone directory to make any additions or corrections needed, carefully following the guidelines provided in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Successful Telephone Witnessing</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Our objective as Jehovah’s Witnesses is not merely to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">engage</span><span class="font10"> in preaching the good news but also to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">reach everyone possible </span><span class="font10">with the Kingdom message. (Acts 10:42; 20: 24) While the house-to-house work continues to be the principal way to reach people, we realize that not even by this systematic method do we contact everyone. So to ‘fully accomplish our ministry,’ we are using other methods—including telephone witnessing—to find sheeplike individuals.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In many places, people live in high-security apartments, multi-family complexes, or gated communities, where it is difficult to engage in our traditional door-to-door method of reaching people. Even in territories where we can work from house to house, a substantial number of people are not at home. However, many publishers are having excellent success in reaching these residents by telephone. In a morning of house-to-house work, one married couple had nine not-at-homes. After returning to the Kingdom Hall, they looked these up in a reverse directory that lists telephone numbers by addresses. They called the numbers and found eight of the householders at home!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’Are you reluctant to include telephone witnessing in your ministry? One brother admits: “I don’t like anyone cabling me at home to sell me anything, so I have a mental block about this type of witnessing.” However, after making just two phone calls, he said: “I love it! I nevei' thought that could happen, but I love it! People are relaxed on the phone, and you have everything you need within reach. This is great!” A sister had a similar reaction: “I was really not excited about telephone witnessing. To tell you the truth, I did not want to do it. But I tried it and found it to be very fruitful. I have 37 return visits from phone witnessing and more studies than I can care for!” If you are willing to try telephone witnessing, you too can be successful.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Organizing for Telephone Witnessing: </span><span class="font10">The witnessing activity of the congregation comes under the supervision of the service overseer. Depending on the need, the body of elders may choose to appoint another elder or a qualified ministerial servant to work closely with him in organizing telephone witnessing. The brother caring for territories should also be involved, since he will assign the territories and keep an up-to-date record. Likewise, the circuit overseer will be interested in the progress of the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> If there are areas in your territory not accessible by door-to-door witnessing, telephone territories should be prepared. The brother assigned will carefully make a list of the addresses that are to be converted into such territories, which should be kept relatively small so that they can be worked regularly. All territory maps with those areas on them should be marked with a notation that the specified section is designated for telephone witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> From where can you obtain the telephone numbers? A reverse directory that lists phone numbers by addresses may be available at the public library. If a high-security complex has its own telephone list, perhaps you can get the numbers from there. Otherwise, it may be possible to copy the names of the residents from the directory in the lobby and to look them up in a standard telephone book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> The elders can take an active interest in this work by arranging for those with experience in telephone witnessing to train others, perhaps through the Pioneers Assist Others program. Periodically, a local needs part on the Service Meeting may be devoted to enhancing the success of this feature of witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> When elders make shepherding calls on shut-ins or the infirm, they can be alert to encourage these ones to participate in telephone witnessing. Perhaps an elder can make a few calls while the publisher observes. Then the publisher may enjoy an opportunity to make a call. Many who have started in this way spend a few minutes each day in this work, and they really love it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Suggestions for Success: </span><span class="font10">When Jesus sent out his disciples to preach, he “sent them forth by twos.” (Luke 10:1) Why? He knew that by working together they would learn from and encourage each other. The same is true in telephone witnessing. By working as partners, you can learn from each other, discuss your results, and offer suggestions for the next conversation. Even during a phone call, you can help each other locate appropriate information.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> To promote clear thinking and concentration, sit where you can lay your witnessing materials—Bible, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font10"> brochure, magazines, and so forth—in front of you. Write out some presentations, and have them where you can see them. Be prepared to keep accurate and complete records, including the date and time of day so that you will know when to follow up the interest found.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> People are often cautious when hearing an unfamiliar voice on the phone. So be warm, friendly, and tactful. The householder has only the sound of your voice to determine your character and sincerity. Relax and speak from your heart. Speak slowly and clearly and with sufficient volume to be heard. Allow the householder opportunity to speak. Use your full name, and mention that you live in the community. We do not want people to think that we are telemarketers. Rather than saying that you are calling all the residents in a particular building or complex, personalize your call.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Telephone Presentations: </span><span class="font10">Many of the introductions on pages 9-15 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font10">book can be adapted to telephone witnessing. You might say: “I’m calling you on the phone because I’m unable to come and see you personally. The purpose of my call is to ask your opinion on a very interesting question.” Then state the question.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>13</sup> The first presentation under the heading “Crime/Safety” could be used this way: “Hello. My name is__I live in the commu</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">nity. I want to assure you that I am not selling anything or taking a survey. I am calling because of my concern about the matter of personal safety. There is a lot of crime around us, and it affects our lives. Do you think the time will come when all people will be able to walk on the street at night and feel safe? [Allow for response.] Let me read what God has promised to do.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>14</sup> Using the direct approach to offer Bible studies over the phone has had good results. The study may be demonstrated in a few minutes. Offer to visit the individual at his home to continue the study, or if the person is reluctant, offer to continue the study by phone on another day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>16</sup> When you close a conversation, have in mind something that will lead to your visiting the person at his home or to mailing a piece of literature. If the person hesitates to give you his address, offer to phone again. It may take several calls before he feels comfortable enough to invite you to his home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> Taking the Initiative: </span><span class="font10">A 15-year-old sister started her morning service with a phone call. She talked to a woman who agreed to accept a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book. When the sister delivered the book to the home, the woman wanted to know how the youth knew her phone number, since it was unlisted. The sister had dialed it by mistake! The woman welcomed a study and is now an unbaptized publisher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>17</sup> A sister signed out a telephone territory but held off working it for three weeks because of fear. What gave her the courage to start? She remembered the January 22,1997, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> article entitled “When I Am Weak, Then I Am Powerful.” It was about a Witness who preaches by telephone in spite of physical limitations. The sister said: “I prayed to Jehovah and asked for strength. I asked him to give me the proper words to give my presentation.” What was the result of her first day of telephone witnessing? She reports: “Jehovah answered my prayer. The people gave me their attention, and I arranged for a return visit.” Later her telephone witnessing resulted in a Bible study. She concludes: “Jehovah has taught me once more to trust in him and not in myself.”—Prov. 3:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>18</sup> Presenting the truth by telephone has become a successful method of preaching the good news. Prepare well, and participate wholeheartedly. Do not become discouraged if a favorable response is not forthcoming on the first few tries. Pray for Jehovah’s direction, and compare notes with others who are preaching in this exciting way. With a desire to miss no one in our territory, may we thoroughly carry out our ministry with urgency. —Rom. 10:13, 14.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What is your impression of the apostle Paul? As we read the book of Acts, we appreciate how industrious he was in Jehovah’s service. How did Paul accomplish all that he did? He said: “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.” (Phil. 4:13) We too can benefit from the power Jehovah imparts. How? By taking advantage of six provisions that he makes for us to be revitalized and strengthened spiritually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> God’s Word: </span><span class="font10">Just as we must eat food to maintain our physical strength, we must nourish ourselves with God’s Word in order to stay alive spiritually. (Matt. 4:4) The Bible provides the power to sustain us. To maintain our zeal and enthusiasm for the truth, we need to engage in meaningful personal study and meditation, daily if possible. —Ps. 1:2, 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Prayer: </span><span class="font10">It is important to draw close to Jehovah, particularly during times of special need. By means of his spirit, he gives energizing power to those asking him for it in prayer. (Luke 11:13; Eph. 3: 16) The Scriptures encourage us to “persevere in prayer.” (Rom. 12:12) Do you do that?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■<sup>4</sup>The Congregation: </span><span class="font10">We also draw strength and encouragement from congregation meetings and from the warm association that we enjoy there with our brothers and sisters. (Heb. 10:24, 25) When we are troubled, they help to raise us up and lovingly assist us.—Prov. 17:17; Eccl. 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> The Field Ministry: </span><span class="font10">Regular participation in the ministry helps us keep focused on the Kingdom and its blessings. Our spirits are lifted when we help others learn about Jehovah. (Acts 20:35) Not all of us can move to serve where the need is greater or share in the full-time service, but we can in other ways have a meaningful share in the ministry.—Heb. 6:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Christian Overseers: </span><span class="font10">We benefit from the encouragement and the assistance that the elders provide. Jehovah has assigned them to shepherd the flock of God in their care. (1 Pet. 5:2) Traveling overseers build up the congregations they serve, even as Paul did in his day.—Rom. 1: 11,12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Examples of Faithful Ones: </span><span class="font10">It is invigorating to consider the positive examples of faithful fellow workers, both ancient and modern. (Heb. 12:1) When you need to be revitalized, why not read one of the encouraging life stories in our magazines, an upbuilding report in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font10"> or some of the exciting accounts of the modern-day history of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers</span><span class="font10"> book?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> One brother, now in his mid-90’s, accepted the truth as a young lad. While he was still a youngster, his faith was put to the test. First of all, some who had been actively associated with the congregation abandoned Jehovah’s organization. Then there was the house-to-house work, which he found difficult. Nevertheless, he always relied on Jehovah. Soon he was enjoying the ministry. And today? In spite of failing health, he is still a member of the Brooklyn Bethel family, serving on the Governing Body. He has no regrets about sticking to Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> A sister who is a member of the Bethel family in Britain was baptized when she was 13. She began pioneering with her brother the next year, and the year after that, her father was imprisoned because of his neutrality during World War H. She kept looking to Jehovah for power, and she continued serving the true God. In time, she married a faithful brother, and together they kept doing Jehovah’s will. After 35 years of marriage, her husband died suddenly. Again she drew strength from Jehovah, and she has kept going to this day, looking forward to serving forever as a member of Jehovah’s earthly family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah assists and invigorates his faithful servants. “He is giving to the tired one power; and to the one without dynamic energy he makes full might abound.” We can tap into this limitless source of power by taking advantage of all six provisions mentioned above. Remember: “Those who are hoping in Jehovah will regain power. . . . They will run and not grow weary; they will walk and not tire out.” (Isa. 40:29-31) Paul leaned heavily upon Jehovah for strength, and so must we.</span></p></li></ul>

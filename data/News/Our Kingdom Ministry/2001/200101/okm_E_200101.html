<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Lot Your Light Shine”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The world around us is in darkness morally and spiritually. The light of truth exposes “the unfruitful works” of darkness so that these deadly stumbling blocks can be avoided. Consequently, the apostle Paul urged Christians: “Go on walking as children of light.”—Eph. 5:8, 11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> “The fruitage of the light” is in sharp contrast with the world’s gloom. (Eph. 5:9) To produce this fruitage requires that we be shining examples in Christian living, the sort of people that Jesus approves. We must also show such qualities as wholeheartedness, sincerity, and enthusiasm for the truth. This fruitage needs to be manifested in our everyday life and in our ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Shine at Every Opportunity: </span><span class="font12">Jesus told his disciples: “Let your light shine before men.” (Matt. 5:16) In imitation of Jesus, we reflect Jehovah’s light by preaching about God’s Kingdom and his purposes. We shine as illuminators when we visit the homes of people and when we spread the truth at work, at school, among our neighbors, or wherever else we have the opportunity.—Phil. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Jesus said that some would hate the light. (John 3:20) So we are not discouraged when the majority refuse to let “the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ” shine through to them. (2 Cor. 4:4) Jehovah reads the hearts of mankind and does not want practic-ers of unrighteousness among his people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’When we follow Jehovah’s ways and enjoy spiritual light, we can reflect it to others. If they recognize through our conduct that we “possess the light of life,” then they too may be motivated to make needed changes so as to become light bearers.—John 8:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> By letting our light shine, we bring praise to our Creator and help sincere ones get to know him and gain the hope of everlasting life. (1 Pet. 2:12) Since we have the light, let us use it to help others see the way out of spiritual darkness and produce the works that belong to the light.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Be a Good Listener</span></h4>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> It takes discipline to listen the material to be discussed, attentively. It also requires a and be sure to bring along your desire on the part of the lis- Bible and personal copy of the tener to learn and benefit from publication being studied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">what is heard. Hence, Jesus stressed the need to “pay attention to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font12"> you listen.”—Luke</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">8:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> This especially applies when we attend congregation meetings, assemblies, and conventions. These are occasions when we must listen carefully. (Heb. 2:1) Here are some points that will help you to be a good listener at these Christian gatherings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Appreciate the value of the meetings. They are a major way by which we are “taught by Jehovah” through “the faithful steward.”—Isa. 54:13; Luke 12:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Prepare in advance. Review</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ During the meetings, make a special effort to concentrate. Talking to those who are sitting with you as well as watching what others in the audience do should be avoided. Try not to be distracted by thinking about what you are going to do after the meeting or about other personal matters.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Analyze what is presented. Ask yourself: 'How does this apply to me? When am I going to apply it?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Make brief notes of main points and scripture texts. This helps you to focus your thoughts on what is being discussed and contributes to your remembering key points for later use.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Teach Your Children to Liston: </span><span class="font12">Children need spiritual instruction. (Deut. 31:12) In ancient times “all intelligent enough to listen” among God’s people had to be attentive as the Law was read to them. (Neh. 8:1-3) If parents are involved in the meetings and pay close attention, their children are likely to do the same. It is not wise to bring toys or coloring books to keep children amused. Unnecessary trips to the restroom also interfere with their listening. Since “foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy,” parents should put forth earnest effort to see that their children sit still and listen at meetings.—Prov. 22:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> By being good listeners, we prove that we are truly wise and want to “take in more instruction.”—Prov. 1:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">13 min: &quot;Let Your Light Shine.”* Include comments on June 1, 1997, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> page 15, paragraphs 1213. Encourage all to take advantage of every opportunity to witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">25 min: Loving Provisions for Our Health Care. Talk by a qualified elder, based on the December 1, 2000, letter and outline from the Society. Emphasize that the best possible legal protection against unwanted transfusions is achieved by filling out </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">both</span><span class="font11"> the Advance Medical Directive/Release card and the Society’s health-care durable power of attorney (DPA) form. These documents will be made available to baptized publishers after tonight’s meeting, but they should NOT be filled out tonight. The congregation should have a sufficient quantity of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">all three—the</span><span class="font11"> card, the revised DPA, and the Advance Directive Guide—on hand for distribution. Signing, witnessing, and dating of all cards will be done after the next Congregation Book Study, with assistance where necessary from the book study conductor. Those signing as witnesses should actually see the individual sign the document. The Society’s Advance Directive Guide should be carefully considered before completing the DPA. If a publisher has moved to another state, he should execute a new DPA form for that state. Book study conductors should ensure that all assigned to their group have the assistance they need to fill out the Advance Medical Directive/Release card and the DPA form. Identity Cards for children are available to parents after this meeting. Unbaptized publishers may write out their own directive for themselves and their children by adapting language from these documents to their own circumstances and convictions.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Announcements</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">■ Literature offer for January: Any 192-page book published in or prior to 1986 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that have on hand </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God</span><span class="font11"> may also offer it. February: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?, Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!,</span><span class="font11"> or any older 192-page book that the congregation has in stock. March: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font11"> A special effort will be made to start home Bible studies. April: The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines. Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. Offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> book or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require </span><span class="font11">brochure, with a view to starting home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Please note that the Memorial for the year 2002 will be on Thursday, March 28, after sundown and not on Friday, March 22, as indicated at the end of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">2001 Calendar. </span><span class="font11">This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. The elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances from other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner. Because of the importance of the occasion, in assigning a Memorial speaker, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother every year. An exception will be made if there is a capable elder of the anointed who can give the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ All baptized publishers present at the Service Meeting the week of January 8 may obtain the Advance Medical Directive/Release card and the Identity Card for their children. ■ Starting in February, and no later than March 4, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Judgment Day—A Time of Fear or Hope?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Sunday, April 8, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown.</span><span class="font11"> Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Since no meetings other than those for field service are to be held on that day, appropriate adjustments should be made for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> Study to be conducted at another time. Circuit overseers will need to adjust their meeting schedule for the week according to local circumstances. Although it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial observance, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from the occasion, allowing time to meet visitors and encourage newly interested ones. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ The special public talk for the 2001 Memorial season will be given on Sunday, April 1. The subject of the talk will be “Who Can Be Saved?” An outline will be provided. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer, a circuit assembly, or a special assembly day that weekend will have the special talk the week of April 9. No congregation should have the special talk before April 1, 2001.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Beginning with the January 1, 2001, issue, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> will be available in Kaonde and Seychelles Creole as monthly editions and in Silozi as a semimonthly edition.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Parents—Instill Useful Habits in Your Children</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">‘Useful habits are not acquired naturally, nor are they acquired by accident. Instilling good habits in children, moreover, takes time. “Instill” means “to impart gradually” or “to cause to enter drop by drop.” Consistency is required from parents in order for them to “go on bringing [their children] up in the discipline and mentalregulating of Jehovah.”—Eph. 6:4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Start From Infancy: </span><span class="font12">The ability of very young children to learn and to do new things is remarkable. Although adults often And it difficult to learn a new language, preschool children can learn two or three languages simultaneously. Never feel that your child is too young to develop good habits. If instruction in Bible truth begins early and is continued, by the time a child is a few years old, his mind will be filled with the knowledge that will make him “wise for salvation.”—2 Tim. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Make Field Service a Habit: </span><span class="font12">A useful habit to be instilled during a child’s formative years is that of regularly preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom. Many parents start this by taking their children in the house-to-house ministry while the children are infants. The parents’ regular involvement in the witness work helps their children develop appreciation and zeal for the ministry. Parents can show children how to share in giving a witness in each feature of field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Being enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School also helps children. It teaches them good study habits and how to read with understanding. They learn to converse about the Bible, make return visits, and conduct Bible studies. Such training may inspire them to pioneer and reach out for special privileges of service. Many Bethelites and missionaries fondly recall their early days in the school and look on it as a provision that helped them develop useful habits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> We are all like clay in the hands of the Great Potter, Jehovah. (Isa. 64:8) The fresher the clay, the easier it is to mold. The longer it dries, the harder it becomes. So it is with people. When they are young, they are more pliable—and the younger, the better. Their tender years are formative years, when shaping will take place for good or for bad. As a caring parent, begin early to instill in your children useful habits in the Christian ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Be a Happy Doer</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">‘Jesus said that during his presence, the vast majority would ‘take no note,’ just as in Noah’s day. (Matt. 24:37-39) It is expected, then, that many individuals will not listen to the Kingdom good news. What can help us maintain a joyful spirit as we perform our ministry? —Ps. 100:2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> First, we need to keep in mind that both our message and our commission to preach are from God. Any lack of response in the ministry, despite our best efforts, is really a rejection of Jehovah. Recalling that our faithfulness in preaching has his smile of approval will help us to maintain our joy and inner happiness as doers of God’s word.—Jas. 1:25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’Second, there are still individuals who will accept Jehovah’s means of salvation. Although the majority may be apathetic, there are sheeplike ones yet to be gathered, even now, deep in the time of the end. We need to keep preaching, going “into whatever city or village” to “search out who in it is deserving.”—Matt. 10:11-13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Maintain a Positive Attitude: </span><span class="font12">The deplorable record of false religion has disillusioned some. Others have been “skinned and thrown about&quot; by this system of things. (Matt. 9: 36) Many may be overwhelmed by their lack of employment, health care, and security. Understanding this will help us to persevere in our work. Endeavor to initiate conversations that address the issues of greatest concern to the people in our territory. Help them see that God’s Kingdom is the only solution. Use the Scriptures and specific points in the publications to reach their hearts with the good news.—Heb. 4:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Happy doers of God’s word always remember: “The joy of Jehovah is [our] stronghold.” (Neh. 8:10) There is no need to lose our joy. “If the house is deserving, let the peace you wish it come upon it; but if it is not deserving, let the peace from you return upon you.” (Matt. 10: 13) Jehovah renews our joy and strength as we patiently endure in his sacred service, and he blesses our faithfulness.</span></p></li></ul>

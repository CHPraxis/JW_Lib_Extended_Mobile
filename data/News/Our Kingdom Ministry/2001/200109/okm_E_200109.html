<p><span class="font10">“There are lovers of truth in nearly all religions. Yet, religions in general tend to divide humans. What would it take to unite honest-hearted people? [After a response, read Zephaniah 3:9.] This magazine shows how knowledge of the true God is uniting people everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Sept. 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Most of us take it for granted that there will always be plenty to eat. But now there are worries that science may be putting our food supply at risk. This magazine explains some of those concerns as well as the Bible’s hope for a real solution to the problem.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark8"></a>™W&amp;CHTOWER </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Oct. 1</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Announcing Jehovah'S Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“You might agree that faith in God has become an unpopular subject with many people. But why is this the case? [After a response, read Hebrews 11:1.] This magazine discusses what true faith is and what difference it makes whether we have faith or not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Awake! <sub>Oct</sub>. <sub>8</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“As you know, Halloween is a very popular celebration, and many children enjoy it. Have you ever had the opportunity to learn about its origin? [Allow for response.] You will find this subject to be fascinating reading, especially if you are a concerned parent.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> In the book of Acts, we are told that Jesus’ disciples accomplished their ministry by bearing/‘thorough witness'” to the people.’ (Acts 2:40; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">23) That was certainly the apostle Paul’s objective. (Acts 20:24) Is that not your goal as a minister of the good news? How can you accomplish this?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Prepare Your Presentation: </span><span class="font10">To ensure that you give a good witness in the ministry, prepa<sup>1 </sup>Cration is important. This is especially true when offering the magazines, since the subject matter changes constantly. To help equip us better, this issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> is introducing a new feature—the column at the left, which lists sample presentations for the current </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">magazines. A timely subject that will appeal to many people will be highlighted for each issue. How might you develop these brief presentations?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">^Choose) a suggestion that you feel will be most effective in your territory. Carefully read/the featured article, and take note of specific points that are likely to stir interest. Find a cited scripture in the magazine that ties in with the discussion and that you may be able to read to the householder. Add a brief conclusion; to encourage your listener to read the magazine and a brief statement, if appropriate, that. the.householder may make a donation to the worldwide work of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Now, rehearse your presentation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Plan to Ose the BSbBe: </span><span class="font10">With good planning, a scripture can often be worked into your presentation. For example, experienced publishers in many places are having success by going to the door with Bible in hand, greeting the householder, and saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">□ “We are asking people if they believe this . . .” Read Genesis 1:1, and then ask: “Do you agree with that statement?” If the person agrees, then say: “I do too. However, do you think that if God created all things, he is also responsible for wickedness?” After acknowledging the person’s response, read Ecclesiastes 7:29. Open the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book to page 71, and read paragraph 2. Encourage the person to read the book. If the householder does not agree with the statement at Genesis 1:1, urge him to examine the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font10"> book.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Follow (Up All Interest: </span><span class="font10">You cannot fully accomplish your ministry if you do not follow up the interest that is found. When you have a good discussion, regardless of whether you place magazines or other literature, make note of the person’s name and address. Diligently, tjy. to cultivate the p</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">erson’s interest </span><span class="font10">by returning promptly. By all means, offer a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> The first-century disciples knew that Jesus had ordered them “to give a thorough witness.” (Acts 10:42) That same command applies to us, for it is the only way that we will be able to make disciples. (Matt. 28: 19, 20) Let us do our utmost to accomplish our ministry thoroughly.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p>

Invite publishers to comment on key points learned and how they were able to apply them personally or as family groups. (Portions can be assigned in advance.) Feature these program parts: (1) “Love for God Motivates Us in Our Ministry.” Such love helps us cope with negative feelings that might inhibit our preaching—timidity, feelings of inadequacy, fear of men. (2) “Lovers of Jehovah Hate What Is Bad.” (w99 10/1 28-31) Having a relationship with God depends on our hating what he hates—not only what is obviously wicked but also subtle wrongs. (3) “Pursue the Surpassing Way of Love.” (w92 7/15 27-30) First Corinthians 13:4-8 shows why we patiently put up with the imperfections of others, avoid self-centeredness and competition, do not spread harmful gossip, and remain loyal to God’s organization. (4) “Things in the World —How Do We View Them?” We should </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font9"> love the things in the world, succumb to desires of the flesh, be misled by desires of the eyes, or make a showy display of our means of life. (5) “Being No Part of the World Safeguards Us.” Second Corinthians 6:14-17 shows how certain beliefs, customs, and practices can make us unacceptable to God. We must discern and avoid pitfalls devised by the Devil. (6) “Divine Promises to Those Loving God.” (zc86 6/15 5-6) Jehovah’s blessing adds delight to our lives and enriches us spiritually. —1 Tim. 6:17-19.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Most people lead busy lives. Jehovah’s Witnesses are among the busiest—studying God’s Word, attending congregation meetings, and sharing in the field service. In addition, we are busy caring for secular work, housework or schoolwork, and many other responsibilities, which all take time. This is especially challenging for family heads.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Because of unfavorable economic conditions in various places, heads of households may have to work long and hard to make a living. When demanding secular jobs take most of their time and strength, they have little left for the preaching work. Since they have an obligation to provide materially for their families, some may feel that they can have only a limited share in the ministry. (1 Tim. 5:8) Granted, today there are many pressures connected with obtaining the necessities of life. But one’s secular work need not become an obstacle to preaching the good news. (Mark 13:10) Hence, we do well to examine our actual situation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Because the world scene is always changing, a family head may be inclined to spend an excessive amount of time on the job, with a view to building up his financial reserves for unforeseen crises. (1 Cor. 7:31) While increased secular work may seem to provide extra material things or additional opportunities for recreation and entertainment, will this make the family happier and more contented if it is done at the expense of time for spiritual pursuits and regular meeting attendance? We would certainly want to avoid anything that would endanger our spirituality. Heeding Jesus’ counsel to ‘store up treasures in heaven’ and be “rich toward God” is the wise course.—Matt. 6:19-21; Luke 12:15-21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Seek Kingdom Interests First: </span><span class="font10">Jesus taught his followers to put spiritual matters ahead of everything else. He urged them: “Never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to put on?”’ Why would he say that? He explained: “For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things.” If we are truly convinced of that, there will be no obstacle that will prevent us from doing what Jesus next said: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these [necessary material] things will be added to you.” God will see to that! (Matt. 6:31-33) This certainly is no time to be distracted by undue anxiety over making a living or by a desire to get comfortably situated in a system of things that will soon pass away.—1 Pet. 5:7; 1 John 2: 15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> The primary purpose of secular work is to provide for one’s material needs. But how much do we need? The apostle Paul wrote: “Having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.” Are we trying to acquire more than that? If so, we may be reaping the consequences that Paul warned about: “Those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires, which plunge men into destruction and ruin.” (1 Tim. 6:8, 9; Matt. 6:24; Luke 14:33) How can we tell if we are being hindered by excessive desires?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If because of our secular pursuits we have only a minimal share in field service or fail to see the need to make sacrifices for the sake of the good news, then there is a need to adjust our priorities. (Heb. 13:15, 16) A more modest lifestyle will go a long way toward eliminating this obstacle to our preaching. Kingdom interests should always be the first priority when it comes to the use of our time and energy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> The Labor That Os Mot On Vain: </span><span class="font10">Paul’s words encourage us always to have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that [our] labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15:58) The foremost “work of the Lord” is the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) To have as full a share as possible, we should schedule time for the field service each week and endeavor not to use that time for any other pursuit. (Eph. 5:15-17) Then, neither secular work nor anything else will become an obstacle to our ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> When we give of ourselves in sharing Bible truths with others, we experience the superior happiness that comes from giving. (Acts 20:35) By pursuing the Kingdompreaching work, we can look to the future with confidence, “for God is not unrighteous so as to forget [our] work and the love [we] showed for his name.” —Heb. 6:10.</span></p></li></ul>

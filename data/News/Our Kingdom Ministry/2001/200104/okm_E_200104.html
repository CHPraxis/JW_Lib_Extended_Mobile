<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“With God All Things Are Possible”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">'‘The primary work of the Christian congregation is to preach the Kingdom message worldwide. (Matt. 24:14) That is a tremendous undertaking. To many observers, it seems to require resources far beyond what we possess. To others, fulfilling this assignment is almost inconceivable because we are subject to ridicule, opposition, and persecution. (Matt. 24:9; 2 Tim. 3: 12) Skeptics are convinced that this work is something impossible to accomplish. However, Jesus said: “With God all things are possible.”—Matt. 19:26.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Positive Examples to Imitate: </span><span class="font10">Jesus began his ministry as one man against a whole system of things. To try to prevent him from succeeding, opposers subjected him to every imaginable indignity, finally inflicting upon him an agonizing death. Yet, in the end, Jesus confidently declared: “I have conquered the world.” (John 16:33) Truly an incredible accomplishment!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Jesus’ disciples displayed the same courageous spirit and zeal in the Christian ministry. Many were flogged, beaten, thrown into jail, and even put to death. Yet, they were “rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.” (Acts 5:41) With the odds against them, they accomplished the seemingly impossible task of preaching the good news “to the most distant part of the earth.”—Acts 1:8; Col. 1:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> How to Succeed in Our Day: </span><span class="font10">We too have zealously taken up the Kingdom-preaching work in the face of seemingly impossible odds. In spite of bans, persecution, imprisonment, and other violent attempts to stop us, we are succeeding. How is this possible? ‘“Not by a military force, nor by power, but by my spirit,’ Jehovah of armies has said.” (Zech. 4:6) With Jehovah behind us, nothing can stop our work!—Rom. 8:31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> When we preach, we have no reason to be timid or fearful or to feel inadequate. (2 Cor. 2:16, 17) We have overpowering reasons to press forward in spreading the good news of the Kingdom. With Jehovah’s help, we will accomplish the “impossible”!—Luke 18:27.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Be “Intensely Occupied” With Your Ministry</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When we read that the apostle Paul worked at tentmaking while in Corinth, we might conclude that this limited his opportunity to preach. However, Acts 18:5 relates: “Paul began to be </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">intensely occupied</span><span class="font10"> with the word, witnessing to the Jews to prove that Jesus is the Christ.” Why was Paul so occupied with the preaching activity? Even though many in Corinth had already become believers, the Lord confirmed that there were yet many more disciples to be made in that city. (Acts 18:8-11) Do we have similar reason to be intensely occupied with our ministry? Yes. Many more people can be found and taught the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Spend More Time in Service During April: </span><span class="font10">Likely it is your goal to keep busy in preaching the good news every month. But certain months especially lend themselves to our being “intensely occupied” with this activity. These include the month of April, at the height of the Memorial season. Have your circumstances allowed you to auxiliary pioneer or to increase your effort in the ministry this spring? Many publishers who are doing so have been richly blessed. (2 Cor. 9:6) If you are doing all that you can, remember that Jehovah is pleased with your whole-souled service. (Luke 21:2-4) Whatever your circumstances, make it your goal to be “intensely occupied” with your ministry during April. And do not forget to turn in your field service report at the end of the month so that your effort will be counted with that of the rest of Jehovah’s people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Visit New Ones Who Attended the Memorial: </span><span class="font10">In the United States last year, the Memorial attendance was 2,153,268. The total attendance for this year remains to be seen. Yet, reports indicate that there exists a marvelous potential for a greater “harvest.” (Matt. 9:37, 38) Therefore, as soon as possible, arrange to visit the interested ones who attended the Memorial to assist them spiritually. Postponing such visits could allow ‘the wicked one to snatch away the word of the kingdom sown in their hearts.’ (Matt. 13:19) A prompt visit will show that you are indeed “intensely occupied” with your ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Continue to Assist the Inactive Ones: </span><span class="font10">In February a special effort began to help inactive ones. If there are some who have not yet received a shepherding call, the elders should arrange to visit them well before April ends. The elders will endeavor to determine the underlying cause of the individual’s problem and how best to assist him to serve Jehovah actively again. This loving help shows that the elders take seriously their responsibility as shepherds of “the flock of God.” (1 Pet. 5:2; Acts 20:28) The September 15, 1993, issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> pages 22-3, provides excellent suggestions that can be used by the elders when addressing any of five typical problems that may be affecting inactive ones. Ideally, some can still be reactivated in the field ministry during April.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Help More to Become Unbaptized Publishers: </span><span class="font10">Have your children qualified as new publishers of the good news? What about others with whom you are studying the Bible? If such ones are approved by the elders, would not April be a wonderful time for them to begin publishing? If a person is making progress and has studied the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font10"> brochure and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book, the Bible study may be continued in a second book—either the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Word</span><span class="font10"> book, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace</span><span class="font10"> book, or the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship</span><span class="font10"> book. Your goal is to help the student achieve greater insight into the truth, qualify as an unbaptized publisher, and become a dedicated and baptized Witness of Jehovah.—Eph. 3:17-19; 1 Tim. 1:12; 1 Pet. 3:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Your consistent and genuine interest in your Bible students may help them eventually to make the truth their own. One Witness met an elderly couple who heartily agreed to a Bible study. But the couple postponed the study three weeks in a row. Eventually the study was started. Then, the couple canceled the study almost every other week. Finally, though, the wife progressed to the point of baptism. “After she was baptized,” the brother recalls, “her eyes were filled with tears of happiness, which brought tears of happiness to both my wife and me.” Yes, being “intensely occupied” with the good news brings great joy!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> Bible prophecy and world events indicate that we are living deep in the time of the end. Now is when all of God’s people need to be “intensely occupied” with making the good news known to others. The apostle Paul gives assurance that such labor is definitely “not in vain in connection with the Lord.”—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Question Box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">■ When would it be appropriate to form an additional Congregation Book Study group?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Forming a new group should be considered when it is necessary in order to maintain an attendance of about 15 or fewer at each of the book study locations, including the Kingdom Hall. Why is this recommended?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When Congregation Book Study groups are kept small, the conductor is better able to give attention to each one who attends. Additionally, all have ample opportunity to comment in a setting that is conducive to making public declaration of their faith. (Heb. 10:23; 13:15) Having smaller groups in several locations throughout the congregation’s territory makes attending the Congregation Book Study and meetings for field service more convenient. Congregations that have increased the number of locations have found that the combined attendance at the book study has also increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There may be special circumstances that make it advisable to form another group, even if it will be rather small. This may be true in an isolated area or where present locations are crowded or lack adequate seating. When needed, a group can be formed that meets during the day for the benefit of older ones, night workers, or sisters with nonWitness husbands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Each book study group should have several spiritually strong and active publishers assigned as well as a qualified conductor and reader. Brothers should reach out to fill these needs in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Elders can promote the advancement of the congregation by ensuring that the congregation’s book study groups are reasonable in size and spiritually well cared for and that they meet at convenient locations. Whenever it is practical, new groups should be formed so that all can take full advantage of the benefits of this unique spiritual arrangement. Could you offer your home as a book study location? Many who have done so have experienced spiritual blessings.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Simplicity Is Best</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Why do young publishers often hold the attention of those with whom they share the Kingdom message? One reason is that their expressions are simple. Some publishers may feel that to witness effectively requires an eloquent presentation. However, experience shows that a simple and clear presentation is the best.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God in a simple, straightforward manner and trained his disciples to do the same. (Matt. 4:17; 10:5-7; Luke 10:1, 9) He used uncomplicated introductions, questions, and illustrations to capture the attention of his listeners and reach their hearts. (John 4:7-14) We do well to imitate his example and give presentations that are easily understood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The “good news of the kingdom” is the message we are to proclaim. (Matt. 24:14) Using the Kingdom as your basic theme will help keep your presentation simple. Speak of things that concern your listeners. Women are often more interested in their family than in political subjects. Of immediate concern to a father are his employment and his family’s safety. Young people are interested in their future; older people, in better health and their security. People are usually more concerned about local events than what happens in distant lands. After conversing about matters of common interest, direct attention to the blessings that obedient mankind will enjoy under God’s Kingdom rule. A few simple, well-chosen words combined with a scripture can be the best means to stir your listener’s interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> You might start a conversation by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “No doubt you agree that mankind is plagued with many incurable diseases. But did you know that God has promised he will soon eliminate all forms of sickness, as well as death?” Allow for a response, and then read Revelation 21:3, 4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> With clear and simple presentations, may you reach the minds and hearts of more people in your territory, aiding them to learn about Jehovah and the prospect of enjoying everlasting life.—John 17:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Witness as a Good Neighbor</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jesus said to “love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matt. 22:39) Undoubtedly, you “work what is good” toward fellow believers, but can you widen out in your love toward those people who live nearby? (Gal. 6:10) In what ways?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> By Identifying Yourself: </span><span class="font10">Do your neighbors know that you are a Witness? If not, why not call on them in field service? The results may surprise you! Or if you would feel more comfortable, try to witness to them informally. When outdoors, you might see them working in their yard or casually walking by on the street. Approach them with a warm smile. Endeavor to speak about your beliefs, the location of the Kingdom Hall, and what goes on there, and let them know whoever else from the neighborhood attends. Extend an invitation to the meetings. Be determined to bear thorough witness about the good news to everyone you know.—Acts 10: 42; 28:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> By Your Exemplary Conduct: </span><span class="font10">Your neighborly conduct speaks volumes about you and may open the way to give a witness. It also ‘adorns the teaching of God.’ (Titus 2:7,10) Show genuine interest in your neighbors. Be friendly and understanding. Respect their right to privacy and quiet surroundings. If one of them becomes ill, be considerate and offer to help. When a new family moves into the neighborhood, stop by to welcome them. Such kind acts leave a favorable impression and are pleasing to Jehovah.—Heb. 13:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> By the Appearance of Your Property: </span><span class="font10">Being a good neighbor includes caring for your home so that it is presentable. A home and yard that are clean and attractive are a witness in themselves. But a home that is dirty or that has discarded items lying around will likely detract from the Kingdom message. Thus, it is very important to keep your home, yard, and vehicles clean and in good repair.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Displaying concern for those outside the Christian congregation demonstrates love for your neighbors. What may be the outcome? It may well be that “as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses,” some of them will “glorify God.”—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> For many reasons, we need to rely on Jehovah. Preaching the good news “in all the inhabited earth” is a daunting assignment. (Matt. 24:14) Constantly, we battle with our imperfect flesh. (Rom. 7:21-23) Moreover, “we have a wrestling... against the [superhuman] world rulers of this darkness.” (Eph. 6:11,12) Clearly, </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">we ne</span><span class="font14">ed_help. How can we gain strength from Jehovah?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Bv Prayer: </span><span class="font14">Jehovah freely gives his powerful! h.Q</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">&amp; spiri</span><span class="font14">t, to his servants who^asKIor it^ (Luke 11:13) Do you lack confidence in your ability to witness from house to house, on the street, or over the telephone? Are you timid about witnessing informally? Has public apathy in the territory lessened your zeal? What if you are pressured to compromise your faith or integrity? Rely on Jehovah. Pray for strength</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">.—Phil. 4:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> By Personal Study: </span><span class="font14">Just as we gain strength by eating physical food, so we are fortified spiritually by feeding regularly on God’s Word and on the publications of “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Matt. 4:4; 24:45) When asked what gave him strength to endure years of solitary confinement in China without a Bible, Stanley Jones said: “We can stand firm in faith. Of course, we have to study first. </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">We have n</span><span class="font14">o </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">inner </span><span class="font14">strength if we don’t study.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Sy Meeting Attendance: </span><span class="font14">At a Christian meeting in the first century, Judas and Silas “encouraged the brothers with many a discourse and strengthened them.” (Acts 15:32) Likewise today, </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">what we hear at the </span><span class="font14">meeting^ deepens our apprecia-. tion forJehoyah, builds uo our fa</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ith</span><span class="font14">, and </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">stimulates us</span><span class="font14"> for the ministry. The meetings bring us into regular contact with “fellow workers for the kingdom of God,” who are our “strengthening aid.”—Col. 4:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> We need help in these “critical times hard to deal with.” (2 Tim. 3:1) Concerning those who draw strength from Jehovah, we are assured: “They will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary; they will walk and not tire out.”—Isa. 40:31.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Jesus compared our days with those of Noah. (Luke 17:26, 27) The people back then were busy with the everyday affairs of life. However, Noah made the time to build an immense ark: and to preach.

Most congregations have many youngsters who share in the preaching work. It is appropriate for them to do so, even if it means witnessing mostly to adults. (Ps. 148:12, 13; Matt. 21:15, 16) When parents and other publishers take an interest, providing training and encouragement, young ones experience much joy in the field service. Invite audience to suggest ways to include young ones in door-to-door and return visit work. Ask parents to relate what they have done to help their children learn how to offer magazines, to use the Bible in their presentations, and to speak with confidence at the doors. Stress the benefits of giving children commendation. Interview one or two young publishers, and let them tell what they are enjoying about the preaching work and why.</span></p>

Consider the following examples of how various features in the book are very useful in explaining Bible teachings: Definitions, such as for “Kingdom” (pages 225-6) or “spirit” (page 380); comparative renderings from a variety of translations, showing where and how God’s name is used in the Bible (pages 191-3) or the truth about hell (pages 169-70); lists, detailing beliefs that set us apart from other religions (pages 199-201) or showing how a person can know which religion is right (pages 328-30); historical background, revealing the origin of Christmas (pages 176-8) or the neutrality of early Christians (pages 273-5); scientific evidence, supporting creation (pages 85-6) or showing the harmfulness of marijuana and tobacco use (pages 108-11).

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The American woman was a devout Roman Catholic. She faithfully defended the church’s teachings. She even made a pilgrimage to the Vatican. And yet, when one of Jehovah’s Witnesses called at her door, she accepted the offer of a home Bible study. Why? Because she wanted to learn what the Bible says and her church did not offer a home Bible study. What does this experience teach us? That we never know who is likely to accept a free Bible study.—Eccl. 11:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Have you ever hesitated to tell people that we are willing to study the Bible with anyone who is interested? Does everyone in your community know that we offer this free service? How can we make sure that they do? By making use of a new tool! It is an attractive, six-page tract entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</span><span class="font4"> Let’s get acquainted with this tract, subheading by subheading.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> “Why Read the Bible?” </span><span class="font4">The reasons that the tract gives are very appealing. It explains that the Bible contains “loving instruction from God,” showing how to approach him in prayer for help and how to receive his gift of everlasting life. (1 Thess. 2:13) The tract refers to various Bible “truths that give enlightenment,” such as what happens after we die and. why there is so much trouble on earth. It describes “godly principles in the Bible” that when applied bring physical benefits and ^promote happiness, hope, and other desirable qualities. The tract refers to one more reason for reading the Bible—the prophecies about the future that show what is just ahead of us.—Rev. 21:3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> “Help m Understanding the Bible”: The tract states: “All of us need help in understanding God’s Word.” Then it describes our method of studying the Bible: “Usually it is best to study the Bible progressively, beginning with basic teachings.” While making it plain that “the Bible is the authority,” the tract specifically mentions the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font4"> brochure as something that will help the student “to understand Scriptural references on a variety of subjects.” The next subheading raises a compelling question.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> “Are You Willing to Spend Time Each Week to Understand the Bible?” </span><span class="font4">The tract explains that the Bible study can be arranged at a time and place convenient for the student, either in the privacy of his or her own home or even over the telephone. Who can share in the discussion? The tract answers: “Your entire family. Any friends that you choose to invite may also share. Or if you prefer, the discussion can be held with just you.” For how long must one study? It explains: “Many set aside an hour each week to study the Bible. If you are able to spend more time or are limited to less time each week, the Witnesses will make themselves available to help you.” There is the key! We are willing to adjust to the circumstances of each student.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> “Am Invitation to beam”: A coupon is provided on which the recipient of the tract can request the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font4"> brochure or a visit to explain our free home Bible study program. The cover of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font4"> brochure is shown in full color. Can you not see why this tract will encourage more honesthearted ones to accept our help? Now, how can we make the best use of this new tool?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> To Whom Can You Offer the Tract? </span><span class="font4">The tract can be handed to people in person or left at not-at-homes. It can be distributed from house to house, on the street, and in business territory. Offer it to people whether they accept our literature or refuse it. Insert it into the magazines or other publications that are placed. Enclose it when you are writing letters. Offer to mail it to those whom you contact by telephone. Always have copies with you to distribute when shopping, when using public transportation, and when witnessing informally. Give it to anyone who calls at your door. Offer it to your relatives, neighbors, workmates, schoolmates, and other acquaintances. Endeavor to get this tract into the hands of everyone you meet! Then what?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Off </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We Response Is Immediate: </span><span class="font4">Some individuals will respond immediately by saying that they would like to have a Bible study. Therefore, whenever engaged in field service activity, be sure you always have two copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Require </span><span class="font4">brochure—one for the student and one for yourself. If the person is willing, start the study right then and there. Open to the inside cover, and read “How to Use This Brochure.” Then go right to lesson 1, and demonstrate the study. What could be easier?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Di? Your Listener Creeds Tim® to Think About It: Before too much time elapses, endeavor to contact him again. When you do, be sure to have the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font4"> brochure with you. Show him the table of contents on the inside cover. Let him pick the subject that looks the most interesting to him. Turn to it, and begin discussing the lesson he chose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Following Up Magazine Placements: </span><span class="font4">If you left the tract along with a set of magazines, you might return with this approach: “The last time I called, I was pleased to leave with you a copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine. Perhaps you noticed that the full title of the journal is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom.</span><span class="font4"> Today I would like to explain what this Kingdom is and what it will mean for you and your family.” Then open the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font4"> brochure to lesson 6. Beginning with the first paragraph, read and discuss as much as the householder has time for. Then make arrangements to return another day and finish the lesson.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Do Not Run Out of Tracts: </span><span class="font4">The service overseer and the brothers who handle literature supplies will want to keep an ample supply of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Know the Bible </span><span class="font4">tract on hand at all times in the congregation. Keep some in your pocket or purse, in your car, at your workplace, at school, near the entrance to your home —wherever they will be handy. Of course, carry some in your witnessing case for those times when you meet someone with whom you can converse about the Bible.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">©ur Efforts: </span><span class="font4">A desirable goal for all Christians is to teach the truth to someone else. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Are you currently conducting a home Bible study? If you are, can you find time for another one in your weekly schedule? If you are not now conducting a study, surely you wish you were.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The distressing last days, where we now find ourselves, have brought increased pressures and serious tests of many kinds upon God’s people everywhere. (2 Tim. 3:1-5) All of us need encouragement to stand firm in the faith. (1 Cor. 16:13) We can do so with Jehovah’s help as we continue to feed regularly on his Word, rely on his spirit, and stick close to his organization.—Ps. 37:28; Rom. 8: 38, 39; Rev. 2:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> With good reason, the theme “Become Full-Grown in Powers of Understanding” was developed in last year’s special assembly day program. It was based on 1 Corinthians 14:20, where we read the apostle Paul’s words: “Brothers, do not become young children in powers of understanding, but be babes as to badness; yet become full-grown in powers of understanding.” What did you think of the program?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> “How encouraging!” “This was just what we needed!” Those were only a couple of the responses. Even a non-Witness who came to •.he special assembly day to see his 12-year-old daughter get baptized said that he was very impressed with the program and that he could see how it would be beneficial to his family. Is that the way you feel? Let us recall some of the highlights of the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Accurate Knowledge Os Necessary to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Develop Perceptive Powers: </span><span class="font4">In the opening talk, “Develop Your Powers of Understanding Now,” what did the speaker emphasize is needed to meet today’s challenges? More than mental ability. We must develop and deepen our powers of Bible understanding, lest we be conquered by all the badness to which we are exposed. This understanding calls for divine direction. Like the psalmist, we must prayerfully ask Jehovah to make us understand his laws and reminders so that we may serve him wholeheartedly.—Ps. 119: 1, 2, 34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> In the next part, the circuit overseer showed that Jehovah, through his Word and organization, provides us with “Aids to Becoming Full-Grown in Bible Understanding.” Understanding was defined as “the ability to see into a matter and discern its composition by grasping the connections between its parts and the whole, thus getting the sense of it.” Who can aid us in developing this ability? Jehovah has provided gifts in men to help us make spiritual progress. (Eph. 4:11, 12) His earthly organization urges us to read God’s Word every day and to attend all congregation meetings regularly. (Ps. 1:2) We are taught how to use the Bible and our Christian publications in personal and family study as well as in preparing for meetings and field service. Have you been taking advantage of all these provisions? Are you maintaining a regular, personal Bible-reading program? This is essential if we are to be protected from falling prey to worldly trends, fads, philosophies, and deceptive influences.—Col. 2:6-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Our PercepiDve Powers Rflusft Be Trained: In his first talk, entitled “Safeguard Spirituality by Training Your Perceptive Powers,” the visiting speaker explained that those in the world cannot distinguish right from wrong. (Isa. 5:20, 21) This is due to their refusal to acknowledge and observe God’s righteous standards. In contrast, we who have received spiritual training in Jehovah’s organization recognize God’s standards, which serve to guide our activities and conduct. Thus, we are in a position to prove to ourselves what is good and acceptable in Jehovah’s eyes and what is in accord with his perfect will.—Rom. 12:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> To avoid the world’s confused thinking and consequent bad fruitage, we must continually train our perceptive powers. How is this accomplished? As recorded at Hebrews 5:12-14, the apostle Paul emphasized the need to feed on more than just the “milk” of the word. We need solid spiritual food, such as we are receiving in the study of Isaiah’s prophecy at the Congregation Book Study. Then we must readily apply in our lives what we learn. When we do so, we are convinced of the rightness of Jehovah’s principles and standards. This trains our perceptive powers to distinguish clearly both right and wrong.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Sad to say, some have faltered spiritually. Why? They have not focused their attention on what is good and upright in Jehovah’s eyes. As a result, they have fallen victim to radio and television talk shows with Scripturally objectionable content, to debasing music, or to bad influences in computer chat rooms. By acting wisely, we will avoid being influenced by immoral, stupid, or wicked men.—Prov. 13:20; Gal. 5:7; 1 Tim. 6:20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Youths Must “Be Babes as to Badness”: The program had two parts that specifically encouraged young ones to develop their perceptive powers. The speakers showed that being “babes as to badness” means remaining inexperienced, that is, innocent as babes, with regard to things that are unclean in Jehovah’s sight. (1 Cor. 14:20) All of us were encouraged to keep strict watch on how we use our time so as to resist being exposed to all sorts of badness and avoid being infected by it. (Eph. 5:15-17) We were encouraged to calculate how much time we spend reading material that does not directly contribute to our growth in understanding spiritual things. Did you do that? What did the results reveal? In addition to reading the Bible daily, be determined to keep up with the reading material that the organization provides. Doing this will help all of us, including young ones, to “acquire understanding.”—Prov. 4:7-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> “Bemofit From Applying Bible Principles With Understanding”: That was the theme of the concluding talk of the special assembly day program. The guest speaker explained that Jehovah is the Source of lifegiving understanding, which is infinitely superior to that of all mankind. Just imagine having the opportunity to tap into Jehovah’s understanding! He generously grants it to those who sincerely seek it and ask for it in faith. (Prov. 2:3-5, 9; 28:5) Are you taking full advantage of his offer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> We were encouraged to learn to identify principles as we read the Bible. (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) Carefully study them to have an accurate understanding of what Jehovah is saying. Take time to meditate on these principles and fix them in your mind and heart. This will train your perceptive powers so that you can be successful when making life’s decisions. (Josh. 1:8) Let us take a few situations that many face and see how applying Bible principles can help us to succeed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>12</sup> ‘Should I adopt a certain style of dress and grooming?’</span><span class="font4"> The world’s faddish trends in clothing and grooming often reflect a spirit of rebellion. Such a spirit influences people to dress shoddily and unattractively or to flaunt sexuality. What relevant Bible principles will help us to counteract such tendencies? Having trained our perceptive powers, we will take into consideration the principle found at 1 Timothy 2:9, 10, to dress “with modesty and soundness of mind . . . , in the way that befits [people] professing to reverence God.” Other principles that apply include those mentioned at 2 Corinthians 6:3 and Colossians 3:18, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> ‘WTiat </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">can I do to keep my family bonds strong?’</span><span class="font4"> Good communication among family members is vital. James 1:19 tells us: “Every man must be swift about hearing, slow about speaking, slow about wrath.” Family members need to listen as well as to talk to one another because family communication is a two-way street. Even when what' we say is true, if it is said in a cruel, proud, or insensitive manner, it is likely to do more harm than good. So whether we are a husband or a wife, a parent or a child, we should let our speech “be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt.”—Col. 4:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>14</sup> ‘Am I being affected by materialism?’</span><span class="font4"> Materialism is a worldly pressure that complicates one’s life. It does not unlock the door to happiness. (Eccl. 5:10; Luke 12:15; 1 Tim. 6:9, 10) To help us avoid the snare of materialism, Jesus taught us this important principle: Keep a simple eye. Living a balanced, less complicated life involves focusing our eyes on Kingdom interests, making everything else secondary.—Matt. 6:22, 23, 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> What Our Objective Should Be: We have in God’s Word a reliable source of righteous principles to guide us in making decisions. We need to learn these principles, to meditate on them, and to understand how to apply them in our lives. By thus ‘training our perceptive powers to distinguish right and wrong,’ we will benefit ourselves and honor Jehovah.—Heb. 5:14.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The apostle John wrote: “As for us, we love, because [Jehovah] first loved us.” (1 John 4:19) When we think of all that Jehovah has provided for us, we are motivated to show our deep appreciation in return. Jesus set the example in doing this by obediently witnessing about God’s name and Kingdom. (John 14:31) We do well to consider some ways that we may show our appreciation for Jehovah’s love and the blessings that result.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Going From Mouse to House: </span><span class="font14">Jesus taught his disciples how to perform the Kingdompreaching work. His directions clearly indicate that they went from house to house, spreading the good news. (Luke 9:1-6; 10: 1-7) It takes love for God and neighbor to keep going from door to door when we meet up with apathy and opposition. In the process, however, we personally benefit because our faith becomes firmer, our conviction stronger, and our hope brighter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Working under angelic direction, we have found many who are hungering and thirsting for the truth. (Rev. 14:6) Householders have said that they had been praying for help when a Witness came to their door. Two Witnesses and a small child were going from house to house on a Caribbean island. When the adults decided that they would stop for the day, the child went ahead by himself to the next door and knocked. A young lady opened the door. When the adults saw this, they went over and talked to her. She invited them in and explained that she had just been praying for God to send the Witnesses to teach her the Bible!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Witnessing on the Streets: </span><span class="font14">Since it is very difficult in some areas to find people at home, street witnessing is an effective way to give people a witness. Furthermore, many people live in gated communities or high-security buildings where we cannot go from door to door. However, our appreciation for Jehovah’s love prompts us to take advantage of every possible means to contact people with the Kingdom message, including street witnessing.—Prov. 1: 20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> making Return Visits: </span><span class="font14">Since we are looking for those who are “conscious of their spiritual need,” we want to do what we can to satisfy that need. (Matt. 5:3) This requires that we return to water the seeds of truth that we planted. (1 Cor. 3:6-8) A sister in Australia placed a tract with a woman who did not seem to show much interest. Nevertheless, the sister persisted in trying to find her home again. When she finally contacted her, our sister found that after the initial visit, the woman had purchased an expensive Bible. The sister began a study with her!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Conducting Bible Studies: </span><span class="font14">This can be the most enjoyable and rewarding feature of our ministry. What a blessing it is to help people learn about Jehovah, to see them make changes in their lives to please him, and then to witness their Christian baptism in symbol of their dedication to God!—1 Thess. 2:20; 3 John 4.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> In the next issue, we will consider more ways in which we are blessed for showing appreciation for Jehovah’s love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> As the Sovereign Lord of the universe, Jehovah deserves the very best we have to give. (Mal. 1:6) Out of love for him, we have dedicated our lives to do his will. Thus, at the end of the day or at the end of the month, if we are confident that we have given the “firstfruits” of our time, talents, and strength in Jehovah’s service, then we personally have cause for exultation. (Prov. 3:9) If, however, our conscience bears witness against us, then we should consider what we can do to improve.—Rom. 2:15.</span></p></li>

Circumstances change. Abilities vary. Comparisons often lead to competition or feelings of worthlessness. (Gal. 5:26; 6:4) Jesus did not make comparisons. Rather, he gave commendation in accord with what a person was able to do.—Mark 14:6-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> In Jesus’ parable of the talents, each worker received talents “according to his own ability.” (Matt. 25:15) When the master returned and requested a report on their activity, those who had worked diligently in accord with their abilities and circumstances received commendation and entered into the joy of their master. (Matt. 25:21, 23) As we similarly stay busy in the work of Kingdom preaching, we can be confident of divine approval and have cause for exultation!</span></p></li></ul>

Why? Imagine that someone offered you a brochure that is written in a language you cannot read, perhaps with characters that are foreign to you. Would it be of interest to you, even if it contained beautiful illustrations? Likely not. Similarly, people who cannot read are easily intimidated by publications that have text. Therefore, prominent on each page are carefully prepared illustrations with arrows to guide the discussion from one illustration to the next.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12">been designed to study with those who have limited reading ability or are learning to read. This brochure can also be used as a teacher’s copy when studying with someone out of the </span><span class="font11">Listen to God </span><span class="font12">brochure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the top left corner of each two-page lesson is a question that is answered on those pages. Included with the illustrations are comments and cited scriptures. Toward the bottom corner of many of the pages is a shaded box with some additional points and Scripture citations that could be discussed, depending on the ability of the student.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> How to Use Them: </span><span class="font12">You may offer either brochure in the house-to-house ministry whenever you feel it is beneficial to do so, even when brochures are not the offer for the month. (See the box “How They May Be Offered.”) You could introduce it on a return visit by simply telling the interested person that you have something to show him and handing him a brochure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Since </span><span class="font11">Listen to God </span><span class="font12">does not have printed questions, the discussions will not be question-and-answer sessions such as you might normally have when studying out of the </span><span class="font11">Bible Teach </span><span class="font12">book. In every culture people enjoy hearing stories. So use the illustrations to tell the inspired stories that make up the Bible record. Explain what is being illustrated. Be enthusiastic. Invite the observations of the student. Read the scriptures at the bottom of the page, and reason with him on what they say.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Help the Student to Progress: </span><span class="font12">Hopefully, your discussion will awaken in your student a desire to learn how to read so that he can take in knowledge of Jehovah on his own. (Matt. 5:3; John 17:3) Therefore, if the discussions are from </span><span class="font11">Listen to God, </span><span class="font12">in time perhaps you can offer to teach the student how to read, and you can transfer the study to </span><span class="font11">Listen to God and Live Forever. </span><span class="font12">Regardless of the brochure you use, the student will not be ready for baptism once the brochure has been completed. You should transfer the study to the </span><span class="font11">Bible Teach </span><span class="font12">book or another appropriate publication that will give him a more rounded-out understanding of the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> People must listen to the Sovereign of the universe if they are to live forever. (Isa. 55:3) And Jehovah’s will is that “all sorts of men,” including those who are unable to read, learn how to listen to him.

Notice what we must do to live there. [Read Isaiah 55:3, which is cited at the top of page 3.] This tells us to ‘come to’ God and ‘listen’ to him. But how do we listen to God?” Turn to pages 4-5, and discuss the answer with him.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> At Pentecost 33 C.E., after receiving holy spirit, Jesus’ disciples “started to speak with different tongues” to those present from far-flung parts of the earth. (Acts 2:4) As a result, about 3,000 were baptized. Interestingly, it seems that most of the visitors also spoke a common language, likely Hebrew or Greek.

Other-language congregations may be preaching in the same neighborhoods. While the congregations may provide you with information on individuals they find who speak your language, the primary responsibility to find people to whom you can preach rests with your congregation or group. (See the box “Help One Another.”) Therefore, you may need to engage in the search work, whereby you make inquiries to locate those who speak a specific language. How can the search work be carried out?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Organizing the Search Work: The amount of time that is devoted to the search work in multilingual areas depends on local circumstances. For example, how many people in the community speak the language? How many publishers are there? How many addresses does the congregation or group already have? The congregation is not required to search every neighborhood equally but may choose to focus on the more populated areas within its territory boundary and on those areas that are a reasonable distance away. However, having a well-organized arrangement to search is important so that as many as possible can be given the opportunity to call on the name of Jehovah.—Rom. 10:13, 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> In order to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort in places where searching is necessary, the body of elders, particularly the service overseer, should organize and oversee the search work. (1 Cor. 9:26) In foreign-language groups, a qualified brother, preferably an elder or ministerial servant chosen by the body of elders of the sponsoring congregation, can take the lead. Many congregations and groups have a systematic arrangement to do preliminary research, </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">perh</span><span class="font12">aps using a directory or the Internet</span></p></li></ul>

(b) What are some ways to find people who speak your language? </span><span class="font12">to gather names common in the language. Then the search work is done by means of phone calls or visits to determine which addresses should be included in the territory. If it is practical to do so, the body of elders of a congregation that sponsors a group may arrange for the entire congregation to participate in the search work occasionally.—See the box “How to Find Those Who Speak Your Language.”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">If the congregation or group would like help to find those of their language to whom they can preach, the service overseer can contact the elders of other-language congregations nearby. It may be best to contact only congregations that are a reasonable distance away or that have a significant population of those who speak the language. The contacted congregations can then inform their publishers that if they find anyone who speaks that language, they should write down the address and give it to the service overseer to pass on to the congregation or group requesting help. The service overseers of the congregations involved can work out a mutually acceptable system of covering multilingual territory and directing interested ones to the appropriate congregation or group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If publishers find someone of another language who </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">shows definite interest </span><span class="font4">(or someone who is deaf), they should </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">promptly</span><span class="font4"> fill out a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Please Follow Up </span><span class="font4">(S-43) form and give it to the congregation secretary.

Since this activity is part of the ministry, we should generally dress as ministers. Many find that practicing their presentations and speaking the language while searching helps them maintain enthusiasm and sharpens their language skills. We may count the time we spend searching but not the time spent preparing territory maps and lists. When we find someone who speaks the language, we should endeavor to share the good news and thereafter promptly inform the service overseer or someone designated by him so that territory records can be updated. This is true regardless of whether the person showed interest. Although the search work is important, we should be balanced and share in all features of the ministry.—See the box “What to Say in the Search Work.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Searching for Those Who Are Deaf: Searching for deaf people has unique challenges and requires significant effort and persistence. A deaf person cannot be identified by the spelling of his name, by his physical characteristics, or by his dress. In addition, family members and friends can be protective and may hesitate to provide information to publishers who inquire. The following suggestions for searching for the deaf may also be helpful when searching for those who use a spoken language.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Sign-language congregations and groups have had success making inquiries in residential areas. Perhaps the householder has observed a neighbor, workmate, or schoolmate using sign language. He may have noticed a street sign alerting neighbors that deaf children are present. Maybe he has a deaf relative. Keep in mind that the purpose of your visit may be viewed with some suspicion. However, you can do much to put </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">the h</span><span class="font12">ouseholder at ease by your genuine</span></p></li></ul>

Some have had good results by displaying the Bible or other DVDs as they inquire whether the householder knows someone who is deaf.

If the householder hesitates to provide information, he may be willing to accept your address card or a congregation meeting invitation to give to his deaf relative or friend.</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font4"> Use a telephone directory to find names that are common in the language. A reverse directory that sorts names according to address may be available on the Internet or through the telephone company.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font4"> Discreetly inquire at places that offer services to the public, such as local libraries, government offices, and colleges.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font4"> Check the local newspaper for announcements regarding public activities arranged by the foreign-language community.</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font4"> With permission from those in charge, set up a literature table at a business, university student center, or transportation center frequented by people who speak the language.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">•</span><span class="font4"> If allowed by law in your country, purchase a commercial directory or a computer program that searches public areas of the Internet.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> One or two days a year, a sign-language congregation might invite a nearby congregation of a different language to help them search one of the metropolitan areas within their large territory. A meeting for service conducted by the sign-language congregation could include instructions for this activity and a demonstration. Each car group can be assigned at least one publisher from the sign-language congregation and be given a map showing a specific area to search.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Searching can also be done where deaf people are known to gather for association and recreation or to obtain helpful services offered in the community. Publishers should wear attire that is appropriate for the setting. It may be best to converse with one or two people present and to be discreet rather than giving a presentation to the entire group. If the conversation is productive, perhaps contact information can be exchanged.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> Another option is to prepare maps that show local businesses and then to visit them at an appropriate time. One map might include a number of gas stations. Another might have dry cleaners, laundries, restaurants, hotels, or another type of business. If each map has the same type of business, publishers can use the same approach and gain experience and skill. For example, since hotels usually accommodate deaf customers, we might briefly explain our work to the desk clerk and offer a prepared packet containing a DVD and a congregation meeting invitation for the hotel to give to deaf guests. At some businesses we can simply inquire if any workers or regular patrons use sign language. If there is a school for the deaf in the territory, we could offer some of our DVD </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">publi</span><span class="font12">cations for the library.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> An Important Work: Finding householders who speak your language can be tedious. In addition, the makeup of some neighborhoods can change rapidly as people move in and out, making it challenging to keep territory records up-to-date. Nonetheless, in an increasing number of areas, the search work is an important aspect of the ministry. Jehovah, who has given us the assignment to preach, is not partial. (Acts 10: 34) His “will is that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) Therefore, may we cooperate with Jehovah and one another to find people of all languages who have “a fine </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">and g</span><span class="font12">ood heart.”—Luke 8:15.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>What to Say in the Search Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A friendly, sincere, and open approach will dispel suspicion. It is often helpful first to show literature in the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After giving a greeting, you might say: “We’re looking for those who speak___so thatwe canshare the Bi</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ble’s hope with them. Do you know anyone we might talk to?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When searching for the deaf, you could say: “Hello. May I show you something? [Using a portable video player, play a verse from the New </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation—On DVD.]</span><span class="font4"> This is a portion of the Bible in American Sign Language. In addition to the Bible, we have a numberof videos available at no charge that are designed to meet the spiritual needs of deaf people. Do you know of anyone who is deaf or hard of hearing and who uses sign language?” If the householder cannot remember anyone, it is often good to give examples of places where he may have seen a deaf person, such as at work, at school, or in the neighborhood.</span></p>

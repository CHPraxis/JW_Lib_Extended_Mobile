(Isa. 54:17) </span><span class="font11">Discussion based on the 2012 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font11"> page 125, paragraph 1, to page 126, paragraph 3, and page 181, paragraph 2.

<p><span class="font11">Song 44 and Prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Use an Approach That Works</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Early Christians preached the good news to people of diverse cultures and religions. (Col. 1:23) Although the message was the same—God’s Kingdom—the approach varied according to the audience. For example, when Peter spoke to Jews who had a deep respect for the Scriptures, he began by quoting the prophet Joel. (Acts 2:14-17) On the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">other</span><span class="font12"> hand, notice the way Paul reasoned</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. What can we learn from the varied approach of early Christians?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">with Greeks as recorded at Acts 17:22-31. Today, people in some territories respect the Scriptures, and we can freely refer to the Bible as we go from house to house. However, we may need to be more discreet when speaking to those who have no interest in the Bible or in religion or who belong to a non-Christian religion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Use the Literature Offer Effectively: </span><span class="font12">Literature offers for this service year will change every two months and will highlight magazines, tracts, and brochures. Even if people in our territory are generally not interested in the Bible, we will still be able to present something that addresses their interests. We might not read a scripture on the initial visit or directly refer to the Bible, but when interest is shown we can return with the objective of helping the householder to build faith in the Creator and his inspired Word. On the other hand, if we are preaching where people appreciate the Bible, we can use literature and an approach that reflect this. In fact, we may offer the Bible Teach book or the Listen to God or Listen to God and Live Forever brochures at any time, regardless of what is being featured for the month. The main thing is to use an approach that works.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Prepare the Soil: </span><span class="font12">A person’s heart is much like soil. (Luke 8:15) Some soil needs more preparation before seeds of Bible truth can take root and grow. First-century evan-gelizers successfully planted in all types of soil, and this brought them satisfaction and joy. (Acts 13:48, 52) We can experience similar success by giving attention to our ap</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">proac</span><span class="font12">h.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">2. How can we use the literature offer to help those who appreciate the Bible as well as those who do not?</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>(Part1)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">As youths grow to adulthood, they must make important decisions. To help them, the video Young People Ask —What Will I Do With My Life? has been prepared. On the main menu, select Play Drama, then see if you can answer the questions in paragraph 2. Afterward, select Inter views on the main menu, then select Looking Back, and then try to answer the questions in paragraph 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Drama: (1) In what ways was Timothy’s situation similar to that of many Christian youths today? (2) How was Andre pressured to excel in athletics? (3) What did Brother Fleissig tell Andre about (a) being dedicated to Jehovah as well as to a sport? (Matt. 6: 24) (b) the source of true happiness? (c) what his bowl from the concentration camp reminded him of? (d) the people in the picture with him and his wife? (e) whether he regretted giving up his dreams? (Phil. 3:8) (4) How did Andre’s grandmother answer his question, “Is it wrong for me to want to become a track star?” (Luke 4:5-7) (5) Did winning the race bring Andre real satisfaction? (6) What did you appreciate about Brother Fleissig’s final letter to Andre? (Prov. 10:22) (7) What did Brother Fleissig help Andre to discover?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Looking Back: (8) What careers were the brother and the sister pursuing, and why? (9) How successful had they become? (10) What was the turning point in each one’s life? (2 Cor. 5: 15) (11) What theocratic careers replaced their former ones, and why did they feel that they could not pursue both? (12) Did they have any regrets for having changed their focus in life? (13) What did they say that has especially made you think about what you should do with your life?</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Song 115 and Prayer</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font16"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Direct Your Blows Wisely</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul wrote: “The way I am running is not uncertainly; the way I am directing my blows is so as not to be striking the air.” (1 Cor. 9:26) Paul was referring to his single-mindedness and sharp focus in pursuing spiritual goals. However, in prin</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ciple,</span><span class="font14"> these words also apply to the minis-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">1. First Corinthians 9:26 has what application to the ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">try. We want to direct our “blows,” or efforts, wisely so that they will accomplish the most good. How?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Go Where the People Are: Paul and other first-century evangelizers preached where they expected people to be. (Acts 5: 42; 16:13; 17:17) So if many in our territory are at home in the evening, this may be the best time to go from house to house. Is the local bus or train station busy in the early mornings and late afternoons when people are going to work or returning home? When are the shopping areas in the territory filled with people? Street witnessing may be most productive during these times.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Work the Territory Wisely: Care should also be taken to direct our blows wisely in the way we work our territory. For example, instead of taking a very large group into the same area, where much time and effort will be required to keep the group organized and busy, it may be better to divide the group. Similarly, when working rural territory, we will cover the territory faster and have more opportunities to speak if car groups are not too large. Could we obtain a personal territory near our home, which would reduce the time needed for travel?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Jesus likened evangelizers to “fishers of men.” (Mark 1:17) A fisherman’s objective is not simply to fish but to catch fish. Therefore, successful fishermen go where and when they expect to find fish, and they begin fishing without delay. Yes, they direct their efforts wisely. May we show similar in</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">dustr</span><span class="font14">iousness in our ministry.—Heb. 6:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">2. How can we imitate Paul and other first-century evangelizers in selecting when and where to preach?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">3. How can we direct our blows wisely in the way we work our territory?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">4. What will help us to be successful “fishers of men”?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> A skilled craftsman has many tools, and he knows when and how to use each one. Similarly, we have various tools to help us fulfill our work as evangelizers. For example, brochures on a variety of subjects have been produced to help us preach to “people of all sorts.” (1 Cor. 9:22) The enclosed supplement lists some of these brochures, explains whom they were designed for, and suggests how the brochures might be offered.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">How to offer </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it to an older person who is a Buddhist:</span><span class="font14"> “Perhaps you are as concerned as I am about the current flood of degraded ideas and the effect that these are having on our children. Why, do you think, is there such an increase in immorality among young people? [Allow for response.] Did you know that this was foretold in a book that started to be written long before the founding of the Christian, Hindu, and Muslim religions? [Read 2 Timothy 3:1-3.] Note that these conditions prevail despite continuous learning. [Read verse 7.] The information in this publication helped me to understand truths that most people never learn. Would you like to read it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might try this:</span><span class="font14"> On a future return visit, after cultivating the householder’s interest in the Bible, show him the questions on the back cover, and point out the coupon for the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font14"> book. Explain that you brought along a copy if he wants to see it. Show him the book’s table of contents, and consider a paragraph or two in the chapter of his choosing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How to offer it:</span><span class="font14"> “Many people whom we have talked to are distressed by the wickedness they see in the world. Do you think that God will one day rid this world of its problems? [Allow for response.] This prophecy gives hope. [Read Psalm 37:11.] What I just read is from the Bible, a book that has often been misunderstood and misused. You may be surprised to know that the Bible is not a Western book; it does not promote colonialism or the superiority of one race over another. But it does give us hope that God will soon remove our problems. It also contains principles that can help us manage our problems right now. This brochure provides more information.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might try this:</span><span class="font14"> On a future return visit, after cultivating the householder’s interest in the Bible, show him the pictures on pages 4-5 of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font14"> book.

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How to offer it:</span><span class="font14"> “Throughout history humans have experienced much suffering as a result of war. Why, do you think, do we continue to have wars even though people say they want peace? [Allow for response.] This prophecy from Isaiah gives hope. [Read Isaiah 2:4.] However, this raises several questions: When and how will Isaiah’s prophecy be fulfilled? Why can we trust the Scriptures to be a reliable source of hope? This brochure answers these questions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might try this:</span><span class="font14"> If the brochure is accepted, refer the householder to pages 16-17 and say: “Many point to atrocities such as the Holocaust and ask, ‘If God exists, why does he permit suffering?’ We can discuss this when I return.”</span></p>

Is that correct? [Allow for response.] I would like to talk with you about an ancient prophecy that foretells the transformation of the earth into a paradise. May I read to you what the prophet wrote? [Read Isaiah 11:6-9.] Many have wondered just how God will bring such changes to the earth. This brochure shows what the prophets say on this subject.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might try this:</span><span class="font14"> If the householder accepts the brochure, say: “This book of God explains that in the beginning, man lived in paradise.

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might try this:</span><span class="font14"> At the end of the initial call, ask the householder to choose one of the questions on the back cover.

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font16"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Are You Prepared for a Medical Emergency?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">A medical emergency can occur suddenly and without warning. (Jas. 4:14) Therefore, one who is shrewd will prepare as much as possible. (Prov. 22:3) Have you decided what medical treatments and procedures you will accept, and have you put your decision in writing? To help you, the video TransfusionAlternative Health Care—Meeting Patien t Needs and Rights, the second presentation on the DVD entitled Transfusion-Alternatives—Documentary Series, has been produced. As you watch it, see if you can answer the following questions. Because the video includes brief surgical scenes, parents should use discretion in viewing it with young children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(1) </span><span class="font15">Why are some in the medical community reevaluating the use of blood transfusions? </span><span class="font14">(2) </span><span class="font15">Give three examples of complex surgeries that have been performed without blood transfusions. </span><span class="font14">(3) </span><span class="font15">Why are thousands of physicians and surgeons worldwide willing to treat patients without blood transfusions? </span><span class="font14">(4) </span><span class="font15">What have recent hospital studies revealed about blood use? </span><span class="font14">(5) </span><span class="font15">What are the medical risks associated with blood transfusions? </span><span class="font14">(6) </span><span class="font15">What have many experts concluded regarding the benefits of transfusion alternatives? </span><span class="font14">(7) </span><span class="font15">What causes anemia, and what can be done to compensate for it? </span><span class="font14">(8) </span><span class="font15">How can red-cell production be stimulated in a patient’s body? </span><span class="font14">(9) </span><span class="font15">What techniques are being used to minimize blood loss during surgery? </span><span class="font14">(10) </span><span class="font15">Can transfusion alternatives work for young children or for people involved in life-threatening emergencies? </span><span class="font14">(11) </span><span class="font15">What is one of the primary ethical principles of good medical care?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Have you decided what medical treatments and procedures you will accept and put this in writing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Since acceptance of some of the treatments featured in the video is a matter of conscience, do not wait until you are faced with an emergency to consider what you will or will not accept. Chapter 7 of the “God’s Love” book and the cited references as well as the insert in the November 2006 issue of Our Kingdom Ministry will help you make informed decisions. Then, if you are baptized, indicate your choices on the DPA card, and carry the card with you at all times.</span></p>

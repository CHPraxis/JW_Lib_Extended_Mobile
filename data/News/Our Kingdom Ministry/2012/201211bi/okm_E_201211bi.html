<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark5"></a>See Good for Your Hard Work</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Man was designed to “see good because of his hard work.” (Eccl. 2:24) However, when we fail to see good results from our ministry, discouragement can rob us of joy and dampen our zeal. What can help us to maintain a positive attitude?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Have Realistic Expectations: Remem-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. What could dampen our zeal for the ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. Why should we have realistic expectations about the response to our ministry? </span><span class="font7">ber that although those who responded to Jesus were few, his ministry was unquestionably a success. ( John 17:4) In his illustration of the sower, Jesus foretold that most hearts would ultimately not be receptive to the seedlike Kingdom message. (Matt. 13:3-8, 18-22) Nonetheless, our diligent efforts still accomplish much.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> How We Bear Much Fruit: According to Jesus’ illustration, those who accept the message would “bear fruit.” (Matt. 13:23) After a wheat stalk sprouts and matures, the fruit it produces is not little wheat stalks, but new seed. So the fruitage that successful Christians produce is, not necessarily new disciples, but the many-fold duplication of Kingdom seed—our expressions about the Kingdom. This results in much “good” from which we can obtain satisfaction, regardless of whether people respond. We are contributing to the sanctification of Jehovah’s name. (Isa. 43:10-12; Matt. 6:9) We are enjoying the privilege of being God’s fellow workers. (1 Cor. 3:9) And such “fruit of lips” delights Jehovah.—Heb. 13:15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> In addition, our hard work may be having results that we do not see. It is possible that some who heard Jesus preach did not become his disciples until after he finished his earthly ministry. Similarly, Kingdom seed that we sow may not take root and grow in a person’s heart until later, and he may come into the truth without our knowing. Indeed, our ministry accomplishes a great deal of good. Therefore, may we “keep bearing much fruit” and prove </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ourse</span><span class="font7">lves Jesus’ disciples.—John 15:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">3. How may we “bear fruit” even ifwe see little response to our preaching?</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Do Not Limit Yourself —Overcoming Feelings of Inadequacy</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Do you hold back from offering a Bible study because you are not confident in your ability to conduct one effectively? At times faithful servants in the past, such as Moses and Jeremiah, felt unqualified for their assignments. (Ex. 3:10, 11; 4:10; Jer. 1:4-6) Therefore, such feelings are not uncom</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">mon</span><span class="font7">. How can they be overcome?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. Why do some hold back from offering a Bible study?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> We should remember that Jehovah never asks us to do something that is beyond our ability. (Ps. 103:14) So our commission to “make disciples,” “teaching them,” is one that we can fulfill. (Matt. 28:19, 20) It is not a privilege that Jehovah has bestowed upon only the most experienced or the most talented among us. (1 Cor. 1:26, 27) Therefore, we should not be content to limit our ministry to the door-to-door preaching work and leave the Bible study activity for others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Jehovah Qualifies Us: </span><span class="font7">Our qualifications to make disciples issue from Jehovah. (2 Cor. 3:5) Through his organization he has taught us Bible truths that even the most educated people in this world do not know. (1 Cor. 2:7, 8) He has preserved a record of the teaching methods of the Great Teacher, Jesus, for us to imitate, and he gives us ongoing training through the congregation. In addition, Jehovah has not left us to formulate our own curriculum for teaching the Bible. He has provided tools, such as the Bible Teach book, that outline the truth in a logical and easy-to-understand way. Conducting a Bible study may be less challenging than we think.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Moses and Jeremiah were able to fulfill their assignments with Jehovah’s help. (Ex. 4:11, 12; Jer. 1:7, 8) We too can ask Jehovah to help us. After all, when we conduct a Bible study, we are teaching someone the truth about Jehovah, which is pleasing in God’s eyes. (1 John 3:22) Therefore, make it your goal to share in the Bible study work, a most enjoyable and rewarding feature of the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">mini</span><span class="font7">stry.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Do Not Limit Yourself</span><br><br><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>—Dealing With a Busy Schedule</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Some hesitate to offer a Bible study because they have a busy schedule. Caring for a Bible student takes time. Time is needed to prepare for the study, to conduct it, and to help the student overcome personal obstacles. The apostle Paul said that he imparted his soul to help those in Thessalonica come to know Jehovah. (1 Thess. 2:7, 8) How can we conduct a Bi</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ble s</span><span class="font7">tudy even if we have a full schedule?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. Why do some hesitate to offer a Bible study?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Worship Takes Time: The simple truth is that worship requires time. For example, we regularly take time to attend the meetings, to share in the ministry, to read the Bible, and to pray. A busy married person will happily make time to spend with his or her mate. How much more should we gladly ‘buy out’ time to worship Jehovah because we love him. (Eph. 5:15-17; 1 John 5:3) According to Jesus, a vital part of our worship is the disciple-making work. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Reflecting on this will help us not to hold back from accepting the responsibility of conducting a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> But what if our schedule is disrupted by employment, chronic health problems, or theocratic assignments? Some publishers who must occasionally be away conduct their Bible study over the phone or by computer conference. Those whose schedule is disrupted by chronic health problems have arranged for the student to come to their home for the study. Some have arranged for a reliable publisher to be their back-up and conduct the study when they are not available.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Paul got much joy from giving of his time and energy to help others learn the truth. (Acts 20:35) When he contemplated the fruitage of his labor in Thessalo-nica, he was moved to thank Jehovah. (1 Thess. 1:2) Our joy and satisfaction in the ministry can be increased if we do not let a busy schedule limit us from par</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ticip</span><span class="font7">ating in the Bible study work.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6">2. How does love for Jehovah affect how we use our time?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Memorial to Be Observed on April 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22:19) With those words, Jesus commanded his followers to commemorate his sacrificial death. In view of all that the ransom accomplished, there is no day more important or precious for Christians than the </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">annu</span><span class="font8">al Memorial observance. As this year’s</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">1. Why is the Memorial observance important? observance on April 5 approaches, how may we show our thankfulness to Jehovah?—Col. 3:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Prepare: We normally prepare for the things that we consider important. We can prepare our hearts for the Memorial by considering as a family the events that occurred during Jesus’ final days on earth and by meditating on them. (Ezra 7:10) A partial list of scriptures is found in the calendar and in Examining the Scriptures Daily, whereas a more complete listing, along with corresponding chapters from the Greatest Man book, is located on pages 23-24 of the February 1, 2011, issue of The Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Preach: We can also demonstrate our appreciation by having a full share in the ministry. (Luke 6:45) A worldwide campaign to invite others to the Memorial will begin on Saturday, March 17. Could you adjust your schedule to spend more time in the ministry, perhaps as an auxiliary pioneer? Why not discuss it as a family during your next Family Worship evening?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> How we are benefited by sharing in the Memorial observance each year! Our joy and our love for God increase as we reflect on Jehovah’s generosity in providing his only-begotten Son as a ransom. (John 3:16; 1 John 4:9, 10) This compels us to live no longer for ourselves. (2 Cor. 5:14, 15) It also stimulates our desire to praise Jehovah publicly. (Ps. 102:19-21) Indeed, Jehovah’s grateful servants eagerly look forward to the opportunity we will have at the Memorial observance on April 5 to ‘proclaim the death of the Lord.’ —1 Cor. 11:26.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Witness in Business Territory With Confidence</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Do you find the thought of witnessing at businesses to be intimidating? If so, do not despair, for even Paul, who was a bold and fearless minister, had to ‘muster up boldness’ in order to preach. (1 Thess. 2:2) Below are some common concerns along with practical suggestions for addressing them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Will Interrupting the Workers Annoy Them? In many businesses, workers serve the public and expect interrup</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">tions</span><span class="font9">. They will often be polite, since</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. Why should we not despair if we feel that business witnessing is intimidating?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2. Why should we not worry about annoying the workers?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">they may view you as a potential customer. By dressing in a dignified manner and being warm and friendly, you will encourage respectful treatment.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Will I Have to Give My Presentation in Front of Many Customers? If possible, choose a time when stores are not overly busy, such as when they first open. Wait until the manager or clerk is alone before approaching him. Make your presentation very brief.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> What Should I Say? Speak to the person in charge if there are several workers. You might say: “It’s hard to find businesspeople at home, so we’re visiting you at your workplace. I know you’re working, so I’ll be very brief.” So that we will not be confused with salesmen, it is usually best not to mention the donation arrangement unless we are asked how our work is financed. Depending on the nature of the business, you may ask the manager for permission to speak briefly to the workers. Repeat your presentation to them. If a worker seems busy, shorten your presentation and leave him a tract. If it is not possible to talk with the workers, perhaps you will be allowed to leave literature in the break room or other common area.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Jesus and Paul preached to people at their places of business with confidence, and so can you. (Matt. 4:18-21; 9:9; Acts 17:17) Ask Jehovah to help you to have a calm heart and to be bold. (Acts 4:29) Business territory has few not-at-homes, so why not give this productive form of </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">witn</span><span class="font9">essing a try?</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The Wonders of Creation Reveal God’s Glory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Many enjoy looking at creation. But few realize that as they do so, they are catching a glimpse into the mind and heart of our Grand Creator. (Rom. 1:20) Long ago, David learned about Jehovah through His inspired Word. But he also “saw” and drew close to Him through creation. (Ps. 8:3, 4) The video entitled The Wonders of Creation Reveal God’s Glory helps us, our children, and our Bible students to take a close look at some of Jehovah’s creation, see the qualities and personality of our Grand Creator, and as a result draw closer to him. After viewing the video, see if you can answer the following questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(1) How does the size and order of the physical universe deepen your appreciation of Jehovah? (Isa. 40:26) (2) When we look closer at water, what can we learn about the One who designed it? (Rev. 14:7) (3) How does the earth’s size and proximity to the sun demonstrate Jehovah’s wisdom? (4) What purpose does the moon serve? (Ps. 89:37) (5) How has Jehovah designed humans to enjoy life? (6) What is DNA? (Ps. 139:16) (7) Of all Jehovah’s earthly creations, how are humans different? (Gen. 1:26) (8) What do you look forward to in the new world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Extra Features: (9) Where do colors come from? (10) How does water overcome gravity to reach the tops of trees? (11) What role does water play within our bodies? (12) Give examples of the harmony that exists between living things. (13) How do creatures know to form partnerships with others? (14) What is the “golden angle,” and how is it displayed in creation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Observe Intently” Jehovah’s Handiwork: Jesus encouraged us to “observe intently the birds of heaven” and to “take a lesson from the lilies of the field.” (Matt. 6:26, 28) Doing so can deepen our faith, instill confidence in the Creator, and build appreciation for Jehovah’s wisdom, saving power, and love. Rather than be unduly distracted by the works of this world, make the time and effort to observe the wonders of Jehovah’s creation, and reflect on what it tells us about our God.—Ps. 19:1.</span></p>

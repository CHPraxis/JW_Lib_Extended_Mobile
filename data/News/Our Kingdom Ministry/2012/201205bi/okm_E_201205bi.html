<p><span class="font11">in the Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> “As sheep amidst wolves,” God’s servants are preaching “among a crooked and twisted generation.” (Matt. 10:16; Phil. 2:15) Alarming reports of civil unrest, mob violence, and cruel kidnappings are commonplace, evidence of wicked men advancing “from bad to worse.” (2 Tim. 3:13) Apply</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing w</span><span class="font8">hat Scriptural principles will help us</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. Why is a cautious approach necessary in the ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">to ‘prove ourselves cautious’ in the minis-try?—Matt. 10:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Act Shrewdly: </span><span class="font8">Proverbs 22:3 emphasizes the wisdom of ‘concealing ourselves’ from calamity. Stay alert ! The conditions in a normally safe neighborhood can unexpectedly change. You may see an increase of police activity or crowds forming in the street. Sometimes a kind householder will provide a warning. Rather than lingering out of curiosity, it is shrewd to leave promptly and continue elsewhere. —Prov. 17:14; John 8:59; 1 Thess. 4:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Work Together: </span><span class="font8">“Two are better than one,” says Ecclesiastes 4:9. While you may have been accustomed to working safely alone in the ministry, is it now safe to do so? In some areas, it is. But in others, it now is ill-advised for a sister or a young person to work from door to door alone, especially after sunset. Experience has proved that an attentive partner is invaluable. (Eccl. 4:10, 12) Remain watchful over other members in your group. Make it your habit to let others know that you are leaving the territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> As ones ‘keeping watch over our souls,’ the elders are responsible to provide practical guidance according to the local circumstances. (Heb. 13:17) Jehovah’s blessing is assured as we demonstrate Christian modesty and cooperate fully with them. (Mic. 6:8; 1 Cor. 10:12) May all of God’s servants contribute to giving an effective witness in our </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">territ</span><span class="font8">ory, yet always with due caution.</span></p></li></ul>

This publication highlights lessons for our daily life found in the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Beneficial Today: Jeremiah, the writer of this inspired Bible book, prophesied during a turbulent period in Judah. At first, he did not feel qualified for his assignment. (Jer. 1:6) He was also persecuted by acquaintances and perhaps relatives from his hometown, Anathoth. (Jer. 11:21, 22) Understandably, Jeremiah became discouraged at times. (Jer. 20:14) As we fulfill our commission to “make disciples of people of all the nations,” we often experience challenges and feelings similar to those of Jeremiah. (Matt. 28:19) A consideration of his writings will help us to carry out our ministry with confidence and zeal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Features: Key scriptures that should be read during the discussion are identified in italics. The end of each week’s study is marked by a meaningful question or two set in bold that highlights the main points of the lesson. These should be asked of the audience in review. Throughout the book are beautiful illustrations that the congregation will no doubt want to comment on.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> To benefit to the full, prepare your lesson in advance. Look for points that you can use in your life and ministry. Have a full share in commenting. With Jehovah’s blessing, Jeremiah fulfilled his assignment with joy and contentment. (Jer. 15:16) May our consideration of this new publication help us to carry out our min</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">istry</span><span class="font8"> in the same way.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Part 2: Let the Light Shine</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">After Brother Rutherford and his associates were released from prison in 1919, a huge work lay ahead of the Bible Students. As depicted in the video Jehovah’s Witnesses—Faith in Action, Part 2: Let the Light Shine, the Bible Students would have many opposers, their understanding of the Scriptures would continue to grow, and their faith would be refined. (Prov. 4:18; Mal. 3:1-3; John 15:20) After viewing the video, can you answer these questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(1) What methods did the Bible Students use to spread the good news? (2) What happened at the landmark conventions in 1931 and 1935? (3) What was significant about the November 1, 1939, issue of The Watchtower? (4) Describe what occurred at Madison Square Garden during Brother Rutherford’ s talk “Government and Peace.” (5) What was noteworthy about Brother Knorr’s talk “Peace —Can It Last?” (6) In 1942, what plans did Jehovah’ s Witnesses make to expand their preaching work? (7) Explain some of the legal battles that were fought in the United States, Canada, and Greece. (8) What impact did Gilead have on the growth of the preaching work? (9) What important work began in 1946, and why? (10) What steps did Jehovah’s Witnesses take to make sure their conduct was in harmony with the standard set forth in the Bible? (11) Explain some of the adjustments that were made in the 1970’s to align the organization more closely with the pattern in the Bible. (12) How has viewing this video deepened your appreciation that Jehovah is in full control and that this is his organization? (13) How has this video strengthened your determination to continue zealously preaching despite obstacles? (14) How could we use this video to help our relatives, Bible students, and others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Each day that passes adds a new chapter to the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses. What will the record say about our efforts in the ministry? As our brothers have done in the past, may we zealously continue to “let the light shine”! —2 Cor. 4:6.</span></p>

It is also good to note that, so far this service year, 31 have been baptized. In Britain, January was a good month for Bible studies. The 129,696 publishers conducted 56,484 Bible studies. We rejoice to note that 194 were baptized, making a total of 1,136 this service year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Each Memorial season gives us new opportunities to “laud Jehovah very much.” (Ps. 109:30) Will you expand your ministry during March as one way to show appreciation to the ransom Provider? Now is the time </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">to be</span><span class="font11">gin making plans.—Prov. 21:5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. What is something significant about the Memorial season, and how can we prepare for it?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Auxiliary Pioneering: Last year congregations were abuzz with excitement when they learned of the provision to auxiliary pioneer in April with a reduced hour requirement. One brother wrote: “I am still in high school, and I have not found it possible for me to regular pioneer. But I am going to apply for 30 hours and strive for 50 hours in the month of April.” A sister who works full-time wrote: “Thirty hours—that is so very achievable!” When this provision was announced, one former pioneer, now in her 80’s, said: “This is the moment I’ve been waiting for! Jehovah knew pioneering was the best time of my life!” Others who could not auxiliary pioneer set goals to do more in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> March will be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer because we will again have the option of a 30- or a 50-hour requirement. In addition, beginning Saturday, March 17, we will participate in a special campaign to invite others to join us for the Memorial on April 5. Many will enjoy their enlarged share in the ministry so much that they will want to auxiliary pioneer in April and May too, with a 50-hour requirement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> During your next Family Worship evening, why not discuss how each one in the family can expand his ministry during the Memorial season? (Prov. 15:22) Ask Jehovah to bless your efforts. (1 John 3:22) As you enlarge your share in the ministry, not only will you add to your praise of Jehovah but </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">you w</span><span class="font11">ill also increase your joy.—2 Cor. 9:6.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>The Campaign to Advertise the Memorial Begins March 17</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Memorial observance each year serves to proclaim the death of Jesus. (1 Cor. 11:26) Therefore, we want others to attend with us and hear about Jehovah’s loving gift of the ransom. (John 3:16) This year our campaign to invite people to come to the Memorial will begin on Saturday, March 17. Are you looking forward to having a full share?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. What campaign will begin on March 17?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> What We Could Say: It is best to have a brief presentation. We might say: “Hello. We’re here to give your family this invitation to an important annual observance that will be held worldwide on April 5. A free Bible talk will be given that explains what Jesus’ death accomplished and what he is doing now. This invitation shows the address and time of the meeting being held in our community.” When sharing in the distribution on the weekends, we should also offer the magazines when appropriate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Invite as Many as Possible: Our goal is to invite as many people as possible. So make sure to invite your Bible students, return visits, relatives, workmates, schoolmates, neighbors, and other acquaintances. The local elders will provide direction on how to cover your territory. Our annual campaign to invite people to the Memorial produces results. When a woman walked into the auditorium last year, an attendant offered to help her find the publisher who invited her. However, the woman said that she did not know anyone there and that she received her invitation from someone going from house to house earlier that day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Perhaps someone in attendance at your Memorial will be there because of an invitation left by you. Whether someone responds or not, your diligent efforts will still provide a witness. The invitations you distribute will proclaim that Jesus is now a powerful King. Your zealous participation will demonstrate to all observers—those in the territory, fellow publishers, and most importantly, Jeho-vah—that you deeply appreciate the gift of the ransom.—Col. 3:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">2. What could we say to present the invitation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. How may we invite as many people as possible?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10">The study edition of The Watchtower is now available in a simplified English edition. This edition is provided for (1) English-speaking publishers who would benefit from simplified wording, perhaps because of limited education; (2) publishers whose first language is not English; (3) young people, including those in elementary and middle school; and (4) Bible students who need simpler, more direct language to understand spiritual matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The paragraph numbers, questions, and headings correspond to the standard edition. The material is exactly the same, but the wording is simpler. Although the Watchtower Study conductor and reader will use the standard edition unless most in the audience are using the simplified edition, those using the simplified edition will see the same cited scriptures and the same illustrations and will be able to follow the reading of the paragraphs and to share in commenting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Any who feel they would benefit should place a standing request with the magazine servant.</span></p>

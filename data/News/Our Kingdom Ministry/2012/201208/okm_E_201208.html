That is why the special assembly day program for the 2013 service year, which begins on September 1, 2012, has as its theme “Safeguard Your Conscience.” (1 Tim. 1:19) The program has been designed to help each of us give serious attention to how we are utilizing this remarkable gift from our Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font9">Look for These Points: </span><span class="font10">The program will answer seven principal questions regarding conscience:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> With Jehovah’s help we can withstand the efforts of Satan to corrupt our conscience. By means of God’s Word and organization, our loving heavenly Father is telling us: “This is the way. Walk in it.” (Isa. 30:21) This program is one way Jehovah is providing such guidance. Therefore, make arrangements to be in attendance for the entire program. Pay close attention, and consider how to apply the information personally. Talk about the program as a family. Our putting into practice the instruction we receive will strengthen us to continue to “hold a good conscience” and help us avoid being lured off course by the fleeting pleasures of Satan’s world.—1 Pet. 3:16.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Safeguard Your Mind</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jesus instructed his disciples to love Jehovah with their whole heart, soul, and mind. (Matt. 22:37, 38) This year’s conventions and circuit events have been designed to help us strengthen the person we are on the inside. As you will recall, the theme of our district convention was “Safeguard Your Heart!” The special assembly day program </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">for t</span><span class="font10">he 2013 service year has as its theme</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1. What is the theme of the circuit assembly for the 2013 service year, and what is the purpose of the program?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Safeguard Your Conscience.” And the series of circuit assemblies that begins next month will feature the theme “Safeguard Your Mind,” based on Matthew 22:37. This program is designed to help each of us to analyze our own thoughts with a view to making them more pleasurable to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What Will Be Presented: </span><span class="font10">As we listen to the circuit assembly, we should look for the answers to these questions, which represent the main points:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font10"> How can we avoid thinking 'man's thoughts’?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font10"> How can we help lift the veil that blinds the minds of unbelievers?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font10"> What mental attitude do we want to have?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font10"> What are the benefits of proper meditation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font10"> How can we allow Jehovah to mold our thinking?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font10"> How can husbands, wives, parents, and children contribute to family happiness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font10"> How can we be ready for Jehovah’s day?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font10"> What does it mean to brace up our minds for activity?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">•</span><span class="font10"> What benefit comes to those who apply what they learn?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Satan is waging a battle for our minds and is seeking to corrupt them. (2 Cor. 11:3) Therefore, we must protect our minds and control our thoughts. We need to continue reflecting the mind of Christ and fight against the influences of this lawless world. (1 Cor. 2:16) So make arrangements to attend both days of the circuit assembly. Pay close attention. Applying the vital information presented will help us to brace up our minds for zealous Kingdom service.—1 Pet. 1:13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">2. We should look for the answers to what questions during the program?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">3. Why is it important that we attend both days, pay close attention, and apply what we learn?</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. In the prophecy recorded at Ezekiel 17:22-24, who is the “tender one,” what is the “high and lofty mountain” to which he is transplanted, and in what way will he become “a majestic cedar”? [July 16, w07 7/1 pp. 12-13 par. 6]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. According to the proverbial saying referred to at Ezekiel 18:2, whom were Ezekiel’s fellow exiles blaming for their suffering, and what valuable lesson can we learn from this account? [July 23, w88 9/15 p. 18 par. 10]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">5. How does the incident recorded at Ezekiel 21:18-22 show that neither humans nor demons can alter Jehovah’s purpose? [July 30, w07 7/1 p. 14 par. 4]</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Adjustments to Midweek Meeting</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Beginning the week of September 3, the Congregation Bible Study will be lengthened from 25 to 30 minutes. In his introductory comments, the conductor should take one minute to review the previous lesson. The timing of the Service Meeting will also be adjusted from 35 to 30 minutes. There will no longer be a separate part for announcements. Instead, any announcements should be given at the beginning of the first scheduled part. In most instances, few, if any, announcements will be necessary, and there is no need to outline what will be presented on the meeting. Announcements regarding field service and cleaning schedules, as well as greetings, should not be made. (km 10/08 p. 1, par. 4) If a lengthy announcement will be presented, it will be helpful if those participating in the meeting know in advance so that they can shorten their part.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">To Start Bible Studies on the First Saturday in September</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Many believe that God will one day judge them according to their deeds. Do you think Judgment Day is something to look forward to or to dread? [Allow for response.] Notice what this says.” Hand the householder the September 1 Watchtower, and consider together material under the first subheading on page 16 and at least one of the scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Announcing Jehovah's Kingdom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“In many parts of the world, women suffer discrimination and mistreatment. Sadly, religious beliefs have contributed to this. Do you think God really cares about women? [Allow for response.] Notice how the Bible instructs husbands to treat their wives. [Read Ephesians 5:28, 29.] This magazine shows what the Bible reveals about God’s view of women.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“Many say that life on earth will end one day, perhaps from a nuclear war or a natural disaster, such as an asteroid or global climate change. Do you think such doomsday predictions have merit, or do you think they’re just fantasy? [Allow for response.] The Bible makes this comforting promise. [Read Psalm 37: 29.] This magazine examines some common doomsday scenarios as well as the Bible’s reasonable version of what the future holds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service Highlights</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We are happy to report six new all-time peaks during the month of March. The Bahamas reported 177 regular pioneers, 44,075 hours, and 2,306 Bible studies. The Turks and Caicos Islands reported 9,929 hours, 3,470 return visits, and 784 Bible studies. In addition to these peaks, support forthe auxiliary pioneer service was excellent. Auxiliary pioneers totaled 370,804 in the United States, 551 in the Bahamas, 187 in Bermuda, and 81 in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Without question, Jehovah’s people are ‘working hard and exerting themselves’ in pure worship. —1 Tim. 4:10.</span></p>

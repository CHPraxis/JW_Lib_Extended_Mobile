<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Three Tips for Improving Your Teaching</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> All Christian ministers are teachers. Whether we are making the initial call, returning to further the interest, or conducting a Bible study, we are imparting information. </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">And t</span><span class="font12">he information we teach is not ordinary.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. Why should we seek to improve our teaching?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">We are shedding light on “the holy writings,” which can make people “wise for salvation.” (2 Tim. 3:15) What an awesome privilege! Here are three tips for improving our teaching.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Simplicity: </span><span class="font12">When we know a subject well, it can be easy to forget how complicated the information may seem to someone who does not. So when conducting a Bible study, do not clutter your teaching with a lot of unnecessary details. Instead, highlight the main points. A lot of talking does not necessarily mean better teaching. (Prov. 10:19) It is generally best to read only the key scriptures. After reading a scripture, focus on the aspect under consideration. The Sermon on the Mount, recorded at Matthew chapters 5 to 7, contains very profound truths, and yet Jesus taught with simplicity and an economy of words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Illustrations: </span><span class="font12">Illustrations stimulate thinking, stir emotions, and aid in remembering. Do not feel that you must be a storyteller to give good illustrations. Jesus often used short, uncomplicated ones. (Matt. 7:3-5; 18: 2-4) Simple pictures drawn on a piece of paper can also be very useful. With a little forethought, you can come up with effective illustrations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Questions: </span><span class="font12">Questions require your student to think. Therefore, be patient after you ask a question. If you quickly give the answer yourself, you will not really know what your student understands. If he answers wrongly, it may be better to lead him to the correct conclusion with additional questions instead of simply correcting him. (Matt. 17:24-27) Of course, none of us are perfect teachers. Therefore, the Bible encourages us to pay constant attention to our teaching. Our doing so will bring everlasting benefits to us and to those </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">listen</span><span class="font12">ing to us.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">2. How can we teach with simplicity?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. What is the value of illustrations, and what kind are often the best?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">4. How can we use questions effectively?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">In the Bible, light is associated with truth, whereas darkness is associated with falsehood. (Ps. 43:3; Isa. 5:20) Satan introduced darkness into the world when he deceived Eve, and eventually he plunged mankind into deep darkness. (Rev. 12:9) The video Jehovah’s Witnesses—Faith in Action, Part 1: Out of Darkness chronicles how spiritual light began to emerge from darkness. (Isa. 60: 1, 2) After viewing the video, can you answer these questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(1) </span><span class="font13">How did deep darkness develop after the death of the apostles? </span><span class="font12">(2) </span><span class="font13">Beginning in the 1100’s, what developments helped people to discern that the church had gone off course? </span><span class="font12">(3) </span><span class="font13">Who were Henry Grew and George Storrs? </span><span class="font12">(4) </span><span class="font13">What events in the life of Charles Russell had a profound effect on him? </span><span class="font12">(5) </span><span class="font13">How did Brother Russell, his father, and a few acquaintances carry out their Bible study class, and what Scriptural conclusions did they come to? </span><span class="font12">(6) </span><span class="font13">How did this Bible study group come to merge with Nelson Barbour’s group, but what caused Brother Russell to withdraw? </span><span class="font12">(7) </span><span class="font13">What occurred in July 1879 that began a new era of spiritual light? </span><span class="font12">(8) </span><span class="font13">Thereafter, what did the growing number of Bible Students do to spread the good news? </span><span class="font12">(9) </span><span class="font13">Years in advance, what did the Bible Students expect to occur in 1914? </span><span class="font12">(10) </span><span class="font13">What challenges did the Bible Students face after Brother Russell died? </span><span class="font12">(11) </span><span class="font13">What did the Bible Students do after Brother Rutherford and his associates were released from prison? </span><span class="font12">(12) </span><span class="font13">How has viewing this video deepened your appreciation for Jehovah’s organization? </span><span class="font12">(13) </span><span class="font13">How has this video strengthened your determination to continue zealously preaching despite obstacles? </span><span class="font12">(14) </span><span class="font13">How could we use this video to help our relatives, Bible students, and others?</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Ancient Israelites gathered three times a year for seasonal festivals. Although only the males were required to attend, often entire families traveled to Jerusalem to enjoy these happy conventions. (Deut. 16:15, 16) Such events gave opportunity to reflect on and discuss important spiritual truths. What are some of these truths? One is that Jehovah is a generous, loving Provider. (Deut. 15:4, 5) Another is that he can be relied on for guidance and protection. (Deut. 32:9, 10) Israelites could also reflect on the fact that as a people for Jehovah’s name, they must properly reflect his righteousness. (Deut. 7:6, 11) Today our annual district conventions benefit us similarly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Program Shines Light on Truth: </span><span class="font12">At our district conventions, we enjoy talks, dramas, demonstrations, and interviews that shine light on vital Bible truths.

<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Seat Saving: </span><span class="font12">Seats may be saved only for those living in your home or traveling in your vehicle or for your current Bible students. —1 Cor. 13:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Noon Meal: </span><span class="font12">Please bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers and glass containers are not permitted in the convention facility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Donations: </span><span class="font12">We can show our appreciation for the convention arrangements by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at the convention. Any checks should be made payable to “Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Beginning this year all conventions will accept debit/credit card donations in addition to cash and checks. coming convention. Jehovah’s organization is preparing a program that has been specifically designed to address the current needs of the worldwide field.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Of course, we will get the most benefit if we are present and pay close attention all three days. If you have not already done so, talk to your employer about taking time off from work. Be sure to get sufficient rest each night so that you can be alert during the program. Many find that keeping their eyes focused on the speaker and taking brief notes helps them remain attentive. Do not allow your cell phone or pager to disturb you</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Accidents and Emergencies: </span><span class="font12">If a medical emergency arises at the convention site, please contact a nearby attendant, who will immediately notify First Aid so that our qualified first-aid personnel can assess the seriousness of the situation and render assistance. If it is necessary, our first-aid personnel will call 911. This will prevent emergency-response services from receiving many cell-phone calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Medication: </span><span class="font12">If you require prescription medication, please be sure to bring an adequate supply with you, since none will be available at the convention. Diabetic syringes and needles must be disposed of properly as hazardous waste and not in trash receptacles at convention venues and hotels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Footwear: </span><span class="font12">Each year a number of injuries occur that are related to footwear. It is best to (Deut. 31:12) How encouraging it is to see families sitting together during the convention and the young ones staying awake and paying close attention! Each evening, why not consult your notes and discuss together points from the program that you especially enjoyed? “Foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy,” so parents do well to supervise their children, including those in their teenage years, during the noon break and while at the hotel, rather than letting them be “on the loose.”—Prov. 22:15; 29:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Good Conduct Adorns the Truth: </span><span class="font12">Our good conduct while in the convention city adorns the truth. (Titus 2: 10) Hotel personnel take note when a group follows hotel rules and demonstrates patience and graciousness with the staff. (Col. 4:6) When branch office representatives were negotiating with a hotel last year, the sales director told them: “We love to have your people come to our hotel because of the kind of people they are. They are so well-mannered and kind, and they always treat our staff and facility with such respect.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">5. How will our good conduct while at the hotel adorn the truth?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">choose modest, well-fitting shoes that will allow you to walk safely on ramps, stairs, gratings, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Hearing Impaired: </span><span class="font12">The program will be broadcast in the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. To receive it, you will need to bring a small battery-operated FM receiver with earphones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Baby Strollers and Lawn Chairs: </span><span class="font12">Baby strollers and lawn chairs should not be brought to the convention site. However, child-safety seats are acceptable if they can be secured in a seat next to the parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Fragrances: </span><span class="font12">Most conventions take place in enclosed areas with mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be loving on our partto limit the use of strong fragrances, colognes, and</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> When we wear our convention badge, this not only serves to advertise the convention and enable other delegates to identify us but also gives a witness to onlookers. People in the convention city will observe that those wearing a convention badge are dressed neatly and modestly, not with the unkempt and provocative styles common in the world. (1 Tim. 2:9, 10) Therefore, we should give attention to our dress and grooming while in the convention city, including when we check in at the hotel. Arriving in shorts and a T-shirt would not reflect dignity. Even if the convention is at an open-air stadium, our clothing should be dignified. If we choose to change clothes after the program concludes and go to a restaurant, we should remember that we are still convention delegates and should not dress in an overly casual manner.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14">■ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Hotels:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(1) Please do not reserve more rooms than and the world, and this promoted unity. (Acts 2:1, 5) During district conventions our unique Christian brotherhood is on full display. This pleasant aspect of our spiritual paradise often impresses observers. (Ps. 133:1) Rather than leaving the facility during lunch to purchase food, how much better it is to bring a light lunch with us and take advantage of the opportunities to meet and converse with brothers and sisters sitting nearby!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Observers are often impressed by our well-organized and orderly conventions, especially when they learn that all the work is done by volunteers. Are you able to ‘offer yourself willingly’ to work at the convention? (Ps. 110:3) Entire families often volunteer to work as a way to train their children to give of themselves. If you are shy, working at the convention is a good way to meet other delegates. One sister remarked: “Except for my family and a handful of friends, I didn’t know many there. But when I helped with the cleaning, I met a lot of brothers and sisters. It was great fun!” Widening out our circle of friends</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">(2) Do not cancel your reservation except for an emergency situation, and notify the hotel as soon as it occurs.—Matt. 5:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">(3) Please note that if you use a debit or credit card when registering at a hotel, it is standard practice for them to place a “hold” on enough funds in your account to cover your total room cost plus any possible damages or incidentals during your stay. You will not be able to use any of those funds until your account is settled within a few days after you depart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">(4) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it, and return it immediately so that others may use it. by assisting at the convention will bring us much joy. (2 Cor. 6:12, 13) If you have never volunteered, ask the elders how you can qualify to assist.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Invite Others to Hear the Truth: </span><span class="font12">Three weeks before the start of our convention, we will, as in previous years, participate in a campaign to invite others to attend. Congregations will want to cover as much of their territory as possible with the invitation. (See the box “How Will We Offer the Invitation?”) Any leftover invitations should be brought to the convention. These will be used by delegates to witness informally while in the convention city.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> Do people respond to this annual campaign? At one convention, an attendant helped a married couple find a seat. They told him that they received the invitation and “thought it looked interesting.” They drove over 200 miles to attend! In another case, a sister going from house to house gave the invitation to a man who seemed curious about the convention. So she took time to discuss the invitation with him.

<p><span class="font12">(5) Tip hotel workers when they carry your luggage, and leave a tip for the housekeeper each day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">(6) Cook only in rooms where cooking is permitted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">(7) Do not abuse any complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice provisions that are made available for guests to consume while they are at the hotel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">(8) Display the fruitage of the spirit in dealing with the hotel staff. They are caring for a large number of guests and appreciate our kindness, patience, and reasonableness.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12">(9) Parents should supervise their children at all times around the hotel, including</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">In order to cover our territory, we may need to be brief. We might say something like this: “Hello. We are sharing in a global effort to distribute this invitation. Here is your copy. You will find more details on the invitation.” Be enthusiastic. When sharing in the distribution on the weekends, you should also offer the magazines when appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> The seasonal festivals were a loving provision from Jehovah to help the Israelites “serve him in faultlessness and in truth.” (Josh. 24:14) Similarly, our attendance at our yearly district conventions helps us to “go on walking in the truth” and is a vital part of our worship. (3 John 3) May Jehovah bless the efforts of all lovers of truth to attend and benefit to the full!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">11. Why is attendance at our annual district conventions important?</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">(11) If a problem arises with your hotel room, inform the Rooming Department while at the convention so they can assist you.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Two Coins of Little Value</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">One important way that we support Kingdom interests is by contributing financially to the worldwide preaching work. What if we are of limited means?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On one occasion Jesus saw a poor widow contribute to the temple treasury two coins of little monetary value. Love for Jehovah moved her to give “out of her want, ...allof what she had, her whole living.” (Mark 12:4144) Jesus took note, indicating that her contribution had great value in God’s eyes. Similarly, first-centur y Christians did not view the responsibility of providing financial support for the ministry to be the privilege of only wealthy Christians. The apostle Paul cited the example of the Macedonians who, despite “deep poverty . . . kept begging . . . with much entreaty for the privilege of kindly giv-ing.”—2 Cor. 8:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Therefore, if we can only contribute ‘two coins of little value,’ we should remember that many small contributions can add up to a large amount. Our giving from the heart will please our generous heavenly Father, for “God loves a cheerful giver.”—2 Cor. 9:7.</span></p>

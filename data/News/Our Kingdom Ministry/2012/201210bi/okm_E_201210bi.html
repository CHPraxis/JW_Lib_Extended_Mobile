<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Could You Share in Evening Witnessing?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> According to the book Daily Life in Bible Times, the apostle Paul typically shared in the house-to-house ministry “from 4 p.m. till far into the night.” We do not know whether this was Paul’s actual schedule, but we do </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">know</span><span class="font11"> that Paul was willing to “do all things</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. According to one scholar, when did the apostle Paul preach from house to house? for the sake of the good news.” (1 Cor. 9:1923) This would have included arranging his affairs to go from house to house when it was most productive to do so.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Publishers in many places have traditionally gone from house to house in the mornings during the week. However, in your area, is this still the best time? One pioneer relates regarding his territory: “Hardly anyone is at home during the day. But most people are home in the evening.” Evening witnessing may provide the best opportunity to reach men, in particular, with the good news. Householders are often more relaxed and willing to converse. If it is beneficial to do so, elders should arrange meetings for service in the evening.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Use Discernment: When sharing in evening witnessing, discernment is important. For example, if you happen to call on someone at an inopportune time, such as during his dinner, it is best to offer to come back later. If it is dark, stand where the householder can see you, and quickly identify yourself and the purpose of your visit. It is also wise to work in pairs or in groups and to stay on well-lit streets where you are not isolated. Do not call so late that you disturb householders preparing to retire for the night. (2 Cor. 6:3) If a neighborhood is unsafe after dark, preach there during the early evening.—Prov. 22:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Blessings: The ministry is far more enjoyable when we are able to give a witness. And the more we are able to witness, the more opportunities we will have to help others to “be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) Could you adjust your schedule to share in evening </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">witne</span><span class="font11">ssing?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Bible tracts have long been used by Jehovah’s people to spread the good news. In 1880, C. T. Russell and his associates began to produce </span><span class="font11">Bible Students’ Tracts, </span><span class="font12">and these were provided to readers of the </span><span class="font11">Watch Tower </span><span class="font12">for distribution to the public. Tracts </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">were</span><span class="font12"> considered so important that in 1884</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. How have tracts been used by God’s people?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">when C. T. Russell registered a non-profit legal corporation for the purpose of furthering Kingdom interests, the word “tract” was included in the name, Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society, now called the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. By 1918, more than 300 million tracts had been distributed by the Bible Students. Tracts continue to be an effective witnessing tool.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Why Effective: </span><span class="font12">Tracts are colorful and eye-catching. The concise message they contain is absorbing and informative. They are appealing to householders who may be intimidated by a magazine or a book. Tracts are easy to offer, even by new publishers and children. In addition, tracts are a handy size and easy for us to carry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Many first come in contact with the truth by means of a tract. For example, a woman in Haiti noticed one of our tracts on the street. She picked it up, read it, and exclaimed, “I have found the truth!” Eventually, she went to the Kingdom Hall, began studying the Bible, and was baptized—all because of the power of God’s Word found in a tract.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> From House to House: </span><span class="font12">Since tracts are an effective tool for giving a witness, they will be the offer for the month from time to time, beginning in November.

<p><span class="font12">tracts to start conversations. If there is interest on the initial call or on the return visit, we can demonstrate a Bible study by using the </span><span class="font11">Bible Teach </span><span class="font12">book or another study publication. How might we offer tracts from house to house? Each tract is different, so we need to be familiar with those we are offering.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Our presentation should be tailored to the territory and the tract we are using. We could start the conversation by handing the tract to the householder. The attractive cover may well arouse his interest. Or we could show several tracts and allow the householder to choose what interests him. When working territory where people hesitate to open their door, we could hold the tract where the householder can see the cover, or we might ask to slide something under the door that we would like to get his opinion on. If the title of the tract is a question, we could then ask him to express his opinion on it. Or we can formulate our own question that will arouse</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">interest and stimulate conversation. We could then read a portion of the tract’s contents with the householder, pausing at the questions in the text and inviting the householder to express himself. Key scriptures can be read from the Bible. After considering some of the material, we can conclude the discussion and make definite arrangements to return. If the congregation normally leaves literature at not-at-homes, we may leave a tract out of sight if the householder is not home.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Street Witnessing: </span><span class="font12">Have you used tracts in street witnessing? Some passersby are in a hurry and not inclined to stop</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">to converse with us. It may be difficult to determine their level of interest. Instead of handing them the latest magazines without knowing whether they will read them, why not give them a tract instead? Because the cover is appealing and the message is brief, curiosity may move people to read the tract when they have a few minutes. Of course, if they are not in a hurry, we can discuss some of the contents of the tract with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Informal Witnessing: </span><span class="font12">It is easy to witness informally with tracts. One brother puts a few in his pocket whenever he leaves home. When he meets someone, such as a store clerk, he simply offers to give him something to read and hands him a tract. When one couple went to New York City to do some sightseeing, they realized that they would come in contact with people from various countries. So they took along the </span><span class="font11">Nations </span><span class="font12">booklet and several tracts in different languages. Then, when they heard someone speaking in a foreign language who was selling items on the sidewalk or who was sitting near them in the park or in a restaurant, they would offer him a tract in his native tongue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Sow Your Seed”: </span><span class="font12">Tracts can be likened to seed. A farmer scatters his seed liberally because he does not know which ones will germinate and sprout. Ecclesiastes 11:6 says: “In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest; for you are not knowing where this will have success, either here or there, or whether both of them will alike be good.” Therefore, may we “keep scattering knowledge” by means of this very effective witnessing tool.—Prov. 15:7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">7. Relate experiences showing how to use tracts when witnessing informally.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11">8. In what way are tracts like seed?</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark22"></a>How to Benefit From Your Field Service Group</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Do you miss certain aspects of the Congregation Book Study? Groups were small and the setting more relaxed. This made it easy to develop friendships that were a source of spiritual support. (Prov. 18: 24) The book study overseer got to know our unique circumstances and could provide personal encouragement. (Prov. 27:23; 1 Pet. 5:2, 3) These benefits are still avail</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">able </span><span class="font12">through our field service group.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">1. What benefits of the Congregation Book Study arrangement are still available through our field service group?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Take the Initiative: </span><span class="font12">Field service groups are generally the same size that book study groups were. By working in the ministry “side by side” with others, a close bond can result. (Phil. 1:27) How many in your group have you worked with? Could you “widen out” in this regard? (2 Cor. 6: 13) Additionally, we might occasionally invite someone from our group to join us for our Family Worship evening or for a meal. In some congregations, field service groups take turns providing hospitality to the visiting speaker. On their assigned week, the group gathers for a meal and mutual encouragement regardless of whether the speaker can attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Although the congregation now meets together on one less occasion a week, this does not mean that publishers should receive less shepherding. Group overseers are appointed in each group to give individuals personal encouragement and training for the ministry. If your group overseer has not yet made an appointment to work with you in the ministry, why not ask to work with him? In addition, the service overseer shares in the ministry with a different group one weekend each month. In smaller congregations where there are only a few field service groups, he may arrange to visit each group twice during the year. Do you arrange your schedule to go in the ministry when he serves your group?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> It is often advantageous for each group to meet separately for field service on weekends. Having several locations to meet for service at approximately the same time may make it easier for publishers to travel to the meeting for service and perhaps </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">to th</span><span class="font12">e territory. Publishers can be orga-</span></p></li></ul>

It is also easier for the group overseer to give close attention to those in his care. However, circumstances may make it advisable for two or more groups to combine. If the entire congregation meets together for service on the first Saturday of the month or after the </span><span class="font11">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">Study, it is often beneficial for each group to sit together and the group overseer to be given a few minutes to organize his group before the meeting for field service is concluded with prayer.—See the box “Can You Offer Your Home?”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Although the Congregation Book Study arrangement has ended, Jehovah continues to provide everything we need to do his will. (Heb. 13:20, 21) Under Jehovah’s care, we lack nothing. (Ps. 23:1) Many blessings are available through our field service group. If we take the initiative and ‘sow bountifully,’ we will “reap bountifully.” —2 Cor. 9:6.</span></p></li></ul>

<h6><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Can You Offer Your Home?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font6">Some congregations combine groups for service on the weekend because there is a shortage of homes in which to meet. Meetings for field service are an extension of the congregation arrangement, so hosting these is a real privilege. Could you make your home available? Do not hold back because your home is humble. The elders will take into account the location of your home and other factors similar to those considered when they selected locations for the book study. If you would like to offer your home, let your group overseer know.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Five Ways to Find a Bible Study</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Have you found it a challenge to find someone with whom to study the Bible? Keep trying. Jehovah blesses those who do not give up in doing his will. (Gal. 6:9) Below are five suggestions to help you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font11"> Direct Approach: </span><span class="font12">Many people know that we offer </span><span class="font11">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">and </span><span class="font11">Awake!, </span><span class="font12">but they may not know that we offer Bible studies. Why not try the direct approach when going from house to house? You could also ask interested people whom you call on whether they would like a Bible study. If they decline, you can continue leaving literature and cultivating the interest. One brother had been calling on a married couple for years as part of his magazine route. After leaving them the latest magazines, he turned around to leave but as an afterthought asked: “Would you like a Bible study?” To his surprise they answered yes. Now they are baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font11"> Meeting Attenders: </span><span class="font12">Do not assume that interested ones you see at congregation meetings already have a Bible study. One brother reports: “More than half of the studies I’ve had were started by speaking to those who attended meetings.” One sister decided to approach a shy woman whose baptized daughters were in the congregation. The woman had been attending meetings for about 15 years and always came into the Kingdom Hall just as the meeting began and left as soon as it was finished. The woman agreed to a study and eventually came into the truth. The sister writes: “I’m just sorry that I waited 15 years to ask her if she would like to study!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11"> Referrals: </span><span class="font12">One sister endeavors to ac-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. If it is a challenge to find a Bible study in our territory, what should we do, and why?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. How can we use the direct approach to start a study?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. Should we assume that meeting attenders are studying the Bible with someone? Explain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">4. How could we find a study by means of referrals?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">company others on their Bible studies. With the teacher’s permission, at the conclusion she asks the student if she knows any others who might enjoy having their own study. When offering the </span><span class="font11">Bible Teach </span><span class="font12">book to someone you have been calling on, you might ask: “Do you know anyone else who would enjoy a copy?” At times, circumstances do not allow publishers and pioneers to conduct a study with someone they meet in the territory. So let others know that you are available to conduct a Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font11"> Unbelieving Mates: </span><span class="font12">Are there publishers in your congregation who are married to unbelievers? Some unbelievers resist talking about the Bible with their Christian mate but would accept an invitation to study with someone outside the family. It is often best to consult with the believing husband or wife beforehand in order to determine the best approach.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font11"> Prayer: </span><span class="font12">Do not underestimate the power of prayer. (Jas. 5:16) Jehovah promises to listen to our requests when they are in harmony with his will. (1 John 5:14) One brother who had a very busy schedule began praying for a Bible study. His wife wondered if he would have the time to care for a student, especially if the student had many problems. So she made these concerns known to Jehovah when praying for her husband to find a study. Their prayers were answered about two weeks later when a pioneer in the congregation found a man who wanted to study and turned the study over to the brother. The wife writes: “To any who may feel that conducting a Bible study would be more than they can handle, I say: Be specific in your prayers, and don’t stop praying about it. We have had more joy than I could have imagined.” With perseverance, you too may be able to find a Bible study and experience the joy of helping someone onto “the road </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">leadi</span><span class="font12">ng off into life.”—Matt. 7:13, 14.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">5. Why might we ask unbelieving mates of congregation members if they would like to study? 6. How valuable is prayer when trying to find a study?</span></p></li></ul>

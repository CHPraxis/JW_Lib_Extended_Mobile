</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> Since the year 1939 the words “Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom” have appeared on the cover of every issue of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font16"> and how appropriate this is! People everywhere need to know about God’s Kingdom. Why? Because the Kingdom is the solution to all the problems that distress mankind and because the very lives of people are at stake. It has been by reading the Bible along with this magazine that people by the thousands in all parts of the earth have come to know and love Jehovah, and they are enthusiastically joining the growing number of loyal supporters of his Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> It is appropriate, then, that we begin the 1986 calendar year with the 48th annual </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> subscription campaign. While emphasis should be placed on </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font16"> excellent results may come from Offering the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font16"> subscription too.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">USING </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">THE WATCHTOWER </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TO HELP OTHERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> We will want to take advantage of every opportunity to offer subscriptions. A few ways in which this can be done are from house to house; on return visits; in street</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Prepare Magazine Presentations</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> If you wanted to show someone how to cope with today’s problems, what would be your source material? If you wanted to give the real meaning behind current events, yet remain politically neutral and not exalt one race above another, where could you turn? If you wanted to help someone keep watch on world events as they fulfill Bible prophecy, what information could you confidently refer to? If you wanted to offer something that encourages faith in the now-reigning King, Jesus Christ, and exalts Jehovah God as the Sovereign of the universe, what is the best printed material available? The answer to all these questions is </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font16">and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Truly, we have in these two magazines the reading material needed by mankind today. Are we offering these magazines with conviction, enthusiasm, and zeal? Are we well prepared so as to make time count? Could we improve our presentations?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ADVANCE PREPARATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> One of the best ways to become immediately familiar with what is in each issue of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font16">and business witnessing; to neighbors, fellow workers, or schoolmates; and as gifts to relatives. No doubt you can think of other ways to offer subscriptions. Helpful suggestions were given in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font16"> for April 1983.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> The opening articles in the January issues should stimulate us to make an enthusiastic presentation of the magazines. For example, the January 1 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> cover title is “The Horsemen of the Apocalypse —The Mystery Solved” and for January 15, “The Horsemen of the Apocalypse—How Their Ride Affects You.” The February 1 and 15 issues will feature a continuation of this theme with the cover titles “The Beasts of the Apocalypse —What Do They Mean?” and “The Apocalypse—When?” What a powerful aid these magazines will be in helping people to learn about Jehovah’s Kingdom!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> In order to impart something meaningful, advance preparation is essential. Become well acquainted with the material you are going to feature. Highlight specific points.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> Be ready also to describe the purpose and contents of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-(Continued on page 7, col. 2) and Awake!</span><span class="font16"> is to read what appears on page 2 in the sections “In This Issue” and “Feature Articles.” Many publishers get ideas on what to feature just from reading over this brief material. But this is only a beginning.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> Next, look through the pages of each issue and read over the article titles and subheadings. Then pause and reflect on who in the territory might be interested in these subjects. Thereafter, read through the magazine, article by article, making note of interesting talking points. Occasionally, important points are highlighted in italics or bold type right in the articles themselves. Refer to these when showing the magazines to individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> As you read through each magazine, determine which articles would fit various types of people in the territory. Certain articles are especially suited to a particular segment of the population. Articles have appeared concerning single parents, abortion, nuclear warfare, child abuse, and accidents, plus a host of other specific topics. So, as we read the variety of articles pub-</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col.</span><span class="font16"> 3)</span></p>

Then state: “While world problems seem to perplex many, did you know that long ago God revealed what will shortly take place in our day? What he said in the Bible book of Revelation reveals much about our future.” Read Revelation 1:1 and then refer to a particular point in the cover article of the January 1 or January 15, 1986, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> that shows how the prophecy is being fulfilled today. Continue by saying: “Even though distressing conditions exist today, note the happy future God has promised. [Read Revelation 21:3, 4.] This issue of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> discusses in greater detail what the Bible foretold about the future. You can receive 24 issues of this magazine in one year for $4.00.” Conclude this part by encouraging participation in offering </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> subscription on first Sunday in January.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1986 District Convention Arrangements</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Divine education promotes peace. This was emphasized by the inspired words of the prophet Isaiah regarding sons of God’s symbolic woman, or heavenly organization, when he stated: “And all your sons will be persons taught by Jehovah, and the peace of your sons will be abundant.” (Isa. 54:13) That statement certainly shows a direct relationship between divine education and peace. Furthermore, the apostle Paul in his letter to the Philippians stated: “The peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:7) Since this “peace of God” is granted to and enjoyed only by those who willingly receive and apply such divine education, we are confident that you will be anxious to be in attendance at one of the forthcoming 1986 “Divine Peace” District Conventions that are being scheduled in the contiguous United States. A complete list will be in the February 1, 1986, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower. </span><span class="font2">There is no question that this will require real effort on your part. The apostle Peter in his first letter to the early Christians wrote that they should “seek peace and pursue it.” (1 Pet. 3:11) The rewards should prove to be well worth the effort we may expend to be in attendance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> During the announcement period of the Service Meeting for the week of December 29, the letter from the Society dated December 10,1985, should be read, informing the congregation of the convention it is assigned to attend. Following this Service Meeting, the elders should post on the congregation’s information board the Recommended Lodging Locations list that has been received from the district convention committee of all the motels that are cooperating with the Society’s rooming arrangement. By cooperating with these arrangements, the congregations will help the convention organization in its efforts to provide sufficient seats, food, literature, and rooming accommodations for everyone. To assist you in making the necessary arrangements, the information that follows is being provided. As you make your plans to be in attendance, lovingly include others who need assistance, especially newly interested ones, so that they too can attend every session. (Gal. 6:10) The program will start at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING ARRANGEMENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> You should make your own rooming arrangements directly with the motel by using the information provided by the convention through your congregation. In most cases you will pay a great deal less than the regular rates charged by the motel, since the local convention committee has negotiated for a large number of good quality rooms. These rooms will be assigned by the motel only to those identifying themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses or as delegates attending the Watchtower Convention. The Recommended Lodging Locations list shows the address of the facility, its agreed-upon rates, and the phone number to be used in making your reservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: </span><span class="font2">As soon as your congregation posts the list of motels, you should IMMEDIATELY phone the motel of your choice, identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower Convention. Doing so will qualify you for the agreed-upon rates listed. Do not make rooming reservations at more than one facility or reservations that you do not intend to use. (Matt. 5:37) MOTELS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO EXTEND THE SPECIAL RATES BEYOND THE CUTOFF DATE. If you find it necessary to cancel your accommodations, you should write or phone the motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. This makes the room available for other delegates who need accommodations. If the motel you call first is filled, then call your next selection from the list, and so on. The convention Rooming Department will monitor the arrangement and, through the congregation, will provide revised lists as long as necessary, deleting those motels that are filled and adding additional ones until everyone has a room. Thus, if the motels on the list are filled when you call, please wait patiently for the next list and you will be able to obtain a room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> DORMITORIES: </span><span class="font2">A few conventions use school dormitories in order to accommodate all those attending. Usually congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first motel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow through in accord with the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention committee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> SPECIAL NEEDS: </span><span class="font2">Arrangements to care for those with special needs should be made by the congregation where these attend. Elders and others aware of such circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often involves taking others with them in their own group, for example, those in full-time service, the elderly, the infirm, or the deaf. They may also care for such ones in other ways. (Acts 20:35; Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3:17,18) We are confident that loving concern will be shown to all who need our help. (2 Cor. 6:11-13; John 13:35; Gal. 6:10) Of course, the convention Rooming Department will endeavor to provide rooming accommodations for those with special needs who are unable to care for themselves, or who cannot be cared for or assisted by those from their local congregation. These may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for a Special Needs Room Request form, discussing their situation with him at that time. Those with special needs are the only ones that should use this form. They should fill it out and return it to the convention coordinator to be checked for completeness, accuracy, and verification of the fact that their circumstances qualify them for special needs consideration that cannot be cared for by the local congregation. This should be done well ahead of the convention. Even though the convention coordinator forwards the form for the publisher with special needs to the convention Rooming Department, the individual will be notified directly of the accommodations by the Rooming Department. The publisher with special needs should NOT simply go to the convention and request a room when he arrives, because the convention Rooming Department needs the verification of the congregation’s convention coordinator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Private home accommodations listed by the convention are usually set aside for those who have limited funds and who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money. Nor is it proper for delegates to presume upon the hospitality of our brothers by expecting to be accommodated extra days so that they can visit vacation spots or do other things before or after the convention. These rooms are for the convention period only.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> DELEGATES ATTENDING FROM OUTSIDE THE ASSIGNED AREA: </span><span class="font2">To reduce travel, district conventions are arranged at many locations. In nearly every case, the location assigned for you to attend is the one nearest to your congregation. Seating, literature, food orders, and so forth, are planned on the premise that the majority will attend the convention to which they are assigned. However, if for some reason you will be attending a location other than the one assigned, you may ask the convention coordinator in your congregation for the address of the convention headquarters where you will attend. He will find these addresses listed on the back of the Special Needs Room Request form. Unless persons have special needs, they should NOT use the Special Needs Room Request form. Rather, they should write to the convention headquarters where they wish to attend and request a copy of the motel listing for that location, sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope along with this request. Upon receipt of this listing of motels, they should proceed just as if they were using the list for their local area.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> YOUR COOPERATION NEEDED: </span><span class="font2">The smoothness and the success with which this rooming arrangement functions depends largely on the cooperation of everyone involved. For instance, if a number of delegates run ahead and make reservations on their own before the congregation receives the list of facilities that are cooperating with the convention Rooming Department, it can cause a major breakdown in negotiations. This would also include making reservations for the following year while attending the current convention as some have done, even though they do not know the dates or if a convention will even be scheduled in that city. If this is done and a convention is scheduled in that city the following year, the motel management would see no need to list with the convention nor give them special rates, since most of the rooms would already be filled with our people during that time. The same is true if a number of delegates choose to make their own arrangements with facilities the convention did not list because they did not cooperate with the convention rooming arrangement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> In the past some have not seen fit, for one reason or another, to select their rooming accommodations from motels on the Recommended Lodging Locations list provided through the Society’s arrangement. When this happens, it has been known to jeopardize seriously the possibility of using that city again for a convention, because other motels have learned of those that did not cooperate with us and yet these motels were filled with our people at much higher rates than we were willing to list. One such motel manager stated: “WHY SHOULD I LIST ROOMS WITH YOUR CONVENTION AT LOWER RATES? I FILL THEM ANYWAY WITH YOUR PEOPLE!” Managers who cooperated with us on rates and whose motels were listed have felt taken advantage of, since other motels did not cooperate and yet they were filled at much higher rates. As a result, they have stated that for future conventions they will raise their rates too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> As an example, a motel across the street from the convention site or elsewhere may not lower its rates or may possibly even raise them for the convention, as has been the case in some instances. Hence, the convention Rooming Department advises the motel management that the motel will not be put on the list and thus get our business. However, if brothers go ahead and accept these higher rates and fill this motel, even though it is not listed, then that motel may never lower its rates. In turn, the management of other motels may be encouraged to hold out for higher prices.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>12</sup> We have been informed, also, of another practice on the part of some that is seriously damaging our relationship with the motels as well as depriving other brothers and sisters of needed rooming accommodations. Some have been making reservations at a number of motels and when they arrive in the convention city, they check each one. The one that suits them best is the one they take. This results in a considerable number of rooms remaining empty and perhaps prevents some of our brothers and sisters from enjoying the accommodations they prefer. It also causes the motel to lose money, since there is no demand at this point for the room unless someone happens to come at the last minute.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>13</sup> In this regard, a letter was recently received from the general manager of a very prominent motel who had this to say: ‘We have deeply appreciated having Jehovah’s Witnesses stay here. However, there has been a trend developing, in the last years, on the part of those attending to make a reservation for a room early in the year, with no real intention of using that room. This year, our reservation department had to refuse some of your people’s requests for accommodations, only to find there were many rooms unclaimed throughout your convention. Some, by their own admission, had reserved rooms at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">three</span><span class="font2"> motels, intending to see, on arrival, which one they liked best. This is certainly an unfair practice for both the motels and for those persons who had wished to come but had been informed that there were no rooms available.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>14</sup> The conventions are working to save all our brothers as much expense as possible, and so it is in the best interests of all that everyone cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement. The listing is broad enough to give a choice of good quality accommodations and yet give preference to the motels that cooperate. Our aim with this rooming arrangement is to help delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible, so that they will be refreshed and fully able to enjoy the fine spiritual program.</span></p></li></ul>

(No provision will be made at any other conventions for sign language.)

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> Do you find that your opening words at the door are often the most difficult part of presenting the good news? Yet how eager we are to have people listen to the Bible’s lifesaving message! (John 17:3; 1 Tim. 4:16) To accomplish this, we need to develop introductions that will arouse interest in our new Topic for Conversation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> As announced in the October issue of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font16"> circuit overseers have been reviewing points from the new book </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures</span><span class="font16"> at meetings for field service during their visits with the congregations. On Wednesday and Thursday mornings they have been considering introductions that would be appropriate in the local territory. Pages 9-15 of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font16">book set out about 40 different introductions that could relate to ■various topics for discussion. Are you using this valuable information?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> You may find it easy to use the third introduction on page 10 under “BIBLE/GOD.” You might sim</span></p></li></ul>

Interest may be shown in such things as the number of languages in which </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> is published, how many copies of each issue are printed, the number of lands in which it is distributed, and the fact that it is read by people of all religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">POINTS TO REMEMBER</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>7</sup> The real purpose behind our work is to give a witness and cultivate interest in God’s Word. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> is a valuable aid for helping people to understand and respect the Bible.

<p><span class="font14">—Italian, Spanish </span><span class="font16">ply say: “I’m glad to find you at home. I’m sharing with my neighbors an encouraging thought from the Bible. Have you ever wondered what the future holds for you?” After listening to the householder’s response, it is quite natural to proceed to discuss Revelation 1:1 and Revelation 21:3, 4. If you find it best not to mention the Bible so early in your presentation, you may wish to try using the first suggestion under “FUTURE/ SECURITY” on page 11, tailoring it to lead into the two scriptures from Revelation. A review of the other suggested introductions may give you additional ideas that will work well in your territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> By making good use of this feature in our </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font16"> book, those important introductory words will not be so difficult to find. This should lead to more conversations in which we can highlight the Kingdom theme of our ministry. May we all show genuine concern for the future of others by using appealing introductions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Love for the Worldwide Brotherhood</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.” (John 13:34) Love for one another proved to be absolutely necessary for those disciples of Christ Jesus in the first century. In this 20th century it is just as necessary that such love be shown. How appropriate, then, that the theme chosen for the circuit assemblies to begin in February 1986 should be “Love for the Worldwide Brotherhood.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> The program is designed to consider many aspects of this love that is so necessary as a bonding agent, holding God’s people together in unity and integrity. While Satan’s world continues to manifest hatred among nations, peoples, languages, and cultures, Jehovah’s people manifest love for the worldwide household of faith. The circuit assembly program has been designed to encourage the showing of love not only to those related to us in the faith but also to those we can help to learn the truth and come into association with us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> Our aim is that Jehovah should find us in an approved condition as a united brotherhood worldwide. (2 Pet. 3:13, 14) Let us all make plans now to be present both days.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Following Up on Expiring Subscription Slips</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> Calling on people whose </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font16"> subscriptions are soon to expire provides an excellent opportunity to give a further witness. The groundwork has already been laid, and the householder has been receiving one or both of the magazines regularly for some time. Although some will not have read everything in each issue, they have had spiritual food coming into their home on a regular basis to remind them about Jehovah and his Kingdom blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> Expiring Subscription slips should be given to the one who obtained the original subscription. But because of publishers moving or subscriptions being sent in by someone from another congregation, you may have opportunity to follow up on an Expiring Subscription slip. What view should we take toward making one of these return visits?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PROPER VIEW</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> We should go with a positive attitude toward giving a further witness and, of course, encouraging the person to resubscribe. Maybe the householder was not ready to study when he originally subscribed, but now, after receiving the magazine for a year, his viewpoint may have changed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">* What can be done to give subscribers the best possible service and to help the Society process subscription renewals promptly? Some points for consideration are: (1) Those handling subscriptions should be prompt in getting the Expiring Subscription slips into the hands of the brothers so that a return visit can be made to renew the subscription. (2) Publishers should have the slip with them when making the return visit and use it if the person resubscribes, rather than using a blank subscription slip. This makes it unnecessary to return the address portion of the magazine wrapper. (3) All subscriptions should be turned in at the very next meeting if at all possible. In turn, these should be mailed to the Society EACH WEEK even if there is only one to be sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT COULD YOU SAY?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> When calling on someone whose subscription is about to expire, what could we say that would stimulate interest in reading the magazine? Would a direct approach be best, just advising the person that the subscription is to run out soon and inviting him to renew it? This may bring results in some cases. However, it is often found that the subscriber’s interest has waned if someone has not been calling on him regularly. So it may be necessary to revive the initial interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> After introducing yourself, you might say: “I am making a special effort to visit people in the community who have been receiving </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> (or </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!)</span><span class="font16"> through the mail this past year. I hope you have been enjoying it as much as I have.” A brief pause at this point would give the householder an opportunity to comment on whether he has been able to read many of the articles. You could then go on to say: “Here in the current issue is an article I especially enjoyed. [Give subject or title of article. A few additional comments about the article may be appropriate.] We have just received a notice that your subscription will soon be expiring (or has expired) and we do not want you to miss a single issue. I would be happy to send in the renewal for you. The cost is just S4.00 for the entire year.” The householder may choose not to renew at that time, but if you discern there is still some interest, arrangements could be made to call again.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>7</sup> Remember that our purpose is to teach people the truth and to share in the vindication of Jehovah’s great and holy name. Aside from </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font16"> there are no magazines on the face of the earth that serve the divine purpose. What a blessing comes to the household receiving and regularly reading these magazines! Let us do our part by making good use of the Expiring Subscription slips.</span></p></li></ul>

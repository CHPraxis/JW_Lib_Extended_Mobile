<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Eccl. 8:9—Man’s rule burdensome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Mic. 4:3, 4—Jehovah’s government brings blessings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Peace and Security—A Reliable Hope</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Most people today desire peace and security. But real peace, along with security, has been elusive for this world. Millions live in areas that have been devastated by war. Countless others feel that finding peace and security is hopeless because of terrorist activity or guerrilla warfare. Many fear leaving their heavily secured homes after dark when criminal elements seem to take over. Few indeed are those whose lives are tranquil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Last April when we offered the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security —How Can You Find Itf,</span><span class="font12"> over one million books were placed in the United States. As Christians we heed the command of Jesus: “Wherever you enter into a house say first, ‘May this house have peace.’ And if a friend of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if there is not, it will turn back to you.” (Luke 10:5, 6) As representatives of the God of peace, we approach people peacefully.—Eph. 6:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EXAMPLES AS PEACE SEEKERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Obviously, Jehovah’s people must live peacefully in their communities and congregations in order to recommend a peaceful message. We must be examples of peaceseeking people. Peter wrote fellow</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Your Utmost by Sharing in Full-Time Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “The greater the effort, the greater the blessings,” said the convention speaker. He then asked those in the pioneer section at the “Divine Peace&quot; District Convention to raise their hands if they agreed. Do you remember the response? Next, the speaker enumerated some of the blessings that one receives by persevering in full-time service—increased spirituality, skill in using the Bible, privileges of service in God’s organization, living letters of recommendation, and an improved personality, to mention a few.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The most important blessing one can strive for is God’s approval. It is worth doing your utmost to attain, said one full-time minister, the apostle Paul. He spurred Timothy on with the words: “Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God.” He also encouraged Timothy to obtain that approval by being “a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">workman</span><span class="font12"> with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.” (2 Tim. 2:15) We, Christians to “be found finally by him spotless and unblemished and in peace.” (2 Pet. 3:14) How do we become examples as peace-seeking Christians?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> First, we maintain peaceful relations with Jehovah, the God of peace. We recognize his authority as Supreme Sovereign, and we are obedient to his commands. (Ps. 34: 14) Peace, a fruit of his spirit, must be evident in our lives.—Gal. 5:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Our example as peace-seeking Christians must also include respect for human authorities. This would include governmental authorities, schoolteachers, employers, parents, and elders. (Rom. 13: 1, 2; Col. 3:22; Eph. 6:1; Heb. 13: 17) By leading quiet and peaceful lives we adorn our message. We demonstrate that we want to “pursue the things making for peace and the things that are upbuilding to one another.”—Rom. 14:19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CURRENT OFFER PROMOTES PEACE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> During November we will share our hope by offering the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security—How Can You Find Itf</span><span class="font12"> along with the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </span><span class="font12">for a contribution of $4.50.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FULFILL YOUR DEDICATION IN FULL-TIME SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Pioneering can be a most satisfying way to fulfill one’s dedication to Jehovah. To be successful, pioneers must put spiritual things first in their lives. Their minds should not be loaded down with anxieties over material things to the point that they lose their efficiency. They learn to let Jehovah bear their burdens by casting all their anxieties on him. (1 Pet. 5:6, 7) One sister, after ten years of pioneering, said: “Jehovah is the one who knows my problems and can solve them. Can I serve anyone better than him?”</span></p></li>
<li>

<p><span class="font12">peace and security are on the minds of millions of people in this troubled world today, this offer is most timely.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> The first two chapters of the book contain excellent talking points. You may wish to read to the householder the first two paragraphs on page 5. Or you could refer to paragraph 11 on page 8, where God’s sure promises are contrasted with what human leaders promise. See also paragraphs 28 and 29 on pages 20-1. Be sure to call back on all who show interest or take the offer, endeavoring to start a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Let us continue telling those who seek peace and security of the truly reliable hope guaranteed by Jehovah, the God of peace, teaching them how it will be accomplished through his Kingdom in the hands of Jesus, the Prince of Peace. (Isa. 9:6, 7) May our example of peaceful living continue to recommend us as Christians who “seek peace and pursue it.”—1 Pet. 3:10, 11.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">service? He quoted Jesus, who said: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself ... and continually follow me.” (Matt. 16:24) The apostle Paul prayed that the love of his fellow Christians might abound more and more, with a view to their being filled with righteous fruit. (Phil. 1:9-11) In your case, could this mean entering pioneer service? One sister in her 80’s, after half a century of full-time service, said concerning pioneering: “What if Jesus Christ would ask you himself?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Have you thought about how pioneering can help you fulfill your dedication? If you can make room for it, the benefits Eire many. One young pioneer sister from the Netherlands said after just one year of pioneering: ‘When you are busy serving Jehovah every day, you become more and more conscious of his purpose. Your personal relationship with him improves also because you study more and pray more intensely. You get to know Jehovah better as a Person.’ Would you like to get to know Jehovah better as a Person?—John 17:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ELDERS TO HELP PIONEERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> If a pioneer has some difficulty in meeting the hour requirement for the month, he should note the reason on the back of the Field Service Report form (S-4) now used. To give appropriate help, direction, and counsel, the elders should become familiar with the information published in the insert of the February 1978 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> During December the elders should arrange for a meeting of all the regular pioneers to discuss information provided by the Society especially for that meeting. It is recommended that this meeting be conducted by the presiding overseer and the service overseer. The meeting should be spiritual, practical, and encouraging—designed to meet the needs of the local pioneers. It should help them to continue doing their utmost in the full-time service.</span></p>

All of those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities.

Questions as to the young Christian's responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul was equipped to reason by using godly knowledge. Acts 17:17 says that “he began to reason in the synagogue with the Jews . . . and every day in the marketplace with those who happened to be on hand.” To the Corinthians he wrote that their spiritual weapons were “powerful by God,” enabling Christians to ‘overturn reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God.’—2 Cor. 10:4, 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> We, too, are equipped with powerful information, enabling us </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font12">reason with whomever we happwi to meet in our ministry. Like Paul, we meet people with many religious persuasions, philosophies, ideologies, and human theories. Paul invited them to reason, and we can do the same.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Our </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book helps us to have confidence in speaking with people. It contains the facts that are necessary to help individuals reach proper conclusions and make sound decisions. Thus, we can courageously speak with individuals regardless of their education or background. For example, if a controversial subject such as hellfire or neutrality comes up, we can simply say: “Recently I read something on that subject, and I would like to share it with you.” Then we can bring out our </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book and carry on a conversation based on the contents. With the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book we can feel relaxed about discussing nearly any subject a person may bring up. Always having our </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book with us in field service, ready for use, will help us to be “equipped for every good work.”—2 Tim. 3:17.</span></p></li></ul>

To do this effectively, we need to put people at ease so they will listen to the Kingdom message. Our ability to converse in a natural manner with a sincere desire to help others learn the truth can make us successful in our ministry. Being familiar with the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book can help us achieve these goals.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Jesus recognized and responded to the desperate spiritual needs of the people. We need to be motivated in the same way. Because of personal pursuit of material things and the exclusion of spiritual interests, men have become wayward in their thinking, resulting in mental, emotional, and physical breakdown. (1 Tim. 6:9) We can provide the help that is needed by using our </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book, which assists us to converse on many major topics of life, such as marriage and family problems, abortion, drugs, and other difficulties people may face. For instance, one sister used the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book on a return visit to discuss the subject of marriage, since the young couple she was calling on were living together without being married. On her next visit a Bible study was started, and the young couple stated that as a result of their previous discussion, they had made plans to legalize their union.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> We are interested in reaching the hearts of people. Our warm and sincere approach can help us do this.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> God’s Word exerts tremendous power upon its hearers. Look what it has done for us. What it says is more powerful than anything that men can devise or speak. (Heb. 4:12) Truly, its worth is beyond compare!</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Even though the Bible is the world’s be</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">st-seller</span><span class="font12">, there are many homes without ”one. And among those who do have a Bible, many do not read it. Some translations are difficult to understand. So getting a modern-language translation may be just the thing that will encourage more people to read God’s Word. Their use of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font12"> can aid them in getting the sense of the Scriptures. </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Can you </span><span class="font12">help others to benefit from it?

<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> One way to highlight the value of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font12"> is by featuring the section “Bible Topics for Discussion.” For instance, you could say: &quot;The Bible has much to say about the lasting happiness that Jehovah’s government will bring. To illustrate, notice how helpful the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> is in its ‘Bible Topics for Discussion’ section. Here under the subject ‘Earth’ some fine scripture references are found. See how long peace will exist under that government.” (Read Psalm 72:7 and Isaiah 9:6, 7 under the subheading “A. God's purpose for the earth.”) “Other fine topics are found in this section of the Bible. May I leave the Bible and this book with you for a contribution of $4.50?” Of course, other Bible topics can be selected depending on what you feel is appropriate for the occasion.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Another outstanding feature of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font12"> that will help its reader to get a clear understanding of many scriptures is the 92</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">-page index o</span><span class="font12">f Bible words. </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">After haying used the Topic for </span><span class="font12">Con</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">versatio</span><span class="font12">n, you could illustrate its value this way: “There*seems to be little peace today even within families.

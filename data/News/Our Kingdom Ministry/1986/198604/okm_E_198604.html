<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In offering </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">True Peace</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> book, how will you</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">2. Make use of illustrations?</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“Be Aglow With the Spirit”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Having something good to share with others contributes to spirited activity. Therefore, we have good reason to be enthusiastic during April when offering the beautifully illustrated, updated book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?</span><span class="font13"> World conditions make peace and security a most timely subject. Thousands of years of human failure have moved many to face the fact that man does not have the answers to his most pressing needs. But we know that God’s Kingdom is the answer. Our being able to point this out by use of God’s Word and our having this fine publication to offer should help us to “be aglow with the spirit” in our service during April.—Rom. 12:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> But placing the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace</span><span class="font13"> book is just a first step toward realizing our objective of helping truth seekers to take their stand on the side of God’s Kingdom. We need to return promptly and help interested ones to get a fuller understanding of what we initially shared with them. Otherwise, there is the danger that the wicked one will interfere and snatch away what has been sown in their heart.—Matt. 13:19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOLLOW UP MEMORIAL ACTIVITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> We should also give further attention to those who attended the Memorial. Each year the Memorial attendance in the United States and worldwide is more than double the average number of publishers. What potential for more disciples! So, rather than allow the activity accompanying the Memorial celebration to wane, we should keep helping those who attended to make further spiritual progress. Are Bible studies being conducted with all whom you personally invited? If someone studied in the past, could a frank Scriptural discussion at this point open up the way for resuming a fruitful Bible study? What can you do to help these people while there is time?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">USE THE SUMMER TO GOOD ADVANTAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup>A spirit of zeal moved over 100,000 in this country to serve as auxiliary pioneers last April. This surpassed all previous records for any one month. Have you made plans to join the pioneer ranks this April? Some who do may be able to continue pioneering right through the sum-</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page S, col.</span><span class="font13"> 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">1. Always say you are a Witness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">2. Try to put the householder at ease? How?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL 21-27 In making offer, how might you</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1. Use message from the publishers on page 2?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">2. Describe personal enjoyment of book?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">3. Use table of contents?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">As your companion talks in the door-to-door work, why</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1. Listen attentively?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">2. Look up scriptures?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TOPIC FOR CONVERSATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Where Can You Find True Peace?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 146:3—Men cannot bring lasting peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 119:165—Jehovah is the source of true peace.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> We rejoice to see so many nesy ones flocking into the congregation. (Isa. 60:8) One thing that attracts them to the truth is the love that is evident among Jehovah’s people. (John 13:34, 35) Were not many of us deeply impressed by the warmth and friendliness we experienced the very first time we entered the Kingdom Hall? Having personally experienced God’s love that flows through Jesus Christ and the Christian congregation, we are moved to “work what is good toward all” by assisting and encouraging others. —Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HELP OTHERS PROGRESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> When we see someone. at the meeting for the first time, do we endeavor to get acquainted? We should not feel that only the elders and ministerial servants have this responsibility. It is ourpersonal obligation as well. (Rom. 15:7; compare Galatians 5:14 and James 2:8.) When many in the congregation welcome the new ones, they are impressed with the true Christian love demonstrated. God’s Word speaks very highly of showing love toward strangers. (See Matthew 25:35b and 1 Timothy 5:10.) Such warmth and friendliness encourage, as teady_ip-flux of sheeplike ones into the congregation.—See Isaiah 60:5,11.</span></p></li></ul>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Work What Is Good Toward All”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Last month, many new ones attended the Memorial celebration, and these need help in order to make spiritual progress. If you know someone who attended the Memorial but who is not presently studying, why not try to start a study? Encourage him to attend the meetings and offer to accompany him to the Kingdom Hall. Encourage him to do personal study, and as he grows in knowledge and appreciation, help him to prepare to comment at meetings. Your patient, loving interest may lead to his gaining Jehovah’s blessing and everlasting life. —Rom. 15:1, 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7U</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Young ones associated with the congregation are also “related to us in the faith” and need our help and encouragement. (Gal. 6:10) Even small children delight in attention from adults. Children who do not have parents in the truth especially need our encouragement. Youths who are orphans in a spiritual sense deserve our loving consideration and attention.—Jas. 1:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ENCOURAGE PIONEERING</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> We all appreciate the personal interest that others take in us. Those who are working hard in the ministry, including regular and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page S, col. 3)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 142</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Local announcements. Remind all of field service arrangements for the first Sunday of the month. Any desiring to auxiliary pioneer during April can still do so. Have publisher briefly demonstrate use of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book, pp. 179-80, to answer question “Why don’t you observe Easter?” Request all to bring the December 15,1985, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> next week. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20 mln: </span><span class="font13">“Be Aglow With the Spirit.” Questions and answers. On paragraph 3, present brief demonstration showing how a return visit for the purpose of rekindling interest can be made on a Memorial attender who studied previously. In conclusion, encourage all to make summer a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">spiritually</span><span class="font13"> refreshing time, not just a period of recreation and diversion. Announce how many have already signed up as auxiliary pioneers for April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 mln: Topic for Conversation. Discuss and demonstrate topic, using current offer. May wish to read excerpts from </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace</span><span class="font13"> book, page 8, paragraphs 11 and 12, to show superiority of peace and security God will bring in comparison to what men are seeking to do. Conclude demonstration with arrangements being made for return visit. May also demonstrate a publisher tying Psalm 119: 165 in with articles on Bible found in April 1 issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font13">Mention that April 15, May 1, and May 15 issues also have articles that can be tied in with the last scripture in Topic for Conversation. In this way, magazines can be presented when book offer is not accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 162 and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 122</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Local announcements, Announcements in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> and accounts report. Ask brothers to bring April 15 magazine next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: “Self-Control Vital for Christians.” Talk with audience participation, based on article in the December 15, 1985, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> Make practical local application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">20 min: “Presenting the Good News —Through Effective Street Witnessing.” Questions and answers. After discussing material, demonstrate suggestions in paragraphs 3 through 5. Ask audience for additional suggestions that are effective in your territory. Encourage support of magazine activity this Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 107 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 101</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font13">Local announcements. Briefly demonstrate magazine presentations, using the April 15 issue. As time permits, ask audience for further suggestions on talking points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">18 min: “Work What Is Good Toward All.” Question-and-answer discussion. Read and discuss scriptures as time permits. Encourage all to welcome new ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Interview a few regular and auxiliary pioneers, inquiring as to what made them want to pioneer, how they arranged to pioneer, and what obstacles or problems they overcame. Prepare in advance so comments will be practical, helpful, and encouraging to others who are progressing toward pioneering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 116 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Local announcements. Also, “Make Good Use of Older Tracts.” Let congregation know which tracts are on hand. Publishers may have supplies of tracts at home that should be put into service bag for use in field. Only those still presentable should be used. Encourage all to share in magazine work on fourth Saturday of month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">20 min: What Do You Treasure? A talk with some audience participation, stressing keeping spiritual goals to the fore and maintaining confidence in Jehovah’s power to provide. Important to answer this properly since heart is centered on what we value most highly in life. (Matt. 6:21) Guarding heart, seat of motivation, and channeling its desire in right direction bear on our everlasting life. (Prov. 4:23) Taking a wrong view of material things, whether rich or poor, can lead to misplaced trust or becoming overly concerned about lack of material advantages. (Prov. 10:15; 18:11; Luke 12:15) Most valuable possession is a good relationship with Jehovah. (Ps. 63:3, 4; 73:27, 28) Material things will be of no value on day of judgment. (Prov. 11:4) Important to maintain proper balance now while pursuing spiritual goals. (Prov. 30: 8, 9) Christians should be encouraging spiritual goals, such as auxiliary and regular pioneer service, Bethel sind missionary service, or increasing and refining sacrifice of praise to Jehovah. No need for parents to fear they are jeopardizing future of young ones if they set spiritual goals before them. (Ps. 37:25) When important decisions in life must be made, do we prove that our affections sire centered on Jehovsih sind Kingdom interests or on other things? (May get expressions from some in congregation who have set fine exsunple in this regard.) Keep affections fixed on what is everlasting.—Ps. 91:14-16; 2 Cor. 4:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Help Young Ones Share in Giving a Witness. Interview smd demonstrations. Parents have primsiry responsibility to teach young ones from infsincy. (2 Tim. 3:15) All can be conscious of assisting those of tender years when working in service with them. Young ones like to be involved when at doors instead of standing idle. Ask a parent or two with young ones how they involve their children in witnessing at the doors. If old enough, do they have service bag with Bible and literature? How do you introduce young ones and permit them to share in reading scripture or making offer? Briefly demonstrate how a young one can offer householder free tract when offer from older publisher is refused. Also, briefly demonstrate how parent or older publisher may introduce conversation and then allow young one to read scripture. Encourage all to be conscious of assisting young ones to share in giving witness at doors.—See Matthew 21:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 210 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING APRIL 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 108</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">8 min: Local announcements and Theocratic News. Encourage all to share in service first Sunday in May. 22 min: “Use the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> Book in All Features of Your Ministry.” Question-and-answer discussion handled by service overseer or other qualified elder. As time permits, show how introductions beginning on page 11 of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book under heading “Future/Security” and on page 14 under heading “War/Peace” can be used in offering </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace </span><span class="font13">book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: Arrange locally, or have talk on article “Young People Ask ... ‘Can’t We Just Be Friends?”’ (March 22, 1986, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font13"> p. 17) Song 209 and concluding prayer.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Summer also affords opportunities to preach in areas that are seldom worked. During the 1985 service year, publishers, pioneers, and congregational groups aglow with the spirit worked all but 15 of 287 unassigned territories. One family of six felt greatly blessed because they shared in this special activity. They experienced greater unity as a family and became better equipped to handle God’s Word effectively.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Can you include working unassigned territory in your plans for this summer? If you are interested but do not know how to arrange for territory, the congregation secretary will be pleased to review with you the directions given to English-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Use the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book in All Features of Your Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Have you been using the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book in your ministry? Undoubtedly you have already considered various portions of it and have found it very helpful. Of course, it would be beneficial to read it through and become familiar with all the excellent information it contains. A pioneer brother reports that he and his wife have been studying a portion of it every day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> However, it is not necessary to have read the book completely in order to make use of it in the house-to-house work or when making return visits and conducting Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HANDLING OBJECTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Likely there are certain objections you encounter regularly as you go from house to house. These may hinder you in your efforts to capture the householders’ interest. They may say: “I’m not interested,” “I’m busy,” or “I have my own religion.” When such conversation stoppers become an obstacle, by all means take a moment between doors to fix in your mind one or more of the suggestions on pages 15-24 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Your knowledge of the people in the territory will enable you to select a reply that will help you to continue your conversation. Try to use the wording just as it appears in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book. It has been very well thought out and used successfully by experienced brothers. In time, you will be able to give excellent answers to a variety of conversation stoppers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">language congregations in the Society’s letter of January 1,1986.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Another avenue for increased Kingdom activity is evening witnessing. During early evening hours, householders appear to be relaxed and more disposed to listen. No doubt many publishers will want to use the longer periods of daylight to reach people who are not normally found at home earlier in the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“DO NOT LOITER”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> This is not the time to loiter at our business but, rather, to “be aglow with the spirit.” May we all prove ourselves industrious and willing workers. (Heb. 6:11, 12) Thoughtful planning now can make this summer a spiritually memorable one. Our being “aglow with the spirit” will produce positive results inside and outside the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RETURN VISITS AND BIBLE STUDIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> On your initial visit, you may be able to determine that the householder is particularly interested in a certain subject. In preparation for the return visit, look for this subject in the index of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book. If the matter is considered, you will find either a suggestion that provides a direct yet balanced approach or additional Scriptural information that will benefit the individual.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> If a question arises on a Bible study and you determine that it would be best to answer it before you leave, check either the index in the back of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book or the list of principal subjects in the front. For example, someone may have told the interested person that Jehovah’s Witnesses are a sect or a cult. The information you need is given on page 202. It is easily located by looking for “Jehovah’s Witnesses” under “Principal Subjects.” The specific information is even more readily found by looking up “Cult” or “Sects” in the index. Feel free to read the answer just as it appears in the book and discuss it further with the Bible student. Do not be concerned that the student observes you looking for additional information in this way.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13">auxiliary pioneers, benefit greatly when we offer expressions of appreciation for their fine example and personal sacrifices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> When elders and ministerial servants can arrange their affairs to auxiliary pioneer from time to time or even get into the regular pioneer work, benefits extend to the entire congregation. (2,Cor. 9:2) If you are an elder or a ministerial servant, would reasonable adjustments in your life-style enable you to auxiliary pioneer from time to time or perhaps get into the regular pioneer work? If so, you will experience many blessings and will be in a better position to “work what is good toward all.” As we individually look for ways to help and encourage others, Jehovah will add his blessing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Through Effective Street Witnessing</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “True wisdom itself keeps crying aloud in the very street.” (Prov. 1:20) Jesus Christ went from place to place, publicly teaching the good news. (Luke 8:1) Paul preached in the marketplaces, as is evidenced at Acts 17:17. Street witnessing is an effective way of reaching people with the good news today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> We can do street witnessing at bus stops, at entrances to train stations, in front of businesses, or near apartment buildings that are inaccessible to us. How about busy street corners or public parks? When doing street witnessing, we must be careful not to stand in front of display windows, block entranceways, or interfere with the normal flow of traffic.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO DO IT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Approach people! In doing this, we need to be selective. Some experienced publishers try to establish eye contact as they approach the person, and after a warm greeting, they go right into their presentation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Brief presentations are usually best. Using a question or making a statement that will catch the attention of the passerby is quite effective. When presenting the April 8 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> you may want to say: “Good morning. Do you think that the world will ever kick the smoking</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Good Use off Older Tracts</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> A brief printed message that is designed to catch the eye and provoke thought—that is what our </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font13"> tracts have proved to be over the years. So it is important to make wise use of them. Rather than allowing these tracts to lie around and become discolored or soiled, we should be alert to use them in our ministry!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Even though we are not in a tract distribution campaign, publishers can wisely use tracts when the householder does not take the regular offer or the magazines. They may also be left when householders are not at home. Each tract provides a concise summary of a timely subject, making them effective tools in reaching people of various persuasions and interests. At times, a well-chosen tract is most effective in giving a further witness. It is free, can be read quickly, and invites the reader to obtain further information.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">habit? [Allow for a response.] This issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> discusses the question. These two magazines can be yours for 40 cents.” Or you may want to use the colorful illustrations on the cover to begin your presentation. When a person shows interest, you may be able to obtain his name and address, offering to call at his home to continue the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARATION NECESSARY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> To be effective in street witnessing, preparation is necessary. Endeavor to read the magazines ahead of time, and then select a point or two that you believe would interest others. It is helpful to rehearse your presentation with a family member or another publisher. This may help you to see where improvements can be made.—Prov. 27:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> If some apartment buildings in the territory are not easily accessible, street witnessing nearby may be a practical means of contacting the occupants. It may be best to do street work early in the morning as people leave for work or in the evening as they return home. Many encouraging experiences have been enjoyed by those sharing in street magazine work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Yes, effective street witnessing will enable many more to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. Let us do it with zeal and enthusiasm!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Some congregations still have older tracts on these timely subjects: “Is Time Running Out for Mankind?” (No. 16); “The Family —Can It Survive?” (No. 24); “Why Are We Here?” (No. 25); &quot;Hope for Ending Inflation, Sickness, Crime, War” (No. 28); “Is a Happy Life Really Possible?” (No. 29). Make good use of them in your ministry so that they are not wasted. Congregations may order </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font13">Nos. 30 to 33 when additional tracts are desired. You may wish to carry a variety of tracts to present in service. But be sure the tracts you use are still presentable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Literature servants are encouraged to place a supply of the tracts on the counter or at some other convenient place so that those picking up literature can see what is available. No doubt many will be glad to take a supply for the appropriate contribution and use them effectively in the field ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

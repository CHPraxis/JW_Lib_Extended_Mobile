<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Sharing Fully in March and April Activities</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul exhorted the Corinthian congregation to be steadfast and always to have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15:58) That counsel also applies to Christians living in this 20th century. In the spirit of Paul’s words, let us consider how we can share in the many theocratic activities arranged for March and April.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SPECIAL TALK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> During the week of March 9, congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses around the earth will assemble to hear the special public talk entitled “The World’s Insecurity —Is There a Solution?” A question on the minds of many people today is, How can true peace and security come to this earth? Since many view as hopeless the world situation with its violence, terrorism, and war, the information that will be presented is most enlightening. So make a special effort to invite all interested persons to hear this timely talk.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MEMORIAL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> After sundown on Monday, March 24, anointed Christians</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">True Peace and Security</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Last summer at our “Integrity Keepers” Convention, it was announced that the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security—How Can You Find Itf</span><span class="font11"> would be used in the field campaign for April and May. In this way a mighty shout of praise would go up earth wide to Jehovah, “the God who gives peace,” and to his Son, the “Prince of Peace.”—Rom. 15:33; Isa. 9:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> How appropriate that we will have this publication to offer during the United Nations-proclaimed “International Year of Peace&quot;! The subject of peace and security is on the minds of many people. Some expect the United Nations to bring it about. But Jehovah’s servants know that God’s Kingdom in the hands of Christ Jesus is the instrument Jehovah will use to bring in true peace and security.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Do not overlook the word of caution included in the convention announcement. We are not suggesting that the UN proclamation for 1986 is in fulfillment of 1 Thessalonians 5:3, which states: “Whenever it is that they are saying: ‘Peace and security!’ then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them.” We do not know how long Jehovah will peraround the earth, along with their faithful companions, the other sheep, will commemorate the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, remembering all that his death means in the lives of those serving the Grand Creator, Jehovah God. The worldwide Memorial attendance in 1985 was 7,792,109, and this year we expect to have many more honest-hearted ones associating with us on this most important occasion. Use your supply of printed invitations and put forth every effort to continue helping the many new ones who attend. Perhaps a study can be started with some. All can be encouraged to associate with Jehovah’s people on a regular basis.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER ACTIVITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Year by year, March and April have proved to be excellent months in which to share in the auxiliary pioneer service. During March of 1985, over 45,300 enrolled. In April that figure rose to 100,145, the largest number ever in the auxiliary pioneer service in any one month in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col.</span><span class="font11"> 2) mit the nations to campaign for peace and security; however, this may be a significant step leading to further developments as we draw closer to the “great tribulation.” —Matt. 24:21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARE TO OFFER THE BOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Before the April campaign, we should read portions of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace</span><span class="font11"> book to acquaint ourselves with its overall content. If we read the material in the first two chapters, we will no doubt find several excellent points to use as we offer the book in April and May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> After discussing the Topic for Conversation with a householder, we might say: “This happy future is very near when there will be true peace and security. I have with me a timely publication on that subject. Notice this comment in the first paragraph of the book.” We can read paragraph 1 and then continue by saying: “The illustration here at the start of chapter 1 gives an artist’s conception of what the earthly Paradise will be like. Wouldn’t you like to live with your loved ones in such a peaceful and secure environment? [Allow for response.] This publica-</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page If, col. 3)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 128</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">12 min: </span><span class="font11">Local announcements. Call attention to information in article “Increase Magazine Distribution During April and May.” Invite publishers and pioneers to increase personal orders for these four issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> Encourage all to share in magazine work the second Saturday of the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: “Sharing Fully in March and April Activities.” Discussion of article with some audience participation. In discussing paragraph 3, inform congregation of last year’s local Memorial attendance. In conjunction with paragraph 4, inform congregation about the number who shared locally in auxiliary pioneer work in March and April of 1985 and encourage all who can to enroll as pioneers this year. In considering paragraph 5, tell brothers what older publications are on hand locally to feature in the field in March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: </span><span class="font11">Making Good Use of the Topic for Conversation. Have brief demonstrations of effective use of current topic, showing how it can be tied in with the March literature offer. Encourage all to bring </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book with them to next Service Meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 181 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 65</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8 min: Local announcements, accounts report, and Theocratic News. 12 min: “The Congregation Book Study.” Question-and-answer coverage, handled preferably by an elder who is a study conductor. Develop points needing attention locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">25 min: Using </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures</span><span class="font11"> on Return Visits. Talk and demonstrations. Paul compared our work to farmer who not only plants but also waters, then waits for God to ‘make it grow.’ Paul planted by bringing the good news; Apollos nourished and cultivated the field by further teaching. Apollos powerfully used the Scriptures to ‘water,’ and so do we by taking further Scriptural information to interested ones. —1 Cor. 3:5-7; Acts 18:27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Young brother in audience raises hand, is glad he can now use Topic for Conversation in field but has not yet made return visits; unsure, not experienced in using Bible. What if householder has questions he cannot answer? Chairman invites brother to stage. Explains that Jehovah understands our needs and has provided assistance through organization. Shows how </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book covers variety of subjects and questions. Explains how to locate information by use of index as well as list in front of book. Chairman briefly takes part of householder who expresses belief that when Jesus Christ returns, all will see him visibly. (Rev. 1:7) Chairman then helps locate information on pages 342 and 343. Young brother uses information from book, reasons with householder, and expresses satisfaction at being able to give answer, has more confidence now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Chairman continues talk. Many people simply take literature without asking questions or showing particular interest. In many cases we can lay groundwork for return by raising a question. Demonstration: After offer is accepted, publisher refers back to topic and asks: “How can we know for sure that these conditions promised by God will come in our lifetime? I would like to stop by in a few days and point out the answer that Jesus gave to that question.” Householder readily agrees. Chairman asks publisher what is planned for return visit. Publisher refers to material under “Last Days” in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book and some points that will be used to build on what was previously discussed. Following these suggestions in the field may lead to a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Conclude by pointing out that a return visit need not be a lengthy discussion, may use just two or three Scriptural points. May take several visits before householder’s spiritual appetite is awakened sufficiently for Bible study. (Matt. 5:3) </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font11">book can assist because it contains many points that people often wonder about and uses the Scriptures to answer. Encourage all to schedule time for return visits. Trust in Jehovah to draw honest-hearted ones to the truth.—Acts 16:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 156 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 197</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Local announcements and Announcements from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font11"> Emphasize Memorial week Bible reading. Outline local arrangements for the Memorial and encourage use of any invitations not yet distributed. Encourage all to share in magazine activity fourth Saturday of month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: “Presenting the Good News —By Thorough Territory Coverage.” Questions and answers. Highlight points that apply to local territory. Include one or two good local experiences on working not-at-homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">20 min: “True Peace and Security.” Five-minute talk on paragraphs 1-4. Have four short demonstrations using points in paragraphs 5-8. For paragraphs 5 and 6, take up demonstrations after Revelation 21:3, 4 has been read. Review demonstrations with audience as time permits and conclude with points in paragraph 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 97 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 84</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5 min: Local announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">Local needs. May review appropriate counsel and suggestions received during last visit of circuit overseer or build up anticipation for next visit, if scheduled soon. Or talk based on article in January 1, 1986, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> “Jehovah—Simply Grand!” Involve audience in discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1986 Yearbook.</span><span class="font11"> Elder conducts discussion with three or four exemplary publishers who review some interesting field experiences. Select from the following: See yb86, p. 16, par. 1; p. 18, pars. 4, 5; p. 21, pars. 1, 3; p. 22, par. 3; p. 29, par. 2; p. 33, par. 2; p. 44, par. 2. (May use other experiences too.) Encourage all to read entire </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1986 Yearbook </span><span class="font11">for great spiritual benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Special Activity in April. Stirring talk by service overseer. Outline arrangements for field service. Remind congregation of how many are auxiliary pioneering in April and that it is not too late to turn in an application. Include comments from audience on how they are enjoying </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace</span><span class="font11"> book and why they feel it will be beneficial for the territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase Magazine Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">During April and May</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Plan now for increased distribution of magazines during April and May. Four consecutive issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> will feature cover subjects highlighting the Bible as a book of promises that do not fail and as a source of practical counsel for our guidance in a turbulent world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The April 1 cover will feature “The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?” April 15 follows with “The Bible—A Book for All Mankind.” The cover feature for May 1 will be “The Bible —Practical for Modern Man?” and “The Bible and Your Future” will be featured on the cover of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> for May 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Since many will be enrolled as auxiliary pioneers during these two months and everyone is being encouraged to give these magazines wide distribution, now is the time to order extra distributors’ copies. Additional copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> should also be ordered according to the congregation’s needs.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Congregation Book Study</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The Congregation Book Study fills a vital need in our spiritual progress. We should all hold it in high esteem. If some regularly miss this meeting, could it be that they regard it as less important than the other meetings? All can benefit from taking a fresh look at the Congregation Book Study arrangement.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CONDUCTOR’S ROLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The conductor should be a serious </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">student</span><span class="font11"> of God’s Word. He is usually one of the shepherds, or elders. To be effective, he must prepare well and analyze how the material can contribute to the spiritual growth of those in attendance. He should carefully listen to the comments and take an interest in the individual progress of those under his care. At the same time, he needs to be kind and considerate, encouraging all to participate and yet not embarrassing anyone.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> A good teacher will make sure that the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">main ideas</span><span class="font11"> are highlighted. The conductor will be alert to recognize inaccurate comments and will tactfully see that the correct thought is expressed. He should be selective in assigning a brother as reader each week and when calling on individuals to read </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">key</span><span class="font11"> scriptures.—Titus 1:9; Phil. 1:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THOSE ATTENDING</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Advance preparation on the part of all in attendance is important. There may not be enough time during the study to read all the cited scriptures. But if you look them up ahead of time, you may be able to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sharing Fully &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">the United States. A few necessary adjustments in your schedule may allow you to enjoy this field of activity along with others in your congregation. Each week the congregation should be informed of how many have been approved to serve as auxiliary pioneers. This may encourage others to enroll. No doubt many elders and ministerial servants, along with some of their family members, will be able to share in this feature of the service, thereby setting a fine example for others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE LITERATURE OFFER</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> During March, efforts will be made to distribute certain older books that the congregation may have on hand. These will be offered at the reduced contribution of 50e each. (See announcement in January </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> for details.) This campaign gives congre-comment on them. You can also practice pronouncing difficult words or names in cited scriptures. We are all encouraged to give comments and to strive to do so in our own words. This will help us to express ourselves better when sharing Bible truths in the ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> An atmosphere conducive to learning should be maintained at the Congregation Book Study. Thus, parents should endeavor to control youngsters so they do not disrupt the meeting. It is appreciated when brothers open their home for the study and endeavor to maintain a meeting place that is clean, well lighted, and properly ventilated. By being truly hospitable, they make others feel welcome. (Prov. 3:9) Of course, those attending the study should respect the home and show appreciation by not abusing the facilities or taking undue liberties. As with all other congregational meetings, our dress, grooming, and decorum should bespeak the dignity associated with our worship of Jehovah.—See page 63 in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font11"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> The Congregation Book Study also provides valuable training for the field ministry. We can be conscious of field points expressed during the study. Making comments can help us to overcome timidity and become better acquainted with the Scriptures. A positive view of the Congregation Book Study arrangement will indeed increase our appreciation for the way Jehovah cares for his flock.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">gations the opportunity to get the older books into the hands of people who will benefit from reading them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> In April we will be offering the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security —How Can You Find It?</span><span class="font11"> The contribution for this publication will be $1.00. With 1986 having been designated by the United Nations as the “International Year of Peace,” the message found in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace </span><span class="font11">book is very timely, since it focuses attention on the real means for bringing peace.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> As you can readily see, March and April offer us “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” Bearing in mind the yeartext for 1986, “Go.... declare abroad the kingdom of God,” all of us have our assignment of work to perform in declaring abroad God’s Kingdom in the hands of Christ Jesus, the genuine hope for true peace and security.—Luke 9:60.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> As the number of Jehovah’s Witnesses continues to grow, we find that we are working our territory more and more often. In some areas, territories are being worked as frequently as once a week. This gives people more opportunities to hear and respond to the truth as we preach the good news of the Kingdom.—Rom. 10:13-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Consider the island of Guadeloupe in the Caribbean. There is a ratio of one publisher to every 81 persons on that island. Obviously, they are covering their territory often, and they are getting results. They ended the last service year with a new peak of 4,064 publishers, and a total of 5,092 studies were conducted. For the past service year, they had a 14-percent increase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REALLY COVER THE TERRITORY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> While we may work the territory often, what can we do to ensure </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">thorough</span><span class="font11"> territory coverage? For one thing, we can keep an accurate record of not-at-homes. If possible, try calling on these later the same day, as some people may be out for just a short time. As for others that we do not find at home on that day, endeavor to contact them on a different day and perhaps at a different time of day. Some have found that by making not-at-home calls, it takes about twice as long to work the territory. This means they are not calling so frequently on the same individuals. Nevertheless, they are doing a more thorough job of covering the territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> If we are not able to make such calls soon, we should give the list to someone who can, maybe an individual who takes the group out on a different day. Thus, those who are not at home on weekends could perhaps be called on during the week.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11">we should endeavor to contact someone from each family. In some localities, separate homes are located behind houses fronting the streets, and we must be sure to call on those too. Thorough territory coverage would include contacting people who work in business establishments that may be in the territory.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Another aspect of thoroughly covering our territory is to follow up interest diligently. Where brothers have limited territory, they are more inclined to do this. They call back on everyone who shows interest, with a view to starting Bible studies. Do we also keep in mind such objectives?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">COVERING UNASSIGNED TERRITORY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> The Society sent to all congregations in the United States a letter dated January 1, 1986, explaining the matter of unassigned territory. If you are interested in working some of that territory and you have not already written to the Society, discuss this with the elders right away. While much of the unassigned territory is worked each summer by individual publishers or by congregations who make special arrangements, there are some areas that have not been covered for several years. How fine it would be if all unassigned territory in the United States could be worked this summer!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> As we cover our territory repeatedly and strive to do so thoroughly, some householders may complain or ask why we call so often. By using one of the suggestions on page 15 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font11">book, we may arouse their interest; otherwise, they might be disturbed by our frequent calls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Thoroughly covering our territory with the good news will result in salvation to some who listen to us. (1 Tim. 4:16) In time, we will rejoice in saying, in the words of the apostle Paul, that we “no longer have untouched territory in these regions.” —Rom. 15:23.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">e The following countries all reported 10-percent increases and new peaks in October: Guadeloupe (4,219), Martinique (1,913), and Curacao (1,243). Publishers in Curasao averaged 13.3 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">* Puerto Rico had new peaks of 20,702 publishers and 17,180 studies in October. A new peak of 896 regular pioneers was also reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">* Taiwan had a new peak of auxiliary pioneers In October. They averaged placements of 135.6 magazines, and congregation publishers averaged 20.2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">* Zimbabwe's publisher figure of 14,811 in October represents a third consecutive peak. The figure of 580 regular pioneers Is 22 percent over last year’s average and 18 percent over last year's peak.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">tion will help you to see how you can find such peace and security, and it is yours for a contribution of just $1.00.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> As another presentation, after reading Revelation 21:3, 4, we could turn to page 19 and say: “There is an interesting paragraph that drives home how much we need that happy future promised by God.” After reading paragraph 24, we could continue by saying: “Note also the thought on the next page in paragraph 28. [Read the paragraph.] This book has been published to help you to learn about God’s solution to world problems and to understand better what the future holds. It is yours for a contribution of $1.00.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Be sure to call back on people who have previously shown interest and offer this book to them. We might find it appropriate to remind the householder of previous conversations about God’s promised New Order and then say that we have a Book that outlines what we have to do to find true peace and security. We could turn to page 91, read paragraph 12, and then say: “What else is required to assure survival? This book goes into detail as to God’s requirements from this point on. It is offered for a contribution of $1.00.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> This would also be a fine publication to place with individuals who have studied in the past but who have not yet taken a stand for Jehovah. We could read paragraph 1 on page 175 and then point out that the book will help them to understand what they must do now to make the right choice, so as to find true peace and security.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Let us make plans now to offer </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?</span><span class="font11"> during the special campaign in April and May. We will be helping others to find true peace and security from “the God who gives peace.”—Rom. 16:20.</span></p></li></ul>

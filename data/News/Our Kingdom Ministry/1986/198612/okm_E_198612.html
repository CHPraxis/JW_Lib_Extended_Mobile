<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Appreciate Their Value?</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> It was a thrilling moment when the speaker at the 1978 “Victorious Faith” International Convention released the new Bible study aid </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories.</span><span class="font14"> Its potential for teaching the Bible to young and old alike was quickly recognized. Adults were pleased to learn that the stories are in chronological w-dg£. This has helped many to become acquainted with the sequence of Bible events.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> One mother whose thre</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">e-year</span><span class="font14">-o</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ld son</span><span class="font14"> had a very short attention span was pleasantly surprised to see him quietly “studying” the book for 20 minutes. It soon became a practice with him. A young couple began te</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">aching their sOTi</span><span class="font14"> frotiTThe </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font14"> book shortly after they had begun to study the Bible. On one occasion, when the family was about to eat a meal, the boy refused to eat until a prayer was said.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Since the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font14"> book was first released over eight years ago, 2</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">3 million copi</span><span class="font14">es have been printed in </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">66 language</span><span class="font14">s. We appreciate the value of this fine Bible study aid and are in a good position to offer it wholeheartedly t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">o young an</span><span class="font14">d </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">old </span><span class="font14">alike during December.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“LOOK.'” BROCHURE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah presented us with another treasure this past summer in the form of the new brochure </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Look! I Am Making All Things</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Go Make Disciples!’—Do You?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> One of the greatest joys you can have as a Kingdom publisher is to help someone take in accurate knowledge of the truth. As the person grows in knowledge and appreciation, your heart will swell with joy and gratitude to Jehovah. We are fully aware that while we share in planting and watering the seeds of truth, it is Jehovah who makes them grow. However, what a thrill it is to have a part in directing an honesthearted one onto the road to life!—1 Cor. 3:6-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Are you a family head? If so, are you regularly conducting a Bible study with your family? This is a very important matter. Family heads are responsible before Jehovah to instruct and guide their family members in the way of life. (Deut. 6:4-7; Eph. 5:25-29; 1 Tim. 5:8) By all means, shoulder your responsibility to make disciples of them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> In addition to your family Bible study, can you also conduct a study with someone else? A more important question may be: Do you recog</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">New.&quot; A</span><span class="font14"> pioneer sister from Texas who was having difficulty starting studies recently wrote: ‘By just letting the householder see t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">he beau</span><span class="font14">tiful cove</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">r pictur</span><span class="font14">e, discu</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ssing it</span><span class="font14">, showing the scriptures. at the bottom of page 4* then readi</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ng the firs</span><span class="font14">t four par</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">agraph</span><span class="font14">s, you have started a study!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MAKING THE OFFER</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> When working in your area, you might say: “As a neighbor of yours, I would like </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">to share som</span><span class="font14">e good </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">news</span><span class="font14"> about a reliable promise That soon there will be peace worldwide. Isn’t that something you would like to see? [Pause for reply.] We have all observed the efforts of men to accomplish this goal. But notice who it is that the Bible says will bring lasting peace. [Read </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Psalm </span><span class="font14">4618^-9.] Once war and'those who promote it are gone, never again will God permit hostility on the earth. We a</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">re assured</span><span class="font14"> of this by the words of the inspired writer of </span><span class="font13">Psalm 72-7. [Read ] </span><span class="font14">The ones God will preserve to live on a peaceful earth will be those who have learned about him and who serve him. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories</span><span class="font14"> has helped many people to do that. I am sure you will be greatly encouraged by reading it. This copy can be yours for a contribution of just $2.50.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">nize the privilege and responsibility that is yours to teach someone else the truth in obedience to Jesus’ command? (Matt. 28:19, 20) It would appear that many more publishers in the United States could conduct a home Bible study. In some areas it takes real persistence to obtain a study. Repeated return visits are necessary. Maybe you have tried but just have not been able to find someone that is willing to study. What can you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ATTITUDE IMPORTANT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> You might start by asking yourself: What is my attitude toward the Bible study work? Do I really want a study? Do I look upon this part of the ministry as important and lifesaving, realizing that the majority of people in the world are ‘dead in their trespasses’?—Eph. 2:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> Publishers and pioneers alike have written to the Society telling how Jehovah answered their fervent prayer when they asked him</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Those who exert themselves in doing good things for others prove to be real ‘neighbors.’ (Luke 10:36, 37) Like the Samaritan benefactor in Jesus’ illustration, Jehovah’s Witnesses expend much of their strength, their time, and their material resources in helping others. During the past few years such neighborly spirit has been outgta</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">ndingly ma</span><span class="font1">nifested throughout this country in the Kingdom Hall building program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> As Jehovah has continued to ‘speed up’ the work and to give the increase, in the United States the 1986 service year ended with 207 more congregations than there were the previous year. (Isa. 60:22) Happily, the loving concern shown by so many of Jehovah’s people has helped to provide some of the Kingdom Halls needed for the growing number of congregations. The fine support given to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund has been very much appreciated, as have the efforts of the thousands who have volunteered their time and skills to assist in constructing new Kingdom Halls and renovating others.—Ps. 110:3; John 13:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> The generous giving of the brothers has made it possible for the Society Kingdom Hall Fund to assist in the co</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">nstruction of 244 new </span><span class="font1">Kingdom Halls in all </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">48 states</span><span class="font1"> under the United States branch. These are ac</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">commodating </span><span class="font1">ove</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">r 370 e</span><span class="font1">o</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:line-through;">ngr</span><span class="font1">a</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:line-through;">gat</span><span class="font1">i</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:line-through;">on</span><span class="font1">s. During the past year alone, financial assistance has been provided for </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">132 new Kingdom Hall projects</span><span class="font1">. (Some of these are shown in this insert.) Congregations that may not have been able to obtain financing otherwise have been aided. Many other congregations have constructed or renovated additional Kingdom Halls by making their own financial arrangements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Even though much has been accomplished in providing new and improved Kingdom Hall facilities, a pressing need remains. A recent s</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">urve</span><span class="font1">y indicates that o</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">ver 200 additional new Kingdom Halls are needed n</span><span class="font1">ow. More will be required to accommodate future growth. Thus, arrangements are being made to accelerate our Kingdom Hall building program. As more c</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">ontributions</span><span class="font1"> are received, other con</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">gregations</span><span class="font1"> will, be. able to obtain Ioans through the Society Kingdom Hall Fund.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> As a means of accelerating the Kingdom Hall construction program, the Society is now appointing elders to serve on Regional Building Committees to assist with Kingdom Hall construction. Many of these spiritually qualified brothers have secular </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">experience</span><span class="font1"> in construction, real estate, business, safety, and other related fields. Thus, they are in a position to offer valuable guidance from the beginning to the completion of a project, whether it involves new construction or renovating buildings for use as Kingdom Halls.

<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> The Society recommends that skilled workers be scheduled as their particular trades are needed during the period of construction.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">DESIGNS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>10</sup> There is a need to be judicious in selecting building designs so as to avoid placing an unnecessary burden on either the local brothers or the resources of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. While we plan for our Kingdom Halls to be attractive in appearance, it is appropriate that they be simple and functional rather than pretentious. We are happy to inform you that for this reason the Society has produced a variety of new Kingdom Hall designs that are available to congregations involved in building projects. These will be provided to the elders upon written request to the Kingdom Hall Desk.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>11</sup> Give careful thought to selecting a plan that will accommodate the present needs of the congregation(s) and allow for a reasonable amount of growth. All factors should be carefully weighed so as to build a hall that is neither unnecessarily large nor too small.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>12</sup> In some rare instances, it may be advisable for congregation elders to consult a local attorney experienced in zoning matters before proceeding with plans for the actual construction of a Kingdom Hall. While this may be an added expense, it could save the congregation extra costs later. In communities where the brothers know in advance that their project will be viewed favorably by the local city departments, this legal assistance will likely not be needed. However, where a congregation anticipates that problems will arise, it might be the course of wisdom at the outset to seek competent legal counsel locally.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRESSIVELY MEETING THE NEED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>13</sup> How can a congregation know when it qualifies for assistance from the Society</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Kingdom Hall Fund to build a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font1"> Kingdom Hall? Periodically the Society arranges for surveys to be taken to determine which congregations have the greatest need for a new Kingdom Hall. Priorities are determined on the basis of the surveys made, plus other relevant factors. Then, as funds become available, the Society progressively initiates correspondence with such congregations. However, if a congregation faces an emergency situation, the elders should feel free to contact the Society regarding its need.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>14</sup> If a congregation has in mind </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">renovating or enlarging an existing Kingdom Hall, </span><span class="font1">it may be guided by what was stated a year ago, namely: “Congregations faced with urgent remodeling or repair needs can contact the Society, since some funding is available for such projects from time to time on a limited basis.”—See </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font1"> December 1985, insert, paragraph 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>15</sup> If congregations are in a position to move forward with their construction projects because locally they are financially able, there is no objection to their doing so.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE NEED IS URGENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>16</sup> The principal meeting place used by congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses is the Kingdom Hall. It thus plays an important role in the growth of true worship. As dedicated witnesses of Jehovah, taught by him, we regularly assemble together “to incite to love and fine works.” (Heb. 10:24) What a blessing it is to see increasing numbers of people joining with us because they, too, want to be instructed by Jehovah and walk in his ways! (Isa. 2:3) In course of time, this continuing growth calls for the building of even more Kingdom Halls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>17</sup> The Society is aware that the economic situation today has made it difficult for some congregations to acquire adequate facilities for their meetings and that there is an urgent need to assist these congregations. This is one reason why the Society Kingdom Hall Fund was set up to help congregations in financing construction of needed Kingdom Halls.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>18</sup> The generosity of the brothers in contributing to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund is particularly noteworthy and contrasts sharply with the world’s selfish “me-first” attitude. These contributions are an expression of brotherly affection and love, and they give evidence that we are interested in those “related to us in the faith” and want to do good for one another. Such fine qualities along with our positive action on behalf of others have a sure reward: “For if these things exist in you and overflow, they will prevent you from being either inactive or unfruitful regarding the accurate knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.”—Gal. 6:10; 2 Pet. 1:7, 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>19</sup> Do you remember how Jehovah’s people responded to King David’s appeal and contributed generously to build the house of Jehovah’? 1 Chronicles 29:6-9 says that ‘the people gave way to rejoicing over their making voluntary offerings, for it was with a complete heart that they made voluntary offerings to Jehovah.” That same spirit motivates Christians today to continue showing concern for their brothers and sisters in other congregations that need adequate Kingdom Hall facilities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>20</sup> Giving of our time and resources to assist in providing new Kingdom Halls is a fine way to honor Jehovah. (Prov. 3:9) Sharing in an effort to help other congregations to obtain needed Kingdom Halls is in harmony with 2 Corinthians 8:14, 15, which mentions that “an equalizing” takes place. Let it be our constant prayer that Jehovah will continue to bless and direct our efforts in this activity to his praise.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Throughout the 43 years of its operation, the Theocratic Ministry School has proved to be a success. It has helped us to be more effective when making public declaration at the meetings and in the field ministry. Thousands of brothers throughout the earth have been trained to be skilled public speakers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> What about you personally? Are you taking full advantage of the school? Has your ‘advancement become manifest’ in the field ministry and in your meeting assignments? (1 Tim. 4:15) Do you have a continuing desire to improve in your ability to speak “delightful” and “winsome” words?—Eccl. 12:10; Luke 4:22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">INSTRUCTIONS TO BE OBSERVED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> According to the 1987 Theocratic Ministry School Schedule, Talk No. 1 will be based on material in the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;AU Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.’’</span><span class="font14"> Speakers assigned to give this talk should stick to the material specified so as to cover the main points. Some of the written review questions are based on this material. Only ten minutes is allotted for the instruction talk, and this does not permit bringing in extraneous points or information not directly related to the subject.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> As to “Highlights From Bible Reading,” this should not just be a summary. After giving a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">brief</span><span class="font14"> overall view of the assigned chapters, the speaker should help the audience to appreciate </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font14"> the information is valuable to us.

<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> You may be thinking that you do not have the ability to speak as others do. Even so, most of us have the God-given ability to speak, and with Jehovah’s help we can all progress in speaking the truth more effectively. Educationally speaking,</span></p></li></ul>

Remember, the light of truth continues to get brighter. Our understanding of it gets clearer and clearer. The Theocratic Ministry School can help us to keep pace with advancing truth and equip us to speak “the word of God with boldness.”—Acts 4:31.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> Each week we have a scheduled program of preparatory study. We should do our best to follow this schedule, since all the material cannot be covered in the assigned talks. We benefit from being in attendance, listening to the presentations by the students, and considering the counsel given. We can benefit further if we put the material into application in the field ministry and in our own meeting assignments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> Since 1971 we have been using the excellent reference book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook. </span><span class="font14">Have you become thoroughly familiar with it? The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook </span><span class="font14">provides a basis for counseling the students.

When you have an assignment to prepare, do you use the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook</span><span class="font14"> to study the points of counsel that you should be working on, and do you keep these in mind while preparing your assignment? Is it clearly evident to you and to others that you are benefiting from the school?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> By having an active share in the Theocratic Ministry School, we will allow Jehovah to ‘teach us his ways.’ (Ps. 25:4, 9) Then, as we speak the truth fearlessly, it will be seen that we have “the tongue of the taught ones” because we take full advantage of the Theocratic Ministry School—a loving provision from Jehovah.—Isa. 50:4.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">During the Holidays</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> During this time of year many people are desperately trying to enjoy some happiness amid the cares of this world. Have you ever felt a negative attitude about trying to witness to such people during this period of obvious preoccupation? Despite the abuses and excesses prevalent during the holiday season, the minds of many are turned to God as they hear the oft-repeated phrase “Peace on earth, goodwill toward men.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> We will no doubt meet many people who are genuinely busy during the holidays. This will require consideration on our part. When Jesus was on earth, he not only recognized the feelings of others and felt pity for them but also recognized their need and endeavored to help them. God-fearing people today have the same need for the Kingdom message.—Matt. 9:36, 37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> When a householder comes to the door, try to be aware of the circumstances in the home and to be considerate. Is he busy entertaining guests or in the midst of elaborate preparations? Then it may be best to make your presentation brief. However, in another case you may discern that a person is not really busy, and by showing kindness and a sincere personal interest in the individual, you may be able to proceed tactfully with a witness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT COULD YOU SAY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> After a friendly introduction, you might say: “Much is being said these days about peace on earth and goodwill toward men. Have you ever wondered if real peace on earth will come, and if so, how it will be brought about?” Allow householder to reply, and then proceed with the current Topic for Conversation and the literature offer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> If you sense that a briefer presentation would be appropriate, you</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Appreciate Value &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> If the householder already has the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font14"> book or if it would be more appropriate to offer the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Look!&quot;</span><span class="font14"> brochure, you might use the suggestion given in paragraph 4. Or you may point ou</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">t one </span><span class="font14">of the subhe</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">adings</span><span class="font14"> in the brochure that you believe would be of interest to the householder. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Look!” </span><span class="font14">brochure is designed especially for starting new Bible studies. So when you show the householder the subjects discussed, direct attention also to the questions at the bottom might say: “At this time of year, we find many people thinking about the birth of Jesus. That was a most important event. May I show you what the Bible says about another very important event—the coming of God’s Kingdom? It was Jesus himself who said . . . [Read Matthew 6:33.].” Then offer the householder the current offer, featuring a point about the Kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> If people wish us a happy holiday, there is no need to make an issue over their holiday greetings. Rather, we can briefly thank them for their kindness and time in listening to us. Of course, if they specifically ask us how we feel about the holidays, we will answer truthfully and respectfully. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font14">book provides some excellent information on pages 176-8 that will help you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SHOW CONSIDERATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> On Christmas Day and New Year’s Day we can show consideration by not calling too early. Instead of disturbing those who want to sleep late on those days, it may be more appropriate for us to begin our house-to-house activity a little later than usual. Or we could start our service by making some return visits on those we know are in a position to receive us. We appreciate the wisdom of the apostle Paul’s counsel: “In every way we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers.”—2 Cor. 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> Many good experiences have resulted from sharing in holiday witnessing. However, there will be a need for all of us to be tactful and to present the message of truth in a way that appeals to the heart and mind of the householder. Remember Paul’s counsel at Colossians 4:6, and “let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt.&quot; This fine counsel is especially appropriate during the holidays.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">specifically to help them find interested persons with whom to conduct Bible studies. (Rom. 12:12; 1 Thess. 5:17) Have you done this? Have you made supplication to your heavenly Father for the privilege of finding and teaching someone who is sincerely searching for the truth?—Ezek. 9:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> During the 1985 service year, there were 447,298 Bible studies conducted on the average each month in the United States. This is indeed commendable. During that same period of time 9,021,009 Bibles, books, and booklets, as well as over 88 million magazines were placed. So the Society’s publications are to be found in many homes where studies are not yet being conducted. Thus, it is apparent that there is a fine potential for starting more home Bible studies.</span></p></li>

Do you share in the ministry with a positive attitude, realizing that the angels are assisting in the work by directing Jehovah’s people to the doors of those who desire to hear the “everlasting good news”? (Rev. 14:6) The great joy that will be yours as you help another person to learn the truth will more than compensate for the effort you put forth to follow Jesus’ command to ‘go make disciples’ and teach them.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> All of us rejoiced to see the lovely four-color covers on the January 1 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and the following issues. Yes, this is now a permanent feature! So, let us zealously recommend to all persons who show interest that they read all of the year’s 24 issues of these colorful magazines. The subscription is still only $4.00!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">REACH AS MANY AS POSSIBLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> What can you do to reach as many as possible with the subscription offer in February? One thing is to prepare a list of those you can visit, such as former Bible students, relatives, workmates, neighbors, schoolmates, and teachers. Last month you perhaps left individual magazines with some who were busy at the time you called. Or someone may have shown interest in a particular issue. Return and offer the subscription this month. These people are already acquainted with you and may be open to further discussion. If they have already enjoyed one issue of the magazine, their interest may be aroused to obtain it regularly by subscribing. During February, make a special effort to call on these individuals.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The Topic for Conversation “What Does the Future Hold for</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Showing Appreciation for the Pioneer Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jesus encouraged his disciples to “beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” (Matt. 9:37, 38) Some are showing appreciation for this need by doing more in the witness work. In the United States during the 1985 service year, an average of 38,489 reported as auxiliary pioneers each month. The peak month was April when 100,145 shared. Over 44,000 are now serving as regular pioneers. Each month, more continue to join the pioneer ranks and are experiencing the benefits and blessings that come with such increased activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> What are some of the blessings that come to those who can increase their share in the ministry so as to pioneer? Daily thinking and talking about God’s Word is in itself an outstanding benefit. Increasing their time in field service to some You?” helps us to think about our own future. In discussing this topic with a householder, help him to picture what the future can hold for him. This may motivate him to think seriously on the subject and encourage him to look for answers about the future. How can the Topic for Conversation be used to present the subscription in an effective manner?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARE A PRESENTATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book provides some helpful material under the subheading “Future/Security” on page 11. The first suggestion may effectively be adapted to introduce the current Topic for Conversation. You could say: “Good morning. How are you? ... We are sharing with our neighbors a positive view of the future. Do you find that some situations make it hard to be positive? . . . I have found the Bible very helpful in this respect. At Revelation 1:1, the Bible shows that God is the one who reveals what the future holds for man. [Read.] While men are uncertain as to what will take place in the future, there is no uncertainty with God. At Revelation 21:3, 4, his Word says clearly concerning the future: [Read scripture.] Does that sound good to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">90 hours each month generally results in contacting more interested persons, placing more literature, making more return visits, and starting more home Bible studies. This means more spiritual giving, helping more people to learn the truth and become disciples of Jesus Christ. Sharing in the pioneer service also brings the blessing of increased happiness.—Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ENCOURAGE PIONEERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Not everyone is able to pioneer, but all of us should show appreciation for the pioneer service and encourage and support those who have taken up this vital work. How can this be done? We can arrange to work with pioneers in the house-to-house ministry and offer to go with them on return visits. Pioneers often have no one to work </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font11"> 4, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

Encourage all to learn, rehearse, and use Topic for Conversation. Be positive in presenting the subscription offer. Be sure to carry subscription slips at all times. It may be that Jehovah’s spirit will move householder to subscribe. When subscription is not taken or the householder is busy, the two magazines and a copy of the brochure </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Government That Will Bring Paradise</span><span class="font11"> may be offered for a contribution of 70®.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> What if the householder is busy? You may be able to feature a particular article in the magazine by saying, “We have something brief for those who are busy.” And then the first article of the February 15 issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> might be presented: “Many people today see the future of man as gloomy and withers? This section of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font11">book can be beneficial as we use the Topic for Conversation.

In conclusion, encourage all who can to serve as auxiliary pioneers in March (which has five weekends) and April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15 min: “Presenting the Good News —Using the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> Book.” Questions and answers. Demonstrate suggestions in paragraphs 3 and 4. Choose those appropriate to your territory. These demonstrations should be brief and well prepared. After each demonstration, have audience comment on why material from book will be effective in local territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 34 and concluding prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">out hope. Some have even linked the Biblical apocalypse, or Armageddon, to human extinction, thus stirring fear in the heart of their fellowman. However, the article ‘Apocalypse—What Is It?’ clearly defines what the Biblical apocalypse really is. I feel confident that you will be encouraged by reading </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> We are offering a year’s subscription of 24 issues for a contribution of $4.00.”</span></p>

This enormous distribution of literature brings the responsibility of calling back on interested people to help them become disciples.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Commendably, this responsibility is being taken seriously. Last year we made a total of 47,204,243 return visits and conducted, on the average, 447,298 home Bible studies each month. Jehovah added his blessing, and 34,348 were baptized. How very happy we are to be involved in the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise to speed up the work. —Isa. 60:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Perhaps some are not making return visits regularly. Still others are not yet conducting a home Bible study. If you physically and circumstantially can, are you? If not, would you not really like to expand your ministry beyond the initial placing of literature from house to house? What can you do to reach out, making effective return visits and conducting Bible studies?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> First of all, develop a positive attitude, trusting that Jehovah will bless your efforts.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> All over the earth there are still many sincere people who are not yet servants of Jehovah but who are “sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done” in Christendom.

Such people need the comforting hope of the incoming New Order with its Paradise of complete peace and security.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> For such honest-hearted ones, the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security —How Can You Find Itf</span><span class="font11"> is being published. This is a revision of an earlier publication on the same theme. The book thoroughly answers questions about why there is no true peace and security now, how it will come, when we will know it is near, and what we should do about it individually. It alerts people to the significance of world events. It shows them whether or not they should place any confidence in</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Of course, there are problems to be overcome. It may require extra effort to arrange with others to make return visits in the evening when you are more likely to find people home. Strong religious prejudices may need to be broken down. You may find people who enjoy our literature but hesitate to study because of opposition or ridicule. If you live in a high-crime area, it may require extra caution. You may have to overcome the fear some people have of strangers. These challenges can be overcome. Others who have been successful can help you to face them skillfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Do not allow a reluctance to take on responsibility or a feeling of inadequacy hold you back from enjoying the return visit and Bible study work. Trust in Jehovah and pray for his spirit to help you. Keep a good house-to-house record of all literature placements and other interest that is shown. Call back soon.

The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace</span><span class="font11"> book takes note of the declaration by the United Nations that the year 1986 begins special efforts by world leaders toward ‘peace and security.’ Referring to this declaration, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace</span><span class="font11"> book says: “This, no doubt, is a step toward the fulfillment of Paul’s ... words... . Yet the prophecy shows that the time will come when the nations will declare that they have achieved a measure of ‘peace and security.’” —1 Thess. 5:3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Each one of us desires to ‘handle the word of truth aright.’ (2 Tim. 2:15) That Word is “the sword of the spirit,” which in the hands of Jehovah’s people can overturn strong, lofty reasonings. (Eph. 6:17; 2 Cor. 10:4, 5) In our efforts to help people, what a valuable tool we have in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book!</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> We have many opportunities to use the practical suggestions in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book. Not only are there the fine introductions presented on pages 9-15, but on subsequent pages there are excellent suggestions to help us answer sincere questions and deal with potential conversation stoppers. Which of these have you found useful in continuing a conversation about the future?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The current magazines on the apocalypse may prompt questions from the householder. If appropriate, you may be able to continue the conversation using points in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book under such headings as “Armageddon,” “Government,” “Kingdom,” or “Last Days.” Or if someone says, “These things won’t happen in my lifetime,” turn to page 233, where it says: “But it is going to come in someone’s lifetime, isn’t it? . . . Would anyone be able to know that his generation was the one to see it? Jesus’ own apostles wanted to know that, and the answer he gave them is very significant for us today.” (Luke 21:29-32) Or you may wish to use the information on page 234 or page 242.

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Encouragement and moral support are important. One traveling overseer reported that not all have been encouraging in their comments to pioneers. We should highly value the importance of pioneering and show appreciation for the effort put forth by those who are able to adjust their affairs to have a share in it. All of us should continue to strengthen our own love for the field ministry and the pioneer service.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Some persons might express doubt that God is going to do anything to change matters. We could reason with them, using the points under “Wickedness” on pages 430 and 431. Then direct their attention to the article “Apocalypse —When?&quot; in the February 15 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> (which shows that survivors of the generation of 1914 will live to experience the foretold apocalypse) or the closing paragraphs of that article under the subheading “Apocalypse—Prelude to Paradise.”</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Good experiences are being enjoyed by those who are using the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book. While doing street work, one brother engaged a passerby in conversation. The man asked questions, some in an argumentative way. After answering a number of the man’s questions, the brother decided to make use of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book. He simply read from the appropriate section, offering an occasional “That’s interesting, isn’t it?” The man’s attitude changed immediately. Seeing the facts </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">in print</span><span class="font11"> made the difference. Before leaving, he even asked where our meetings are being held. All of this took place on a busy street.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Our use of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book may bring similar good results.

Sacrifices of a personal nature must often be made in order to continue in the work. (Heb. 13:15) There is a need to keep up with the spiritual food supplied by the faithful and discreet slave so as to stay spiritually strong. All of this requires considerable effort and good planning, as successful pioneers can testify.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ABUNDANCE OF FINE WORKS PRODUCED IN APRIL Include* New Peak of 725,799 Publisher*</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Over 1,000,000 Bound Books Placed</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The April report brings joy to our hearts! What a privilege to share zealously in so many fine works! (Titus 2:14) We give thanks and praise to Jehovah for prospering our efforts. The extent of the marvelous witness given is reflected in the report below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Publishers: 725,799. This surpasses our March peak by 1,918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Auxiliary and Regular Pioneers: The total number of auxiliary pioneers was 96,084. which was commendable. While this is not a new peak, when this figure is added to the new peak of 45,786 regular pioneers, the combined total is 5,182 over the total of auxiliary and regular pioneers in April 1985.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Hours: 15,413,888. This is 977,814 over our peak in April a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Return Visits: 5,085,665. Exceeds our previous peak in March by 106,943.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Home Bible Studies: 524,548. This is more than 11,000 over our peak last March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The sum total of our activity for April, when added to what is being done worldwide, represents a fine spirit of godly devotion and self-sacrifice. It emphasizes, as Jesus foretold, that his followers would do 'greater works' in giving a Kingdom witness. (John 14:12) May we all keep on sharing joyfully in such “works” to God’s glory.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagerly Share the Good News</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> How favored we are to have received the good news of the Kingdom! No longer do we put our trust in men who cannot fulfill their promises. Our confidence is in Jehovah and in the assured hope of everlasting life under his Kingdom government. (Ps. 146:3; Titus 1:2) All mankind need to hear the good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom, and we are eager to share it with them!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Jesus instructed his followers to be his witnesses “to the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) We heai' that command today and are glad to obey, for he is the King of the Kingdom and to him we joyfully subject ourselves.—Matt. 28:19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SUMMER ACTIVITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The summer months open up for many of us greater opportunities to</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Will You Join the Pioneer Ranks Soon?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> About this time last year, thousands of our brothers and sisters were giving prayerful consideration to entering the regular pioneer work. Careful planning helped many to start serving Jehovah in this special way, thus swelling the regular pioneer ranks from 37,220 in August of 1985 to 42,209 in September, an increase of almost 5,000. Are you among those who are giving thought to entering the regular pioneer ranks during the 1987 service year?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">APPRAISING YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Perhaps the exciting reports of recent theocratic expansion have awakened in you a desire to have a greater share in the harvest work now under way. (Matt. 9:37, 38; Isa. 60:22) Fine! However, to become a reality, your desire must be coupled with careful planning and complete reliance on Jehovah. (Rom. 12:1; Luke 14:28) Could your employshare the good news. While we are on vacation or when traveling to conventions, we may find numerous occasions to give a witness. When we stop for fuel, eat at a restaurant, ride public transportation, or stay somewhere overnight, there will be people whom we may be able to engage in conversation. We can tell them about our convention or the peace God’s Kingdom will bring, and we may be able to leave tracts or magazines with them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> In planning your summer activities, you may find it helpful to set goals for yourself and your family. One important goal would be to attend all four days of the “Divine Peace” District Convention and fully benefit from the rich spiritual program. Joining with our brothers</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page If, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ment be adjusted to make room for the pioneer service? Can you simplify your life-style to make more time and energy available for Jehovah’s work? (Luke 11:34) Some families have been able to sponsor one or more of their members in the pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">INCREASING YOUR FAITH AND ZEAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Entering and remaining in the regular pioneer work require strong faith. If you want to make your faith grow, plan to spend additional time in the preaching work and experience Jehovah’s help. (2 Thess. 1:3) For many, auxiliary pioneering has proved to be a stepping-stone toward the regular pioneer work. Perhaps it can be the same for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■' Those considering the pioneer work would also do well to speak</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Song 43</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">13 min: </span><span class="font13">Local announcements. Demonstrate following alternate Topic for Conversation. Theme: Living on Earth Forever—Is It Possible? Use Titus 1:2 to point out that we have a sure promise of everlasting life. Then, Proverbs 2:20, 21 can be read to show that everlasting life is to be enjoyed on earth by righteous ones. Appropriate portions of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book can be used to illustrate these points. This optional topic will allow for greater variety, especially where territory is worked frequently. Encourage all to share in field service on first Sunday of July. Review arrangements for witnessing on July 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">17 min: </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures.</span><span class="font13"> Discussion between elder and young brother who finds himself attracted to the world. Elder uses material in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book, pages 389-93, “Spirit of the World.” Elder defines spirit of the world and explains why being tainted by it is cause for concern. (1 John 5:19; Rev. 12:9) Elder draws brother into discussion and reasons along following points: Damage to our spirituality if spirit of world influences our thinking and desires. World’s spirit based on pride and rebellion against Jehovah. What must be done to break free from spirit of world. Need to avoid Eve’s self-willed course and resist tendency to rebel against authority. Ways in which spirit of world manifests itself in conduct of people today. Pitfalls of materialism; its relationship to spirit of world. How improper speech and actions contribute to wrong spirit. Contrast Bible makes between spiritual and physical mem. Do not idolize humans. Elder concludes with experience showing we really do not miss out on anything if we do not get involved in worldly activities. In African land, at age of nine, young girl had to leave land where work was banned and move with family to another country where she spent 14 years in a refugee camp. All her teen years devoted to peaceful life revolving around Bible study and meetings. Now she is in full-time service. Although she did not have access to world and its entertainment, did not miss anything! Young brother expresses appreciation for discussion. Song 80 and concluding prayer.</span></p>

Talk and demonstrations based on pages 117-21. Barnabas was known as a warmhearted and generous person. He willingly gave of himself to help his brothers. His visit to Antioch was a stimulus to the new disciples. His warm words and thoughts moved the new disciples “to continue in the Lord with </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">hearty purpose.&quot;</span><span class="font13"> (Acts 11:23) Giving encouragement effectively brings results.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUTHS —PLAN WISELY FOR THE FUTURE!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Many of you younger brothers and sisters have recently finished your required schooling or now have a reduced schedule during your final years of high school. No doubt you are giving much serious thought to your future. As you make such plans, be sure to ‘remember your Grand Creator’ and consider His timely counsel. Take seriously what he has in store for the earth and obedient mankind. (Eccl. 12:1) Entering the pioneer work during the new service year could safeguard you from settling into less worthy pursuits that may sidetrack you from your real purpose in life. (Prov. 10:22) As you “taste and see that Jehovah is good,” may the joy and satisfaction you experience in full-time service motivate you to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Not Neglecting the House of Our God</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “Guard your feet whenever you go to the house of the true God; and let there be a drawing near to hear.” (Eccl. 5:1) Yes, Jehovah’s place of worship is special to us, and so our care for the Kingdom Hall as well as our conduct while there should show that we recognize it as a place to be “taught by Jehovah.” (Isa. 54: 13) Do you have such appreciation for your Kingdom Hall?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> As Kingdom expansion continues, many have shown appreciation by contributing to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. Jehovah blesses such thoughtful generosity and devotion to true worship. But what are we doing to help maintain our place of worship in good condition?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDUCT IMPORTANT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> When we invite others to attend meetings, we should do so with confidence that what they observe there will represent well Jehovah’s name and Kingdom. As the true God, his “dignity is above earth and heaven,” and our conduct when at the Kingdom Hall should uphold this dignity. (Ps. 148:13) Never would we want our dress, grooming, or conduct to disturb our brothers and sisters or stumble someone who may be visiting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Each one should exercise neighbor love and be careful not to cause distractions. Whispering, eating, chewing and snapping gum, rattling candy wrappers, making unnecessary trips to the rest room, and habitually arriving late all interfere with others’ concentration and detract from the dignity due Jehovah’s place of worship. “Love ... does not behave indecently,” and such poor manners are out of place in the Kingdom Hall. (1 Cor. 13:4, 5; Gal.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">make it a lifelong career.—Ps. 34:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>c</sup> Our appreciation for Jehovah should move us to do all we can in his service. For those whose circumstances permit, this may mean entering the pioneer ranks. But circumstances of others may not allow for it at this time. However, we can all keep the matter before Jehovah in prayer, thus giving evidence of having the pioneer spirit. Some currently serving as regular pioneers felt at one time they could not pioneer. However, circumstances can change or be changed if we couple our desire with careful planning and sincere prayer for Jehovah’s blessing on our efforts to serve him to the fullest extent possible. (Prov. 16:3; Mal. 3:10) May we all work toward that end and wisely plan for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">6:10) Worldly meeting places are often unsightly and even damaged when people carelessly dispose of chewing gum, candy, and food. All of us, and especially parents of young children, should take care that we do not spoil Jehovah’s building in this way.—Compare Deuteronomy 23:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ARRANGEMENTS FOR CLEANING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The body of elders (and the Kingdom Hall Operating Committee, if more than one congregation uses the hall) schedules regular cleaning and maintenance of the building. Cleaning is usually done on a weekly basis by book study groups, following a checklist of necessary things to be done. All will want to be sure to follow carefully the schedule provided so that the care of the hall can be carried out “decently and by arrangement.” (1 Cor. 14:40) Additionally, an occasional special day for thorough cleaning may be scheduled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> When the Kingdom Hall is used by more than one congregation, it is especially important to be conscious of our responsibility in maintaining the hall. In such cases, the building is subject to much more wear and tear, but our cleaning assignment comes less frequently. We should mark our calendar to remind ourselves about cleaning assignments. Book study conductors and their assistants should be alert to remind their groups well in advance of each assignment.—See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> page 61, paragraph 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">DOING OUR PART</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> All of us will want to support our group when it is assigned to clean the Kingdom Hall. This assures that the burden does not fall on just a few, and we benefit from the wholesome activity and good association. But we do not have to wait for an assigned turn to clean. As individuals and as families, we can help tidy up the hall after meetings. If we see paper on the floor, we can pick it up; if chairs are not aligned, we can help straighten them. How satisfying it is to see Jehovah’s place of worship sparkle as a result of our efforts!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Nehemiah recognized the importance of ‘not neglecting the house of our God.’ (Neh. 10:39; 13:11) We recognize that our Kingdom Hall is the center of true worship in our community and as such deserves our loving attention and care. By our conduct and by supporting arrangements for cleaning, may all of us uphold the dignity of Jehovah’s place of worship.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With Empathy</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> ‘Lovers of themselves, selfassuming, haughty, and puffed up with pride.’ (2 Tim. 3:1-5) How aptly the Bible describes the generation in which we live! The materialistic way of life and the me-first philosophy of today have caused men to isolate themselves and to be unconcerned with their neighbor’s welfare. Empathy, the ability to put oneself in the other person’s place, is not frequently observed among people in the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Showing empathy is a necessity if we are to be successful in our ministry. This is not always easy. We, too, are confronted with problems and anxieties that can hinder us from thinking of others. What can we do to make sure we do not become lax in this regard?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CULTIVATING EMPATHY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> We should consider the needs of our neighbors. By doing so we will be imitating our heavenly Father. Jehovah loves people and appreciates their needs. He likes to see his creatures happy. Hence, he was moved with pity and compassion to provide mankind with a ransom, saving them from their sinful state. —John 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The world of mankind is in dire need of God’s Kingdom. It alone can provide a lasting solution to the problems that plague us. Learning about this Kingdom has helped us to cope with our problems and has set us free from Babylonish religion. By putting ourselves in the place of the householders, we will be moved with pity and compassion to share with them the truth from God’s Word, enabling them to experience the joy we have come to know. —John 8:32, 36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Jesus carried out his ministry with love and heartfelt feelings for mankind. He showed deep concern for people, and those that listened to him knew that he cared for them and sympathized with their situation. (Luke 5:12,13; Mark 6:32-34) Our personal love for neighbor will also become evident if we cultivate and demonstrate empathy just as Jesus Christ did.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DEMONSTRATED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> How can we demonstrate that concern in our ministry? We need to be discerning, take note of the householder’s circumstances and comments, and put ourselves in his place. Ask yourself: If I were in his place, what words would console or interest me? Then proceed according to what you discern to be of interest to him. If you see that he is not in a position to converse, then shorten the discussion, perhaps offering the latest magazines or a tract and promising to call at a more convenient time. By discerning what concerns the householder and being empathetic, we are in a better position to share the Kingdom message in a heartfelt manner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Experienced publishers especially need to demonstrate empathy when helping new ones in field service. Recalling our own initial hesitancy and feelings of nervousness when starting to go from door to door, or perhaps when giving our first talk, can help us to maintain the proper mental attitude. Reflecting on how others helped us will enable us to know what to do and say when giving counsel and instruction to new and inexperienced ones. By showing patience, love, and a genuine willingness to assist, we will be able to help them make spiritual progress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Showing empathy for those in the field and to our brothers and sisters reflects the Christian personality. Let us always look for opportunities to demonstrate it, following the example of Jehovah God and of his Son, Christ Jesus.—Eph. 5:1, 2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Share Good News &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">in such united worship is a joyous privilege. (Ps. 95:6; 100:2) Auxiliary pioneering is another excellent goal for the summer. Why not spend school vacation time during July and August as an auxiliary pioneer? Invite others to do the same, and work together in sharing the good news.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Your congregation may have as a summer goal a more complete coverage of territory, and you can support that too. It may be possible to assist a nearby congregation in working territory that has not been covered for some time. How about not-at-homes in your own congregation territory? If certain residents are consistently not at home, are not such homes like unworked territory? With more daylight hours, try making late afternoon or early evening calls. Those not home on Sundays may be found during the week</span></p></li></ul>

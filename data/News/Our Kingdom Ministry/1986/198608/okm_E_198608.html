<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The apostle John heard 24 elders in the heavens praise God, saying: “You are worthy, Jehovah, ... to receive the glory and the honor and the power.” (Rev. 4:11) All of Jehovah’s servants today can extol God with similar words of praise. (Ps. 148:1,12,13) We can do this during August by using the new Topic for Conversation and offering one of the suggested brochures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> The literature offer for August allows us to be versatile in adapting our presentation to the needs of the householder. We will be offering </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!, The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever, or The Government That Will Bring Paradise.</span><span class="font13"> Prepare to offer whichever brochure seems to be most appropriate for the territory as well as the person that you meet at the door.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> After introducing yourself, you might say: “Mankind has suffered much throughout history. What do you think is the reason for this? [Allow for a response.] The Bible explains that man is incapable of governing himself well. [Read Ecclesiastes 8:9.] This scripture shows that it is impossible for humans to establish a government that will really bring lasting happiness. Only God can do that. Notice what the Bible says God’s government will accomplish.” [Read Micah</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “We have just had the refreshing visit of our traveling overseer ... and our expressions of gratitude need to be forwarded to you for assigning such a fine servant of Jehovah to our area.” The Society quite often receives such comments of appreciation for traveling overseers. Timely visits from experienced older men help us to make spiritual advancement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In the first century, traveling elders accomplished much in building up the congregations. They gave needed counsel. (1 Thess. 2:1, 10-12) They brought direction from the governing body. (Acts 16:4, 5) They related experiences from other parts of the field, showing how the good news was reaching others. (Acts 14:27, 28) What stimulating occasions such visits must have been!</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Are you a young praiser of Jehovah or someone who is just getting started in field service? The following presentation may help you to have a share in placing brochures during August. After giving your name, you could say: “I would like to leave with you a brochure that shows how a heavenly king will bring lasting happiness to mankind. Notice what is stated above picture number 49. [Read comments.] You will find it interesting to examine the pictures and read the scriptures that are cited in this brochure. It is yours for the contribution of 30c.”</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> A fine way to praise God is by exalting his name Jehovah. After giving your name, you may say: “I have been talking with your neighbors about the importance of knowing the name of the true God. Have you noticed that not many people use God’s name or know what it stands for? [Allow for a reply.] The Bible says at Psalm 83:18 that God’s name is Jehovah. His name means that he fulfills his promises. One of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1) </span><span class="font13">itual growth. However, in order to derive the fullest benefit possible, we individually need to have the proper mental attitude and give full support to the activities organized during each visit. How can this be done?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPER MENTAL ATTITUDE AND PREPARATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> First, we should ‘brace up our minds for activity.’ (1 Pet. 1:13) To do this, we need to have the right point of view of the visit and make specific plans to have an enlarged share in the ministry. Can you auxiliary pioneer during the month of the circuit overseer’s visit? Could you adjust your daily routine so as to work in the field service during the week? Could you schedule return visits or a Bible study for a weekday afternoon?

Then, continue by opening the brochure to page 31 and say: “Notice these comments concerning the value of knowing God’s name. [Read paragraph 1.] The information in this brochure is very enlightening. You may have this copy for a contribution of 30c.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Householders have different interests or needs. Some are religious and still read the Bible. Others like to talk about politics and government. Those limited in their reading ability would likely appreciate a simplified text with illustrations. Hence, when we talk to a person we need to discern what his interest is and offer him the appropriate brochure. May we all have a share in praising Jehovah during August by offering the brochures as we preach the good news of the Kingdom. cussion with all paragraphs being read.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The information presented in the meetings during the circuit overseer’s visit can also add to your spiritual growth. Listen carefully to his talks and be prepared to participate in the special program “Continue in the Things That You Learned.&quot; You may want to take notes of interesting Scriptural points or of counsel given. The pioneer meeting can help regular pioneers and those currently serving as auxiliary pioneers to improve the quality of their ministry. Meetings with the elders and ministerial servants enable these spirit-appointed men to receive needed counsel and direction from God’s organization. All of this serves to strengthen the congregation. —Acts 15:36, 41.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Traveling overseers serving the 378 circuits and 38 districts in this country have many years of experience in the truth and in the fulltime ministry. These brothers and their wives give of themselves wholeheartedly. Every six months or so, it is a privilege to share in a week of spiritually stimulating Kingdom activity with them. It would be wise on our part to take full advantage of the circuit overseer’s visit and receive whatever spiritual gift he may impart. (Rom. 1:11, 12) Plan now to benefit from this provision for your spiritual progress.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The opening words of Isaiah chapter 54 call upon Jehovah’s wifelike organization to prepare for joyous increases. Growth, expansion, and renewed strength are in the offing. Fulfillment of that exciting prophecy has resulted in the phenomenal expansion of true worship we now see as Jehovah speeds up the ingathering work. —Isa. 54:1-4; 60:22. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">C&lt;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Can Jehovah’s organized people keep pace with this present God-given increase? The results of Jehovah’s blessing present a challenge that must be met, and we are happy to see that Jehovah has given his people the needed spirit of wisdom and understanding. (Col. 1:9,10) We must agree that through the faithful “slave” class Jesus Christ has directed matters efficiently for the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose in a marvelous way.—Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SIMPLIFICATION NECESSARY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> A major factor in resolving problems arising fr</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">om rapid growth</span><span class="font14"> has proved to be the simplification of procedures. Jehovah’s visible organization has demonstrated an awareness of this important fact. During recent years we have .seen n</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">umerous simplification meagme</span><span class="font14">s t</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">aken</span><span class="font14"> regarding rod</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ming</span><span class="font14"> and food service arrangements at conventions, literature orders and shipments, the ob</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">taining of congregation </span><span class="font14">supplies, Memorial invitations, handbills, and circuit assembly programs. Publishers, pioneers, congregations, elders and ministerial servants, traveling overseers, and the Society have all benefited greatly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> It now appears to be the course of wisdom and good judgment to introduce additional simplified procedures. We are confident that these also will have Jehovah’s blessing, since they will allow for handling further increases in praises~to him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT GROWTH HAS MEANT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> During the past few years, we have seen outstanding in</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">creases in</span><span class="font14"> the number of congregations in the United States? There has been an even greater increase in the number of pioneers. In just the last fom<sup>-</sup> years 634 new congregations have been formed, and the number of regular pioneers has increased by more than 100 percent! Now there are well over 45,000 regular pioneers and more than 8,300 congregations reporting field service to the Society each month. How thrilling it is to observe that brothers and sisters everywhere are being motivated to increase their activity in the harvest and that thousands have been able to enter the pioneer service!—Matt. 6:33. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">it/A*/</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> In order to care for the volume of work this increase brings, further simplification is called for. A great deal of time is being used to enter nearly 55,000 congregation and individual regular pioneer reports in the Society’s records each month. There has also been a corresponding increase in mail received from congregations and pioneers. Because of this increase in volume of mail, we have not always been able to respond to important correspondence as quickly as we would like, especially during certain busy times of the year. The need to simplify certain procedures s</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">o that our re</span><span class="font14">sources and </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">tone can be utilize</span><span class="font14">d to the best advantage has become quite evident.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SIMPLIFIED REPORTING ARRANGEMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>7</sup> A simplified way for regular pioneer reports to be tabulated and sent to the Society will go into eff</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ect S</span><span class="font14">epte</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">mber 1,</span><span class="font14"> 1986&gt;This, along with other adjusted organizational procedures, has already been explained to the elders. The information provided in this insert should help all to understand the simplified procedure affecting the way pioneers report their field service. By becoming thoroughly familiar with what is stated here, elders and pioneers may quickly recognize the advantages to themselves as well as to the Society, and all should be able to follow this procedure without difficulty when making the September field service reports.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>8</sup> The individual monthly Regular Pioneer Report form (S-200)<sup>1</sup> will no longer be sent to the Society; therefore, supplies of these have not been mailed to the congregations for the 1987 service year. Starting with reports for the month of September 1986, all regular pioneers will us</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">e</span><span class="font14"> the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Field</span><span class="font14"> Service Report form (S-4) when reporting their ministerial activity to the congregation. The regular pioneer hour requirement is figured on a yearly basis. The congregation secretary will continue to record carefully the pioneer’s field service report each month on a Congregation’s Publisher Record card (S-21). This will ensure that the congregation will have the pioneer’s correct total of hours, placements, and other activity at the end of the service year. When a pioneer fails to meet the goal of hours for the month, he should be sure to state the reason on the back of his S-4 report, just as lie did previously on the S-200 Regular Pioneer Report form. The secretary will note this reason in the “Remarks” column of the Congregation’s Publisher Record card. As pointed out later in this insert, provision will be made to inform the Society of the total hours for each pioneer at the end of the service year, and any reasons for failure to meet the hour requirement will be stated on that report.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> The congregation secretary should continue to mail the Congregation Report (S-l). to the Society each month, just as he has been doing. The report will show the total field service activity Tor publishers, auxiliary pioneers, and regular pioneers. This </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">has</span><span class="font14"> not changed. One feature of the report that will be different is that on the b</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">at^fe</span><span class="font14"> of the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">S^l fo</span><span class="font14">rm<sup>(</sup>there will be a place to advise the Society when a pioneer changes congregations or when there is a name change, such as when a single sister gets married. Previously, pioneers could inform the Society of a change in their congregation or name by noting this information on the back of their pioneer report. Now the se</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">cretar</span><span class="font14">y will be responsible for advising us of changes by indicating such on the back of the Congregation Report. Whenever a name change is reported, the pioneer’s Watchtower Identification and Assignment card (S-202) should be re</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">turned</span><span class="font14"> by the s</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ecretary</span><span class="font14">, and the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Society will issue the </span><span class="font14">pioneer a new card showing the adjustment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>10</sup> At the end of the service year, the secretary will continue to^ send the Congr</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">egatio</span><span class="font14">n Ana</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">lysi</span><span class="font14">s </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Report</span><span class="font14"> (S-10)to the Society as in previous years. Beginning this September, the </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">sec</span><span class="font14">retary will list on the back of the S-10 form the names of all who are active regular pioneers as of September 1 an3 give their total hours for the months they pioneered consecutively through the end of the service year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>11</sup> By now congregations should have a supply of the simplified Application for Regular Pioneer Service form (S-205). We request that </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font14"> the revised application form be used. With each new pioneer appointment, we will send a blank application form so that the congregation will always have some on hand.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>12</sup> The entire body of elders, and particularly the Congregation Service Committee, will want to take a personal interest in the pioneers. The following questions will help the elders to see where they can render assistance to the pioneers: Are they effective in most features of the ministry, or do they need training in the return-visit or Bible-study work? Are they reflecting the fruitage of the spirit, working together in peace and harmony? (Rom. 14:19) Do any need help in making a practical schedule? Are good study habits evident, and do the pioneers participate in the meetings? Elders, who are interested in doing all they can to help the pioneers, will be discerning as to pioneer needs and circumstances and will communicate with them regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>13</sup> The elders’ loving interest in the welfare of the pioneers is deeply appreciated. In their letters to the Society, pioneers frequently include comments about how grateful they are for having a loving body of elders who have taken an active interest in them. At times, it has meant being able to remain in full-time service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>14</sup> Elders are expected to uphold the high standards set for pioneers, which include the hour requirement. At the same time, though, if a pioneer is experiencing </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">temporary</span><span class="font14"> problems that result in his falling behind in meeting his hours, alert elders will be quick to give assistance rather than suggesting that the pioneer will be removed if he does not improve. They should not allow problems to go on for many months before giving assistance; otherwise, the pioneer may fall so far behind in his time that he becomes discouraged and wants to stop.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>15</sup> Is the problem one that can be resolved in a few months? If so, how can the elders help? If it is a personal problem that the pioneer himself has to work out, the elders can bolster his spirits by giving encouragement and commendation along with practical counsel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>16</sup> Elders should exercise care not to involve themselves needlessly in personal or family matters if help is not requested. However, if a problem is serious and it does not appear that the pioneer will be able to meet the hour requirement for many months, the elders may decide that it is best for the pioneer to go off the list until the problem has been solved.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>17</sup> Rather than writing to the Society, pioneers should discuss with the elders any difficulties encountered. In most cases where further assistance is needed, it may be best for the elders to write. During the circuit overseer’s visit, pioneers should feel free to approach him regarding matters that could affect their pioneer service. Following this procedure has a number of benefits. The elders know the individual personally. They are in a position to understand his personality and disposition —whether he is diligent or self-sparing, well-disciplined or somewhat disorganized. They are aware of his family circumstances, his health, secular work schedule, and other factors that affect his ability to pioneer. We believe that the elders are in a very good position to determine if someone should try to continue pioneering or whether it would be better for him to terminate his full-time service for the present.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>18</sup> If, after talking with the pioneer, the elders determine that the problem is of a temporary nature and that he should be able to make up the time deficit before the end of the service year, matters need not be taken beyond the giving of encouragement and helpful suggestions. But if the pioneer has encountered an unusual situation beyond his control, causing him to get so far behind in his time that the deficit cannot be made up by the end of the service year, the elders should decide whether or not special consideration as described in paragraphs 18-20 of the February 1978 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font14"> insert should be extended to him. If they find that there is a basis for granting special consideration, they can make a notation on the Congregation’s Publisher Record card and encourage the pioneer to work hard at reaching the hour requirements from that time forward without worrying about the deficit. Should the elders decide that the problem is not of short duration and that circumstances make it advisable for the person to discontinue pioneer service for the present time, they should inform the Society to this effect by submitting the appropriate form. Only in situations where the elders are uncertain as to the application of what is stated in that insert would there be a need for the Congregation Service Committee to write the Society for more information. They should be sure to provide full details of the problem, including a record of the pioneer’s field service hours for the current service year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>19</sup> At the end of each service year, when listing the names of all regular pioneers and their total field service hours for the year on the back of the Congregation Analysis Report, the Congregation Service Committee should write a brief letter giving the reasons why any pioneers failed to meet the hour requirement for the year. Comment should be made on what the pioneer’s prospects are for improvement during the new service year. No reply will be made to such comments unless the Society feels there is a need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>20</sup> We are also asking circuit overseers to give more attention to the needs of the pioneers. The circuit overseer’s visit with the congregation is brief and may not permit him to spend a great deal of time with each pioneer. However, as a result of his checking the records, meeting with the pioneers, and working with them in field service, he will see where there is a need for help and encouragement. He should work in the field ministry with as many pioneers and publishers as his schedule will allow. Where there are many pioneers, he may be able to work with some during one visit and others on his next visit. He will inform the elders of any observations he may have on those needing assistance and suggest what they might do to help the pioneers improve.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DO YOU QUALIFY FOR REGULAR PIONEER SERVICE?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>21</sup> In order to qualify for the regular pioneer service, an individual must be </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">baptized</span><span class="font14"> at least </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">six months</span><span class="font14"> and be a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font14"> publisher. He should be in a position to meet the yearly field service quota of 1,000 hours. It is also important that he have good morals and that he has shown himself to be exemplary as a Christian. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(om</span><span class="font14"> pp. 113-14) What does this include? What qualities should the elders look for in a pioneer applicant?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>22</sup> Exemplary</span><span class="font14"> conduct means being clean in body and spirit. A person approved for pioneer service must have a reputation for fine Christian conduct inside and outside the congregation. He is one who is wholehearted and fully devoted to Jehovah. The fruitage of God’s spirit must be evident in his life. A pioneer’s chief interest should be the Kingdom-witnessing and disciple-making work. He should be able to use the Bible effectively at the doors, make return visits on those who show interest, and start and conduct home Bible studies. Pioneers are to cooperate fully with the body of elders in field service and meeting arrangements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>23</sup> A full year</span><span class="font14"> must have passed from the time a judicial reproof was given or since reinstatement following disfellowshipping before one could be considered for auxiliary or regular pioneer service. Furthermore, a person who is currently under any restrictions by a judicial committee would not qualify for such pioneer service privileges until all restrictions are removed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>24</sup> Are several months of auxiliary pioneering required before one can be recommended as a regular pioneer? No. However, keeping the schedule of a regular pioneer is usually easier if one has served as an auxiliary pioneer first. Elders will want to have a reasonable assurance that the one applying can consistently report 90 hours each month and be able to meet the requirement of 1,000 hours by the end of the service year. Requirements that have not been specified by the Society should not be imposed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>25</sup> When a member of the congregation fills out an Application for Regular Pioneer Service and presents it to the presiding overseer for approval, the Congregation Service Committee should give it </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">prompt</span><span class="font14"> consideration. The application should not be delayed to wait for one of the elders on the committee who may be away for a week or two. Another elder can substitute for him in his absence. If the Congregation Service Committee approves the application, the body of elders should be informed before the application is mailed so they can consider any further observations other elders may have.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>26</sup> The revised Application for Regular Pioneer Service form requires that the elders give the individual’s </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">average</span><span class="font14"> field service activity for the past six months. Elders should be reasonably sure that the applicant can meet the hour requirement on a regular basis. A publisher’s six-month average may not give a true indication of what he can do on a long-range basis. If one or two months were considerably higher than the others because of an extraordinary effort put forth during those months, this should be considered. In other words, the elders should take an overall view of the prospective pioneer’s field activity for six months. The person may have a high hour average, but if he is accomplishing little in the ministry, the elders may suggest he work on the aspects of his ministry that need improvement before being enrolled as a pioneer. If the elders cannot approve the application at the time they receive it, they should be sure to let him know that they are not sending in the application and explain the reasons why. The elders should explain what he needs to work on in order to qualify. If later the elders feel that they can approve the application and the original application is used, the requested starting date should be changed accordingly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FORWARD WITH ZEAL!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>27</sup> It was in 1962 that the adjustment was made to bring regular pioneers under the local congregation arrangement. Has that move been blessed by Jehovah? If our growing from a monthly worldwide average of 33,560 regular and “vacation” pioneers in 1962 to 322,821 regular and auxiliary pioneers during the 1985 service year is an indication, there is only one obvious conclusion to be drawn. Yes, Jehovah has richly blessed arrangements designed to help the pioneers and further Kingdom interests. Now we are confident that he will bless the further adjustments we have discussed in the preceding paragraphs. Jesus said: “Wisdom is proved righteous by its works.” (Matt. 11:19) How true this has been with respect to the progressive simplification of organizational arrangements and procedures over the years to accommodate the rapidly increasing “great crowd” gathering to Jehovah’s pure worship. —Rev. 7:9; Isa. 54:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>28</sup> Zealous pioneers truly are a blessing to the congregations. They are a splendid part of the answer to our heartfelt prayers to “the Master of the harvest” for more workers in these last days when the harvest is great. (Matt. 9:37, 38; John 4:35, 36) May each one loyally do what is within his power to strengthen the hands of all who have adjusted their circumstances in order to serve in the pioneer ranks. (Prov. 3:27) What happiness this will continue to bring us as we unitedly glorify our heavenly Father by ‘bearing much fruit and thus proving ourselves Christ’s disciples’!—John 15:8.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Paul exhorted Timothy: “Do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.” (2 Tim. 4:5) Regardless of how appealing other personal interests might have been, Timothy devoted his life to God’s work. He slaved alongside Paul, showing that he was truly ‘seeking the interests of Christ.’ (Phil. 2:19-21) All genuine Christian ministers should have a similar spirit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Do you treasure the ministry? Could you make pioneering your career? (Matt. 6:33; 2 Cor. 4:1, 7) There would be the satisfying pleasure of knowing that every day you would have many opportunities to talk to others about Jehovah, helping them to know and love Him. (Ps. 96:1-4) What indescribable joy as we see people respond to Bible instruction! Some of these previously lived immoral, violent, or hopeless lives. Having put away former bad habits and having developed selfrespect, they now serve Jehovah. Pioneering is a meaningful career and can produce lasting good. So, analyze your circumstances and, if possible, set a specific date as your goal for entering the full-time service. Work toward it. Pray for Jehovah’s help to attain it. (Eph. 6:18) The rewards Eire great!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Pioneering with a proper motive and the desire to make spiritual progress will help you to develop a more spiritual outlook on life. It can help you to achieve balance, to budget your time wisely, to handle finances, and to be content with life’s necessities. (1 Tim. 6:6) Pioneering may involve sacrifices. Are you willing to make personal sacrifices because of your love for Jehovah? If so, you will learn to become more dependent on Jehovah and less dependent on yourself.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ENCOURAGE PIONEERING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Today, many Christians are happy that their parents have displayed the pioneer spirit. As one missionary relates: “During my entire childhood my mother was very zealous in the ministry. I think that it was not so much what she said but what she did, her good example, that influenced me very much to have a desire to spend my life in the full-time service to Jehovah.” A sister in the full-time service says: “My mother’s nonmaterialistic attitude and clear view of the truth helped me to avoid getting involved in a secular career.” A young minister said of his parents: “They always set before me the joys and privileges of pioneering, and the blessings that Jehovah pours out on pioneers.... This is something that all parents should do because it certainly helped me. They can encourage the young to serve Jehovah whole-souled.” Jehovah surely remembers and rewards the unselfishness of such loving parents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> We are living in the time of the end when “this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” (Matt. 24:14) Jesus told his followers: “The harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” (Matt. 9:37, 38) The need for workers is even greater now than it was in Jesus’ day. Hence, the pioneers have a large share in extending to others the invitation: “O magnify Jehovah with me, you people, and let us exalt his name together.” (Ps. 34:3) Truly there is nothing that can match the contentment and satisfaction that come with using one’s life in the fulltime service of our Grand Creator. —Prov. 10:22.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Using the Brochures to Start Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> More than 28 million copies of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!</span><span class="font13"> have been published in 129 languages. Millions of copies of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Government That Will Bring Paradise</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever</span><span class="font13"> have also been printed in many languages. During the month of August, our objective is to place these brochures and to start home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> How can a brochure be used to start a Bible study, since there are no printed questions at the bottom of the pages? This can be done by merely reading the brochure with the householder, looking up the scriptures, and discussing the information. However, to do this successfully, we must be familiar with the material in the brochure and be alert to see that the main points in each paragraph are understood by the householder. The following paragraphs set forth suggestions on how discussions can be started in each of the brochures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!: </span><span class="font13">This brochure is easy to understand and has special appeal for younger ones as well as people with limited reading ability. The Scriptural points and pictures are numbered for easy reference. To start a study, ask the householder to open his copy of the brochure to Numbers 4 and 5. Ask him to describe what he sees in the picture. Help him to appreciate how it depicts the perfect start that God gave to Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. Ask him if the earth is a paradise today and allow for his reply. After commenting briefly on the bad conditions in the earth today, turn to Number 49 and explain how Paradise will be restored to earth and how wickedness will be eliminated. Consider with the householder the written comments, the scriptures, and the picture. Then turn to Numbers 1 and 2 and ask the householder who alone can make the earth a paradise. Allow for his comment. Obviously, it would be the same one who made a paradise in the beginning—God. Make arrangements to continue the discussion at a later time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> The Government That Will Bring Paradise:</span><span class="font13"> When placing this brochure, it is suggested that the paragraph on page 3 be considered. A direct approach would be to suggest reading the material on the following pages together in order to see why we need God’s Kingdom so much. Each paragraph could be read and discussed and the scriptures looked up and analyzed. The longer scripture citations may be summarized and the householder could be encouraged to read them as he has time. Help the householder to appreciate the pictures and understand how they tie in with the paragraphs under consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever:</span><span class="font13"> Ask the householder to open his copy of the brochure to page 6. Read the heading “God’s Name—Its Meaning and Pronunciation.” Then ask how he thinks we could find out what God’s name is. Allow for a reply. Then tell him that this portion of the brochure answers the question. Invite the householder to read the first paragraph with you, discuss it, and consider the cited scriptures.

<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> These colorful and informative brochures can serve as steppingstones to a regular home Bible study in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book. A discussion in one of the brochures can help you to determine if the householder is genuinely interested in the truth. Any portion of a brochure that gets the householder’s attention may be considered and it is not necessary to study an entire brochure before going into one of the study books. May we all make good use of the brochures as we help sheeplike ones acquire an accurate knowledge of the truth. —John 17:3.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Progressively Walk in Jehovah’s Way</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This theme will be emphasized in the new circuit assembly program beginning in September. Jehovah’s organization is moving forward. The preaching of the good news continues to expand. Each year, thousands of new ones have progressed and joined our ranks. But to what extent are we making progress individually? The assembly program will stimulate constructive self-examination, giving timely encouragement and admonition based on Paul’s words at Philippi-ans 3:16: “To what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Circuit assemblies play a major role in helping us to walk orderly in the truth. We need guidance that will help us act decisively in turning away from death-dealing worldly ways. We need practical, straightforward counsel that will show us how to make progress by walking in Jehovah’s ways. We also need loving encouragement that will strengthen and motivate us. The new program goes a long way in filling these needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As soon as the dates for your circuit assembly are announced, be sure to make definite plans to be there for all the sessions. Encourage others, especially the newly interested ones, to be there with you and benefit fully from this spiritually refreshing provision.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Apply the Things Learned</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Moses, who was a man of faith and a doer of God’s will, said: “You must apply these words.” (Deut. 11: 18) Why such an exhortation? Israel was to obey Jehovah, to love him, and to serve him. (Deut. 11:8,13) It was not enough just to know the commandments. They needed to “apply these words.” Their doing so would result in many blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In our day, the Greater Moses, Jesus Christ, is directing spiritual Israel and the “great crowd” of faithful worshipers. We, too, need to apply the things we learn. Jesus said: “Everyone that hears these sayings of mine and does them will be likened to a discreet man.” (Matt. 7:24) We ‘hear’ these sayings by reading the Bible and the Society’s publications and by attending congregation meetings, circuit assemblies, and district conventions. Do we apply what we hear?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RECENT REMINDERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> During the last circuit assembly series, emphasis was placed on the need to seek God’s glory and to walk</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Parents—Train Your Children in the Field Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> How vital it is to give adequate care and attention to one’s family! Paul wrote Timothy: “Certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith.” (1 Tim. 5:8) In a spiritual way, one of the primary responsibilities of Christian parents is to study with and train their children. (Deut. 6:6, 7; Eph. 6:4; 1 Tim. 4:15, 16) Family training will result in more qualified ministers to spread the good news of the Kingdom.—2 Tim. 2:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Parents should regularly schedule time to work with their children in field service. This is not always easy. But we can all agree that spending time in the field ministry on a regular basis brings many rich blessings. Taking your children along regularly will help them to see the importance of field service. As they have a fuller share in the work and improve in their abilities and experience Jehovah’s blessings on their activity, their joy will increase.—Ps. 71:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> What can you do to help your children to appreciate and enjoy the field ministry? Show them how they can have a share. Prepare for the field service together. Youths decently in view of the hour. We were reminded that in contrast with the demoralizing world in which we live, we should hate the works belonging to darkness. Are you applying the counsel given relative to inappropriate videocassettes, books, magazines, and TV programs that can undermine your spirituality? What about the warning against questionable social gatherings and the immoderate use of alcohol? We were warned about the snare of greed as well as the dangers of blindly following modern fads that can pervert and corrupt. Appropriate admonition was given about our conduct at district conventions, including the need for adults and children alike to comport themselves well at hotels and motels and to pay close attention to the program, instead of carrying on conversations that may disturb others. Will you be remembering and applying this counsel?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> At circuit assemblies and our </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1}</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">appreciate the loving attention given, thus helping them advance through progressive training. Depending on their age, they can learn to be attentive at the doors or to give the householders an invitation or tract. As progress is made, train them to share in reading a scripture. Many young ones enjoy witnessing with the magazines. A simple magazine presentation can easily be learned. Parents can help their children to find good talking points in current magazines and to give effective presentations. Regular and progressive parental teaching and training produce positive results.—Eph. 4:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">VALUE OF EXAMPLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Children copy what they see. The Bible says: “One who is good will leave an inheritance to sons of sons.” (Prov. 13:22) Therefore, parents need to do their utmost to set the right example. Your attitude toward the service will greatly affect your children. Through conversation and regular participation in the preaching work, do you show your child how much you appreciate the field ministry? Do your conversation and attitude indicate that you view pioneering as a goal for</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">congregation meetings, we have been learning ways to increase our share in the field service and to improve our effectiveness as ministers of the good news. Our recent circuit assembly program highlighted the pioneer ministry. We were asked, “Can you make room for pioneering?” Have you been giving serious consideration to the pioneer service? Have you been encouraging others to pioneer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> In 1985, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font13">discussed many ways we could improve our ministry. Recommendations were made concerning ways to follow up the interest found, how to preach in business territory, how to offer subscriptions on return visits, or to keep on road leading to life. —Prov. 4:20-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">22 min: “Parents—Train Your Children in the Field Service.” Question-and-answer discussion handled by elder.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HELP YOUR FAMILY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> When Moses spoke to Israel, he said: “You must also teach them to your sons.” (Deut. 11:19) Have you parents been applying the things learned in connection with making disciples of your children? The July 1985 issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> asked: “Does your entire family share in the field service the first Sunday of each month? What about the goal of helping family members learn the current Topic for Conversation or a new magazine presentation?” Does your family do these things?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> There is no doubt that applying the things learned will bring countless blessings. Jesus said: “If you know these things, happy you are if you do them.”—John 13:17.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s Witnesses are looking forward with expectation to the 1986 “Divine Peace” District Conventions that are scheduled for this summer. A listing of 130 conventions in the United States was provided in the February 1, 1986, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font13"> All will want to make plans to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">-u - From ancient times, Jehovah’s servants have gathered at assemblies and conventions. For example, while the Israelites were in Egypt, Moses and Aaron assembled the older men so that special instruction could be given to them. (Ex. 4:27-31) Thereafter, as God ordered, the Israelites gathered at the base of Mount Sinai. On that occasion they witnessed the awesome demonstration of Jehovah’s power and received his commandments. (Ex. 19: 10-19) Later, when the temple was constructed, Solomon gathered the people together in Jerusalem in connection with the dedication of that building. The convention lasted for many days, and when the people returned home, they were “joyful and feeling good at heart over the goodness that Jehovah had performed toward David and toward Solomon and toward Israel his people.” (2 Chron. 5:1-7:10) The people regularly assembled in observance of the annual festivals, and as a result, they experienced many blessings.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Early Christians continued to follow this established pattern. On many occasions, large crowds gathered to listen to Jesus speak. Just imagine the blessings that were received by those who were privileged to be in attendance when Jesus delivered his Sermon on the Mount! (Matt. 5:1-7:29) After Jesus’ death, his followers continued to meet together, as on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E. when holy spirit was poured out. (Acts 2:1-4) The apostle Paul admonished: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.”—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> In recent times as well, conventions have a Special place in our theocratic arrangement. They vare not mere social occasions but are designed to instruct and unite Jehovah’s servants. All in attendance receive the same instruction at the same time. This promotes peace and unity. Jehovah’s Word is read and considered, with clear direction-given. Such gatherings result in many rich spiritual blessings and Eure occasions of great joy.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>ATTEND ALL SESSIONS</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The conventions scheduled for this summer will highlight the theme “Divine Peace.” Jehovah is the God of peace, and he has blessed his people with peace as well. (Ps. 29:11) A different aspect of this theme will be highlighted each day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Make every effort to attend all four days. The opening session will begin at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday. This will allow most of the brothers sufficient time to travel to the convention city on Thursday morning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> It is once again strongly recommended that you attend the convention to which your congregation is assigned, following the direction provided in the insert of the January 1986 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry. </span><span class="font13">It is appreciated, however, that there may be extenuating circumstances, such as prearranged vacation plans that cannot be adjusted or the need to assist relatives living in another area. In all cases, please cooperate closely with the direction given locally by your convention coordinator.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>BAPTISM ARRANGEMENTS</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> The baptism is always one of the highlights of a district convention. At most locations, the talk for baptismal candidates will be on Saturday morning. Those who are contemplating baptism should have reviewed the questions with the local elders, in line with the direction outlined in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font13"> book, pages 173-5. A modest bathing _suit and a towel should be brought by each one who arranges to be baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Please note that the Society would like all baptismal candidates to remain standing in the section reserved for them for the singing of the first three verses of the song selected to close the session that includes the baptism talk. The assigned attendants will assist the candidates to file out during the singing of the fourth verse. The audience should remain for the singing of the entire song so as to facilitate the exiting of the baptismal candidates. Your cooperation in following these instructions will be very much appreciated.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>BE A GOOD LISTENER</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> We will all want to be good listeners. In ancient Israel, the command was given: “Congregate the people, the men and the women and the little ones ..., in order that they may listen and in order that they may learn.” (Deyt^US) We meet together in order to be taught by Jehovah. Proverbs 1:^ states: “A wise person will listen and take in'mofe instruction.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> Excellent direction was provided in the February 1, 1986, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> page 30, regarding the need to listen carefully while in attendance at the convention. It stated in partk“Many of us will have come at considerable expense in time and funds. So let us see to it that we are punctual and in good physical condition. That means that we should not overindulge in food or drink nor keep late hours. Rather, let us make certain that we use moderation and get to bed on time so as to be refreshed and fit to take in all the spiritual food that is being provided. While the program is on, let us be in our seats listening, not wandering around or engaging in conversation. ... The time to talk to our friends is before and after the sessions. Yes, let us come fully determined to get really built up spiritually.”! Will we endeavor to apply this fine counsel?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> We are pleased that, for the most part, convention delegates do put forth a determined effort to listen closely to the program. Family groups are observed sitting together, taking meaningful notes, and following the reading of Scripture texts in their personal copies of the Bible. A newspaper reporter who was in attendance at one of our conventions in Nairobi, Kenya, made this observation: “They all seemed to be giving reverence to Jehovah. Everybody, including children, patiently listened to one speaker after the other. They sat from 1:30 to 5:10 p.m.” jOur brothers and sisters in Africa provide a fine example for us to follow. A newspaper in Argentina stated that “order, cleanliness, and markbd'silence” by those in attendance characterized the district convention held in Buenos Aires recently. Our brothers in that country especially appreciate the privilege of assembling together because our work there had been banned for many years.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> As stated earlier, we will not want to distract others by talking, moving about, or unnecessarily using the rest rooms while the program is in progress. One elder from the United States who attended j- a large convention last summer reported that at the ‘ beginning of each session he and his wife found it difficult to hear because of the movement, conversation, and looking for seats by latecomers. He stated that even during the remainder of the program there was constant movement and much talking in the stands and passageways.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>14</sup> Parents will want to assume the responsibility of properly supervising their families, seeing to it that their children listen and learn. It is suggested that family heads review with their households the direction provided in this insert before attending a convention. Thereafter, they will all want to apply the information personally. This will provide a good example for others, especially for families who may be newly associated with Jehovah’s Witnesses. At one convention a group of young sisters in their early teens were observed sitting together, apart from their parents. They did not listen to the program or even join in the songs and prayers. Rather, they talked with one another and ate snacks throughout the session, taking little interest in wfiat was being presented from the platform. Their conduct was very distracting to those around them. This illustrates the problems that can develop if parents are permissive and do not sit with or control their children.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>SAVING OF SEATS</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>15</sup> Some adjustments related to the saving of seats were made in the May 1985 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry. </span><span class="font13">The insert stated on page 5: “SEATS MAY BE SAVED ONLY FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ANY WHO MAY BE TRAVELING WITH YOU IN YOUR OWN CAR GROUP.” Please do not place articles in additional seats at any time. This will enable those searching for unoccupied seats to find them easily. It is appreciated that many endeavored to apply this direction. Likewise, this year we will want to be concerned not only with our own personal needs but also with the needs of others.—Gal. 6:10; 1 Cor. 13:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>16</sup> We regret that negative reports have still been received from the field. At one convention site, individuals reportedly dressed in bedroom attire entered an auditorium at approximately 4:30 a.m. on Sunday and placed towels, bed sheets, and electric extension cords on hundreds of seats. This was done despite the fact that there were more than enough seats available for all who would be in attendance. At still another convention site—one that made use of an outdoor stadium—a brother reported that some delegates were establishing territorial rights by placing canopies over blocks of seats. Many of these seats were not used. Some were occupied by lunch baskets and beverage coolers throughout the sessions. At the same time, many older persons were looking for seats and could not find them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>17</sup> Do not such accounts make us feel very sad? How did we and our family members conduct ourselves in this regard? Did we take the lead in demonstrating humility, fellow feeling, and compassion for others?—Luke 14:7-11; Phil. 2:3; 1 Pet. 3:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>DRESS AND GROOMING</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>18</sup> Regardless of the facility used, it becomes our “Kingdom Hall” during the convention, and so we should act and dress accordingly. Our brothers and sisters have done very well in this regard, and as a result, an excellent witness has been given. Note this positive experience from Canada. A sister was waiting to meet a relative en route to the convention. She noticed another woman standing near her, intently observing the conventioners on their way to the stadium. In time this woman turned to the sister and stated: “These people are so outstanding in the way that they dress to go to a convention. They are so nicely dressed, so neat and tidy. What is so amazing is the way that their young people look. Not a pair of jeans among them! It’s just amazing for young people.” An invitation to the convention was readily accepted by this individual. She was impressed by what she saw.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>19</sup> Our dress should be not only modest and in good taste but practical for the occasion as well. For example, if the convention facility is airconditioned, it may be best to bring a coat or a sweater. If a stadium or other outside facility is used, it would be good to wear long-sleeved clothing, hats, and so forth, to offer protection from the sun and weather. Raincoats and umbrellas are helpful in the event of rain. Advance planning is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>20</sup> What about our personal appearance while at our places of accommodation or while traveling in the convention city? One traveling overseer noted that when some of the brothers got back to their rooming accommodations, they quickly changed into clothes that made them appear as if they were on a camping trip or picnic. Some even wore immodest and faddish outfits that made them hard to recognize as Jehovah’s Witnesses. We will want to be discreet so as not to give any cause for stumbling. —2 Cor. 6:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>CONDUCT IN CONVENTION CITY</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>21</sup> All of us should be alert to maintain a high standard of Christian conduct when staying at motels and hotels while in the convention city. Rather than being in a socially festive mood, we ought to demonstrate a spiritual frame of mind and conduct ourselves as ministers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>22</sup> Some problems have been reported. A number of teenage Witnesses staying at one motel spent much time on the tennis court, on walkways, and in break-dancing to the accompaniment of loud music. A sister who is employed at another motel reported that she was embarrassed because of the questionable conduct of some of Jehovah’s Witnesses who stayed there. There appeared to be an excessive amount of drinking, and some rooms were left in a very unclean condition. A bad impression was left with the management. While these may be isolated incidents, it helps all of us to see the need to be careful about our personal conduct and the impression we give to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>23</sup> It must also be remembered that as Christians we must conduct ourselves honestly at all times. We should not want to take linen or other “souvenirs” from motels, as this is stealing; nor should we be untruthful in reporting how many persons we plan to have in a room when making reservations. Faithfulness to Jehovah’s righteous standards, even in little things, will result in a good witness.—Luke 16:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>24</sup> While away from home, we may eat in restaurants or be provided with services by hotel or motel personnel. The inserts of the May 1981 and 1980 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font13"> provided good direction on the matter of tipping. While fast-food eating establishments do not provide waiter service and so no tipping is expected, it is usually the local custom when eating in restaurants to leave a generous and appropriate tip for waiter services. (Prov. 11:25) Individual tipping may be the major source of income for the person rendering personal services. If you are not sure as to what is expected in this regard, you could inquire. We do not want to take such things for granted or demonstrate thoughtlessness that could reflect unfavorably upon Jehovah’s name people.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>FIELD SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>25</sup> People living in convention cities are usually made aware of our conventions by the news media. Their interest is often aroused, and they have many questions. We are thus often able to give a witness not only by our fine conduct but also by speaking with the people directly. Look for opportunities to witness informally while shopping, traveling to and from the convention site, and so forth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>26</sup> In addition, arrangements will once again be made at each convention for field service on Friday, following the conclusion of the afternoon session at 3:00 p.m. This will give all of us the opportunity to participate in the service for an hour or two. Please bring a supply of current magazines with you for this activity. It is also suggested that you obtain territory and make up your car groups in advance, if possible. Doing so will enhance your appreciation of the convention.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>VOLUNTEER SERVICE</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>27</sup> Much work is required to operate a convention and to care for the needs of those in attendance. Many volunteer workers are needed. Your congregation’s convention coordinator will receive information listing departments in need of volunteers, and he will make this known to the congregation. You can arrange through him to volunteer your services. Children under 16 years of age who work must do so with a parent or another adult at all times. We encourage parents and their children to volunteer and work together if that is possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>28</sup> There will be need for some last-minute volunteers. If you want to assist, please go to the Volunteer Service desk when you arrive at the convention. Your willing service will be very much appreciated and will help toward the operation of a successful convention.—Ps. 110:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>FOOD NEEDS</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>29</sup> Once again special arrangements are being made to care for our physical needs. Provisions for food and drink will be similar to what has been available at district conventions in recent years. Do we not appreciate the hard work of the brothers in the Food Service Department as they provide us with adequate food at a reasonable cost?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>30</sup> Convention tickets to purchase food and drink will be available at the cost of $1.00 per sheet of ten. It is suggested that you purchase these in advance through your congregation. Purchase enough tickets to supply your family’s food needs for the first two or three days of the convention. You may obtain additional tickets at the convention itself.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>31</sup> May we and our families resolve to attend all sessions of the 1986 “Divine Peace” District Convention and concentrate on the program. We will not be disappointed. In addition, be conscious of the needs of our brothers and sisters, doing what we can to demonstrate thoughtfulness and Christian love. (Gal. 6:10) In a world filled with strife and violence, what a grand privilege we have to worship the God of peace and to be able to assemble peacefully with our brothers and sisters. May we continue to “observe the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace.”—Eph. 4:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">District Convention Reminders</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ROOMING: </span><span class="font13">Your cooperation in using the listing of accommodations provided by the convention in selecting your rooms is very much appreciated. If you have not already confirmed a reservation, it is necessary to do so immediately if you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city. If you find it necessary to cancel your accommodations selected from the listing, you should write or phone the hotel/motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. If you have made duplicate reservations with the idea of selecting preferred rooms upon arrival, please cancel them immediately. Making duplicate reservations and failing to cancel reservations that will not be used damages our reputation and relationship with motel managers who are giving us special rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Congregation convention coordinators should be sure that Special Needs Room Request forms have been promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should notify both the landlord or hotel/ motel and the convention Rooming Department so that the room may be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The convention Rooming Department will provide, upon your request, available information on any commercial trailer or camping facilities in the convention area. Please include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">BABY STROLLERS: </span><span class="font13">In many states, baby strollers may not be used in places of public assembly. Fire regulations prohibit parking them in corridors, aisles, or between rows of seats. Since larger crowds may cause congested conditions, baby strollers are potentially dangerous not only to the baby but also to any who may stumble over them. However, car or infant seats are permissible, since these can be secured in seats next to the parents. Your cooperation in this matter will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font13">It is the course of wisdom and shows appreciation to be in our seats when the program begins. That will be 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, 9:20 a.m. on Friday, and 9:30 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday at most conventions. The same fine qualities are displayed when we do not plan to leave before the sessions conclude. The closing song and prayer will be at 5:10 p.m. on Thursday. Friday afternoon will be set aside for a special effort in field service, following the closing song and prayer at 3:00 p.m. On Saturday the closing song and prayer will be at 5:00 p.m. and on Sunday at 4:00 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">BETHEL AND GILEAD MEETINGS: </span><span class="font13">A meeting will be held on Friday for pioneers between the ages of 20 and 40 who are interested in attending Gilead School to receive training for missionary service. There will be a meeting on Saturday for any dedicated publishers between 19 and 35 years of age who are U.S. residents and who would like to enter Bethel service. Check the program at the convention city for the exact times and locations of these meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font13">All </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">special </span><span class="font13">pioneers as well as traveling overseers will need to bring their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card (S-202) to the convention. Those on the list for six months at the time of the district convention they attend may receive $18 worth of convention tickets upon presentation of their Watchtower ID card at that one convention only. Treat the card as carefully as cash. It cannot be replaced at the convention. Any gift releases or other literature at pioneer rates will be available to pioneers at the bookroom only, upon showing their Watchtower ID card. Those in Bethel service may obtain these same provisions by showing their Bethel ID card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">LAPEL CARDS: </span><span class="font13">These cards are provided as a means of advertising the convention as well as to facilitate identifying our brothers and sisters in attendance. To this end, please </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">wear</span><span class="font13"> the specially designed lapel card at the convention and also while traveling to and from the convention site. Not only is the card a means of identification but it so often results in giving a fine witness while traveling. You should obtain these through your congregation as they will </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font13"> be available at the conventions. The lapel cards are two cents each. (Lapel cards have already been consigned to each congregation by the Society, but the plastic holders must be ordered by the congregation.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A WORD OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font13">Regardless of where you park, you should lock your vehicle at </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font13"> times and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font13"> leave anything visible inside. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk, if possible. Also, guard against thieves and pickpockets who are attracted by large gatherings. This includes not leaving anything of value unattended on seats at the conventions. Additionally, it has been reported that there is a greater risk of falls on stairs and ramps when sisters wear high-heeled shoes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">• How can we help our Bible students to qualify for baptism as disciples of Jesus Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This can most effectively be done by (1) conducting a regular and progressive home Bible study, (2) encouraging regular attendance and participation at the five weekly congregation meetings, and (3) as soon as they become Scripturally qualified, helping and training them to have a meaningful share in the field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Jesus Christ commissioned his followers to make disciples, to baptize them, and to teach them to observe his commandments. That commission remains in effect to this day, as indicated by the words: “And, look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A disciple is one who accepts and actively promotes the teachings of another. Therefore, those being baptized not only must have gained a basic knowledge of Bible truth but should already be demonstrating by</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Effective Meetings for Field Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Zeal for field service has noticeably increased in the past few years. In part, this may be due to better education of God’s people in how to present the good news to others effectively. Instructive meetings for field service play an important part in this educational process.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> These meetings should prepare the minds and hearts of the brothers and sisters for the work they will be doing. Those participating in field service appreciate meetings that highlight good practical points and suggestions that will help them to be effective in their preaching activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> In order to benefit those attending, the one assigned to conduct the meeting should think in advance of what he will do to make it both interesting and instructive. The daily text can be discussed, especially if it is appropriate for field service. Points from Meetings for Field Service should be used. There may be times when it would be appropriate to consider portions from </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures.</span><span class="font13"> As a result, those attending should feel better equipped to carry on their</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Improving the Quality of Our Meetings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The October 1985 issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> featured the article “Manifesting Spiritual Growth by Participating in Meetings.” Have you followed the suggestions given? If so, your comments at the meetings have probably been more to the point and more beneficial to you and to others. At this time, we want to address the matter of improving the quality of our meetings and point out the benefits we can derive through personal preparation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Let us illustrate it this way. If you were planning to visit the Bible lands, your anticipation would be greatly heightened if you first studied information about these lands sind their history as presented in the Bible and in references such as the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Aid</span><span class="font13"> book. If you were to make no advance preparation, there would be less eagerness on your part to see specific places of interest. The same is true with regard to attending congregation meetings. By taking time to review what is to be discussed at the meetings, we whet our spiritual appetite and become more eager to have a share in commenting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Demands on our time are becoming greater with each passing year. How do we find the needed time to ministry. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The meeting for field service should be brief, limited to no more than 15 minutes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> How can you help to make meetings for service beneficial? By reviewing the material in advance and thinking about points that would be helpful to others. If you have good success in applying the suggestions being discussed, you may have helpful comments that can be made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Before concluding with prayer, generally the one conducting should check to make sure that those in the group know with whom they will go and where they will be working. Sufficient territory should be assigned so that all will be able to keep busy for the full time they are in the field ministry. After the prayer, all should proceed to the territory, thus making the best use of time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Well-planned meetings for service can greatly help us to get organized and to present the message more effectively. Many report that they share more zealously in the ministry and stay out longer as a result of being properly instructed at the meetings for field service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">study? We have to buy out time from nonessential activities. (Eph. 5:16) By far the majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses are in attendance at all five weekly meetings, and for many it is with no small effort that they are present. In order to derive the greatest benefit from the time and effort spent in getting to the meetings, we need to spend some time on advance preparation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> When commenting, be conscious of such essentials as accuracy, brevity, and clarity. Advance preparation will help. Upon receiving a new issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font13"> read it through. Later, in preparation for the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> Study, underline only key words and phrases. (Please see </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook,</span><span class="font13"> page 36.) This will enable us to give comments that are brief and to the point.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> With more volunteering to comment, greater enthusiasm will be in evidence. This should stimulate shy ones to participate, giving a wider range of upbuilding comments. If we apply these suggestions, our joy will increase and the quality of the meetings will improve as we make “public declaration,” or “confession,” of our faith.—Heb. 10:23, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Rbi8</span><span class="font13"> footnote.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In Rural Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Although preaching the good news in rural territories offers challenges that are not generally present when working in metropolitan areas, it can bring rewarding experiences. Many people who live in isolated areas are responding favorably to the good news of the Kingdom, and we want to do all that we can to help them.—Compare Isaiah 42:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ADVANCE PLANNING NECESSARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In order to cover rural territory thoroughly, advance planning is needed, especially on the part of the elders. They will consider whether the size of car groups of publishers should be limited so that all can keep busy and the most can be accomplished. In some rural areas, houses are close together; in other sections they are farther apart. These factors should be considered when car groups are arranged. Sometimes publishers can be dropped off and later picked up by the car driver. However, good judgment should be shown.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Weather and road conditions must also be taken into consideration when working rural areas. In some territories rain, mud, snow, or icy conditions may make it difficult to travel at times. Elders may make arrangements to concentrate on working certain territories during summer months.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COOPERATION NEEDED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Working rural territories re</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font13">quires cooperation and consideration on the part of all. Sometimes, when extensive driving is necessary, those traveling in car groups can assist with automobile expenses. Additionally, good judgment should be exercised when publishers are invited into homes. Others waiting in the car will want to be patient. On the other hand, the publisher who is at the house will not want to spend an excessive amount of time talking with the householder but be conscious that others are waiting. Arrangements can be made for a return visit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Plan to spend long days working in distant rural territory. This may be done especially during summer months when days are longer so that more can be accomplished. Publishers can arrange to take their lunch, as well as a sufficient supply of literature.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> If rural territory is not worked frequently, it may be appropriate to leave a back issue of a magazine or a tract at not-at-homes. Some individuals have read such literature with interest upon returning home and have learned the truth. Keep an accurate record of interest found, and strive to call back at a later date. Effectively working rural territory presents challenges and may call for sacrifices. However, the results can be most rewarding.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> May Jehovah continue to bless the efforts of his people as we “declare abroad the kingdom of God” in rural territories.—Luke 9:60.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Many young ones who have not as yet been baptized are sharing in the field service. We are pleased to have them with us. (Matt. 19:13-15) It may be that they are too young to understand fully what dedication means. But time does not stand still. So parents should be helping their children to see the need to progress and, in due course, to take the steps of dedication and baptism. Are your children responding to the discipline and mentalregulating of Jehovah? Are they applying what they are learning in the home and in the congregation? It is our hope that our young publishers will make continued progress and grow in their love for Jehovah and in their desire to serve him.</span></p>

Additionally, as disciples of Jesus Christ, they recognize Jehovah’s visible organization and the authority of Jesus Christ as exercised through “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Matt. 24:45-47; Acts 1:8) Sensing the urgency of our times, they have aligned themselves with Jehovah’s people in doing the work Jesus initiated and assigned to his followers. (Luke 8:1; Matt. 24:14) Water baptism for these disciples serves as an outward symbol of their whole-souled dedication to Jehovah God.—Compare Psalm 40:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is good to keep in mind that we are helping Bible students to become disciples of Jesus Christ and not disciples of ourselves. If, because of personal circumstances, available time, natural abilities, or other valid considerations, it should become apparent that we are not able to help the Bible student to make the needed progress toward discipleship, we should talk with the elders about the matter. They may be able to make practical suggestions contributing to the spiritual development of the student, in harmony with the apostle Paul’s words at 1 Corinthians 3:5-9.</span></p>

If either or both of these books are not available in the language of the student, other comparable Society publications that set forth basic Bible teachings and explain Jehovah’s righteous requirements for mankind can be used.</span></p>

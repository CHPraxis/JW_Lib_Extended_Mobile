<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Progressive in Your Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Growth and progress are desirable qualities to observe and experience. The farmer anxiously watches seedlings grow into fruit-producing plants. Parents take delight in seeing their children develop into responsible adults. In like manner, Jehovah is keenly interested in seeing us make spiritual progress in our ministry. His Word encourages us to make our advancement manifest, that is, observable.—1 Tim. 4: 15,16; Phil. 3:13, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Paul’s letter to the Hebrews indicates that some had failed to be progressive in their ministry. He likened them to babes; before they could make progress as teachers of God’s Word, someone had to teach them the fundamentals. (Heb. 5: 12-14) Does not their experience and the counsel they received emphasize that we ought to see progress in our Christian course? How can we work toward improving the quality of our field ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">IMPROVING OUR PRESENTATIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Possibly your first experience in field service was accompanied by nervousness and feelings of inadequacy. You may have memorized a presentation and used it over and over until you felt more comfortable at the doors. As we increase in knowledge, however, our presentations should become more flexible,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Active in Preaching During Summer Months</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many good things we enjoy are associated with Jehovah’s gift of summertime. (Jas. 1:17) Are we resolved to use this summer to his praise? Of course, our theocratic activities should remain in first place during all seasons of the year. Surely we will have this in mind as we plan our summer activities.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">USING EVERY OPPORTUNITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Many of us have had faithstrengthening experiences as a result of keeping active in preaching while on vacation. Tactfully initiating informal conversations with others in restaurants and motels or while traveling brings many blessings to brothers who take this initiative in speaking to others about the good news. While traveling, a brother spoke to a young man who was reading a book on politics and sparked his interest in the Kingdom hope. The young man obtained literenabling us to speak with greater confidence on a variety of Bible topics. How are you progressing in this regard? Are you still expressing yourself at the doors as you did when you started publishing? Or have you made advancement in your door-to-door presentations?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many of Jehovah’s Witnesses who began publishing at an early age were taught a brief magazine presentation by their parents. In the course of time, these have progressed to using the current Topic for Conversation with the regular literature offer. Parents, we encourage you to help your children to improve their presentations as they grow physically and spiritually.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Of vital importance to our being progressive in the ministry is the training offered at congregation meetings. Do we pay close attention at the Service Meeting? There we receive current instruction that can help us to meet effectively the challenges we face in our ministry. Are we taking advantage of this excellent provision? Our presentations will be greatly improved if we take all this valuable training to heart and put it to use.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">USING THE </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">LIVE FOREVER</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> BOOK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book is a remarkable teaching aid, a timely </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1) </span><span class="font12">ature from the Society, and within a few months, he was moved to resign from his church and began teaching others what he had learned.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Advance preparation is necessary if you are to get the best results. Be sure to have your Bible and a supply of literature with you. Plan on attending meetings and working in field service with the local congregation where you visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The upcoming “Divine Peace” District Conventions will provide excellent opportunities to preach while traveling. Wearing our lapel cards often arouses the curiosity of others, affording us the opportunity of starting conversations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPORTUNITIES TO PIONEER</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> During school vacation periods, young dedicated publishers who qualify can auxiliary pioneer. In </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font12"> 4, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Meetings to Help Us Make Disciples</span></h1>
<p><span class="font12">NOTE: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the district convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. Review may be divided into three 10-minute portions. Following brief introduction, chairman could review Thursday and Friday program highlights. Second brother would review Saturday program, and third brother would focus attention on Sunday highlights. Any experiences used or occasional comments from audience should be brief and to the point. A well-prepared review will help the brothers to remember key points for personal application and use in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 148</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Local announcements and Announcements from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font12"> The June 22 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> has two helpful articles on tipping. Brothers are encouraged to read these articles before going to convention cities or visiting other places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: “Be Progressive in Your Ministry.” Question-and-answer discussion of article. Read paragraphs and cited scriptures as time permits. Present one or two well-prepared, pointed demonstrations showing how to offer the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book in local territory. Note use of Romans 16:20 as second scripture in Topic for Conversation. Adapt material to local needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Family Preparation for Field Service. Family-group discussion. Family head takes lead in discussion with wife and children, including one preteen child and one in late teens. Father cadis attention to information on page 11 in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book under “FAMILY/CHILDREN.” Suggests that these introductions will blend in very nicely with current Topic for Conversation. Wife can express agreement. Is asked how she plans to use these introductions along with topic and offer of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font12">book. She believes this presentation will be effective in local territory where there are many families with young children. She enjoys having one of the children accompany her from house to house and read one of the scriptures to be used. Father asks older son or daughter how this material could be used effectively by young person in house-to-house ministry. After greeting householder, young one may inquire whether there are children in the family and ask householder what he thinks future holds for his children or for other young ones today. Young publisher could then state that although many young people are discouraged because of what the future seems to hold for them, he is optimistic because of what his parents have helped him to learn from the Bible. This would lead into the current topic. Preteen child could then be helped with preparation of brief presentation to be used in offering the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book or current magazines, or shown how to offer a tract or an invitation when working with parent. Chairman should encourage parents to take time to help family members prepare for meaningful house-to-house service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">provision from Jehovah’s progressive organization. During the months of June and July we can have a full share in the distribution of this excellent publication. However, as progressive ministers, we want to do more than merely place books. A careful record of all placements should be kept. Why? Because in placing the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font12">book, we are providing the householder with a principal textbook for Bible study. Our ultimate goal is to make disciples, so a conscientious effort should be made to return within the week, if possible, to develop the interest even further.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Progressive ministers learn to take advantage of every opportunity to offer a Bible study. Some publishers are able to start studies on the first call. When directing the householder’s attention to the book, use paragraphs that you have selected in advance. These should be directly related to the subject under discussion and have questions that are likely to arouse interest. Publishers who carefully prepare to do this are more successful in starting studies than are those who show the householder portions of the book at random.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> We have come to be part of Jehovah’s progressive organization, and Jehovah lovingly assists us to keep pace with it. Let us all respond to that help by being progressive in our ministry. By taking advantage of the abundant direction and training he provides, “let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ.”—Eph. 4:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Keep Faith Strong Th</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Study of the Bible is to spiritual health and strong faith what proper diet is to physical well-being. You cannot be strong spiritually without regular personal study of the Bible. Furthermore, good study habits enable us to maintain strong faith and thus ward off successfully Satan’s fiery darts of persecution, materialism, and temptations to do what is bad.—Eph. 6:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BENEFITS OF PERSONAL STUDY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Personal study enriches our understanding of the Scriptures. It helps us to build a strong faith and to grasp the breadth and length and height and depth of the love of the Christ. (Rom. 11:33; Eph. 3:16-19) As a fruit of the spirit, faith becomes a motivating force in our lives. We are helped to put on the new personality and to conduct ourselves as spiritual persons. (Gal. 5: 22, 23; Eph. 4:24) We arc better equipped to deal with personal problems. We are enabled to overlook the shortcomings of others and to promote peace and unity in the congregation. (Col. 3:10, 13, 14) All of this can be refreshing to us and to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Personal study also better equips us to help interested persons we contact in the field ministry. Confidently we will be able to ‘make a defense before everyone that demands of us a reason for the hope in us.’ (1 Pet. 3:15) Like our Exemplar, Christ Jesus, we can speak as one having authority, accurately knowing Jehovah’s will and able to point out clearly and logically what the Scriptures teach.—Matt. 7: 28, 29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW AND WHEN TO STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■* Our aim should be to do more than just read over study material. It takes time to reflect on what we read. Ask yourself: How does the material apply to me? What does it reveal about Jehovah, his qualities, and his ways? How might I use this information to help others? How does it relate to what I already know about the subject? By doing research to answer questions raised, we will gain a broadened understanding of the study material and see how it fits into the overall pattern of truth. This is how understanding is acquired.—Prov. 4:5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Developing a good study routine requires setting aside and holding to specific times for study. (Compare Philippians 3:16.) Some may find this difficult to do, but it becomes easier with time and effort.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Personal Study</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">And how rewarding! Perhaps you could study before retiring at night. Some prefer rising a little earlier in the morning to make use of this period of quietude. Lunch breaks from secular work can be used. Whenever the time, seek out the environment most conducive to study. This will enable you to concentrate and will contribute to retention. The heart can thus be motivated in the way of righteousness. —Prov. 15:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT TO STUDY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Preparation for our five weekly meetings should occupy a prominent place in our personal study program. In addition to preparing for the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> Study and Congregation Book Study, are you benefiting fully from the rich spiritual food outlined for the Theocratic Ministry School? Be sure to keep up with the scheduled Bible reading and take time to research Bible highlights in the Society’s publications. If you review ahead of time the material of talks 1, 3, and 4, you will find the presentations in the school more interesting. Important Bible instruction will be more deeply impressed on your mind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Preparing for the Service Meeting does not require a major portion of our personal study time, but this, too, should be included in our schedule. If you use just a few minutes each week to go over the program that is outlined in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> this will help keep your faith strong and help you to express your faith to others in the field ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> A balanced program for personal study will help toward your being “made mighty in the man you are inside.” (Eph. 3:16) Yes, a strong faith, deepened love for Jehovah and Christ Jesus, broader knowledge, and greater effectiveness in the ministry—all these benefits and more—make personal study worthwhile. Do you have a good program for personal study?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> As Christians we are all encouraged to make disciples. (Matt. 28: 19) In addition to those who accept Bible literature, others may be interested in the good news.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Newly Dedicated Ones Baptized: 2,752</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Our March report is outstanding. We all rejoice in the new peak of 723,881 publishers. For this service year, we had our sixth peak in regular pioneers. The 62,558 auxiliary pioneers is the highest for any month of March thus far, surpassing the fine number reporting in March 1985 by 17,227. There was also a new peak in return visits. And, for the first time, we passed the half-million mark in home Bible studies, the actual number being 513,179, a new peak. What a tremendous witness to Jehovah’s praise! In thankfulness to Jehovah, our desire is to praise him more fully.—Ps. 100:1-5.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “No man that has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well fitted for the kingdom of God.” This was Jesus’ reply to one who wanted to beg off from following him. (Luke 9:59-62) But how have Jehovah’s people today responded to the invitation to follow Jesus?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The 1986 service year began with a new peak of regular pioneers. Since then we have had a new peak almost every month, bringing the total number to well over 45,000! We also rejoiced to see a fine response to auxiliary pioneer service in the spring. Congregation publishers averaged over ten hours in March—their highest hour average since 1976! The total number of publishers in the United States reached a new peak of 725,799 in April. Another highlight during the year was the Memorial celebration on March 24, with an attendance of 1,691,297 here in the United States alone. Such increases made it necessary to form 195 new congregations during the first ten months of the service year.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Assist Newer Publishers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people are increasing worldwide. From 1984 to 1985 we had 184,909 more publishers in the ministry. Country after country continues reporting new peaks. Many people are making progress in the truth. Who can help all these new ones to advance to Christian maturity?—Heb. 6:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In order to help others, we ourselves must be mature. We should “reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah.” (2 Cor. 3:18) We do this in the way we live and by the manner we convey to others the truths we have learned about Jehovah’s purposes. So we need to be qualified ministers.—2 Cor. 3:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ARE YOU PREPARED TO ASSIST?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Do you have good study habits that can provide you with knowledge to share with others? Preparing for the meetings also helps to equip you for this fine work. At times all of us appreciate help from others. When Jesus sent his disciples out by twos, they were able to encourage and assist one another in working their territory and speaking to people.—Luke 10:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> New publishers appreciate kindly assistance. Just knowing that someone is at their side to assist</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PERSONAL GOALS FOR THE FUTURE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Our Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work is accelerating toward its conclusion. Soon it will be accomplished, &quot;and then the end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) Will we be among those feeling satisfied, knowing we did our utmost in Jehovah’s service? (Compare 2 Peter 3:11, 14.) Having personal service goals will help us to share fully in declaring abroad the Kingdom good news. Wliat can we do individually to increase and refine our sacrifice of praise to Jehovah?—Heb. 13:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> For some, it could mean participating regularly in field service on the first Sunday of every month. Once that goal has been accomplished, we may also find that we are able to schedule service regularly at other times during the month. If up until now we have been spending only a few hours in the ministry each month, could we perhaps set a personal goal to increase our time in the field to ten or more hours? It may be </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font11"> 2) them, if necessary, in the conversation gives them confidence. Usually, the person who studied with a new one helps him to get started in the field ministry. Children should receive training from their parents. But others can help; in fact, the Scriptures encourage us to help one another. (Prov. 27:17; Gal. 6:6) Perhaps you know someone in your Congregation Book Study group who would be happy to have an invitation to go with you in the service from time to time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> With a view to assisting others in the congregation, Paul instructed Titus to “keep on speaking what things are fitting.” Following through on this counsel, he then explained the role of both “the aged men” and “the aged women” in building up the congregation. (Titus 2:1-4) New and younger ones are particularly in need of assistance in molding their lives so as to be pleasing to God. As they are built up, they will qualify to instruct others in the truth. Today, as in the first century, mature brothers and sisters alike should take seriously their Scriptural roles to be examples and to assist </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page If, col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">A. 15 min: Question Box. Discussion to be handled by one on Congregation Service Committee. Emphasize that baptismal candidate must be an approved associate, a person who is ready to make a dedication to Jehovah or has already done so. Best for candidate not to wait until just before an assembly before expressing his desire to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">$ Song 202 and concluding prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">f 10 min: Local announcements and J accounts report. How are arrangements for field service being supported? Relate experiences to show benefits of such support. Encourage all to share in the magazine work this Saturday and suggest talking points for presenting current magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">“Assist Newer Publishers.” Talk and audience discussion. Encourage qualified brothers and sisters to arrange to work with different newer ones to help them become more effective in field service.</span></p>

Talk with demonstrations. Many </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font11"> books placed in the field. Are we prepared to follow up interest so it does not wither and die? Have two publishers discuss use of material under “Evolution” in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book, starting on page 121. Note especially two points of view as expressed on pages 126 and 127, one expressing belief in evolution and the other acknowledging the existence of a Creator. Show how we can use this information in house-to-house ministry or on return visits. Chairman refers to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font11"> book, highlights fine material that not only refutes evolution but builds faith. What subject would interest householder? The book is designed with questions to be studied. Chapter 3 deals with familiar material from Genesis. Or perhaps material in chapters 16 and 17 on “Why Would God Permit Suffering?” and “Can You Trust the Bible?” would appeal to householder. If time permits, two publishers can demonstrate starting study by using this fine publication. c. <sub>(l</sub>;</span></p>

Five-minute talk should make clear the difference between the claim of fundamentalists that the six creative days were each 24 hours long and the Bible teaching of creation. When offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font11"> book, we need to be prepared to expose the false viewpoint of fundamentalists as well as the evolution theory. Demonstrate publisher talking to person who does not believe in evolution but thinks the creation took place in six 24-hour days.

By Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font11"> Our use of this book has brought Jehovah’s name and purpose to the fore, as the following experience shows. In a southern state a publisher took the initiative to visit seven high schools in one district, informing them of the value of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font11"> book. At every school the principal felt that the students and faculty should know about the book. Five of the high help householder reason on the matter and see how such teaching has been a stumbling block to people who have some knowledge of the material universe. Householder responds favorably, accepts offer of book, and invites publisher back for return visit. Chairman concludes with encouragement for all to become acquainted with facts in the Society’s publications on the Bible teaching of creation. <sub>to</sub></span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “Praise Jehovah ... , you young men and also you virgins, you old men together with boys.” (Ps. 148: 7, 12) Young people can bring praise to Jehovah by making the truth their own. This means applying Christian principles in their lives, participating in congregation meetings, and having a full share in field service. They should come to do these things because they want to, not just because their parents or friends expect it of them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Choosing the Christian way of life starts with taking in knowledge of God. This can lead to a personal relationship with Jehovah. (Ps. 71:5) When a person dedicates himself to God to serve him for the rest of his life and is baptized, a friendship with God is established. Such a friendship with God, where young ones are concerned, enables them to “flee from the desires incidental to youth,” avoiding unnecessary worldly associations and attitudes. (2 Tim. 2:22) Setting theocratic goals, such as pioneering, Bethel, or missionary service, and then working toward them will strengthen young and old, drawing them closer to Jehovah.—Prov. 16:3.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah also uses young people to have the good news preached. (Matt 21:16) Many have found that by sharing in preaching activity on a weekly basis, they have come to enjoy it more and more. Some take advantage dFtheir opportunities at school to speak about Jehovah’s purposes. (Ps. 71:17; 145:21) Certainly such activity makes the heart of Jehovah glad.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> You young people, like others in the Christian congregation, be progressive in your spiritual development. By applying yourselves constantly to improve your theocratic activity, you make the truth your own. Thus you can be assured of Jehovah’s blessing.—Phil. 3:16; 2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">• When is a person eligible to receive his own copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> and how and when should the elders make arrangements for reviewing the questions with those desiring to be baptized?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Information on this subject is given on pages 173-5 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font11"> book, under “Note to Congregation Elders.” There it is explained that when a person has conformed his life to Jehovah’s righteous standards, is a regular meeting attender, and is having a meaningful share in the field service as an approved associate, he may express to one of the elders his desire to be baptized and at that time receive a personal copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry.—</span><span class="font11">See also pages 97-100 regarding “approved associate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Upon receiving the book, the approved associate should begin reviewing the questions for baptismal candidates starting on page 175.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">As a Family</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> One of the finest qualities that a parent can implant in his child is the desire to share the Kingdom good news with others. Because of the imperfect inclination of mind and heart from birth onward, children must be taught what is expected of them in order to please God. (Ps. 71:17) Actually, all of us must be taught to ‘seek first the Kingdom’ because, left to ourselves, we invariably seek first our own personal desires.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah commanded the Israelites to teach their children his laws and commandments. (Deut. 6:6-9) That same instruction is appropriate for families today in their rendering of sacred service to God. Are you helping to mold the hearts of your children so that they love Jehovah and find delight in sharing in his service? Do you take your children with you in the field service?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">EXAMPLES TO COPY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The Bible presents excellent examples of youths who became involved in sacred service at a very early age. Samuel started temple service right after being weaned by his mother, his age then being comparable to preschool age today. (1 Sam. 3:1, 15) Jephthah’s young unmarried daughter took up sacred service at the tabernacle in compliance with her father’s vow. (Judg. 11:36-40) Timothy had a fine reputation as a zealous Christian youth. (Acts 16:2) Philip the evangelizer had four daughters who prophesied, indicating that he took the lead in helping his family to serve Jehovah. Do the members of your family make an effort to help one another to serve in the field as disciples of Christ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Parents should arrange for their children to accompany them in the field ministry from a very early age. This is a part of parental responsibility. The father or mother, or both where possible, should regularly train their children in the field service. Setting a good example is one of the finest ways to encourage right goals and cultivate good motives in children. (Prov. 22:6) The Bible says: “One who is good will leave an inheritance to sons of sons.” (Prov. 13:22) Thus, much depends on setting the right example, for certainly we would not want our children to be following a wrong one. Since godly parents are the prime example a youngster imitates, children can be motivated to put Kingdom interests first if the parents take the field ministry seriously and do as much as they reasonably can in the preaching activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Often even very young ones can give householders a handbill or a tract. They can have a share in the preaching work by perhaps inviting people to the Kingdom Hall, letting them know they are welcome. Many young ones enjoy witnessing with the magazines. They prepare a brief presentation of the latest issues. At the doors, parents could mention that their child is being trained in the ministry and enjoys going along with them. A young publisher could be invited to keep the house-to-house records or read scriptures at the door. He may even be able to comment on the Bible verse being used in the current Topic for Conversation or answer a question or two that the parent might ask in order to isolate a main point. Some children, even at a very young age, can give a fine Scriptural presentation at the doors because of the excellent training their parents have given them. As you can appreciate, having a part makes the work much more enjoyable for our young people. Householders are often prompted to comment on how well such young ones express themselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Are you taking time to teach your children by working with them in the field service? Are you young publishers appreciating the help you get and showing a willingness to accompany your parents or others in the field service? You can be sure that Jehovah is pleased with you when you do. It is gratifying to see our children apply the things we teach them.—Prov. 23: 15, 24.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Parents can do much to help their children make progress. Helping them with their first student talks and then seeing them develop their own talks and gain ability to comment freely from the heart and with understanding is truly a satisfying experience. Are you aiding your children in this way? Could they make more progress if you worked with them consistently</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">presiding overseer makes arrangements for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Preparation for baptism should not be rushed. Therefore, the individual should inform the elders well in advance of the time he plans to get baptized. It is not necessary for the elders to wait until an assembly has been announced before going over the questions with those who are preparing for baptism. Those conducting Bible studies should be alert to the spiritual progress of their students, discern when they are approaching dedication, and let them know how to make arrangements for baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Elders reviewing the questions with a person desiring to be baptized may decide that it would be advisable for him to make further spiritual advancement before taking this important step. Perhaps he needs to take in more knowledge or become more adept at expressing his faith to others. (1 Pet. 3:15) It may be that he should gain additional experience in the field ministry. Or it could be found that he really does not yet qualify for baptism. (See Acts 8:36.) In each case, the elders should outline what further progress is needed and, if necessary, arrange for whatever personal assistance may be required to help the person to qualify later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">with those goals in mind? Think of the joy you would have seeing sons and daughters progress in appreciation of the truth and in zeal and ability to share the good news with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> All in the congregation of Jehovah’s people should cooperate with a view to the advancement of each member in the ministry. Some are qualified to be teachers, while others can help in different ways. (Compare 1 Corinthians 12:27, 28.) Perhaps you are one who can be helpful by encouraging and assisting newer publishers.</span></p>

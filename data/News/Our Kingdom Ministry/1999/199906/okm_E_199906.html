<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We Are Taught by Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">'Under divine direction an international educational program now operates in 233 lands. Nothing this world has to offer can compare with it. Our Grand Instructor, Jehovah, is teaching us how to benefit ourselves now as he also educates us for eternal life.—Isa. 30:20; 48:17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Schools of Divine Education: </span><span class="font12">Consider the schools currently in progress for the benefit of Jehovah’s people. The Theocratic Ministry School, conducted weekly in some 87,000 congregations, trains millions of Kingdom publishers to be effective ministers of the good news. Have you enrolled in it? Are you among the thousands who have attended the two-week Pioneer Service School? Perhaps the reduced hour requirement for regular pioneers will enable more to pioneer and qualify to attend this school. The two-month Ministerial Training School, now conducted in principal languages around the world, is equipping unmarried elders and ministerial servants to take on greater theocratic responsibilities. Periodically, all elders and ministerial servants receive specialized instruction in the Kingdom Ministry School.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Facilities at the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson, New York, are being used to house three special schools, which provide advanced theocratic training. The five-month course of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead prepares ministers for missionary work in foreign fields. Branch Committee members from around the world attend a two-month course on branch organization. In May 1999 a new two-month course for traveling overseers began with a class of 48 students from the United States and Canada. All of Jehovah’s servants ultimately receive fine benefits from the training Jehovah is providing through these various schools.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Taught for What Purpose?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">A member of the Governing Body stated: “Our current educational program is designed to bring all of Jehovah’s people everywhere into the fine condition of maturity described at Proverbs 1:1-4.” May Jehovah continue to give each one of us “the tongue of the taught ones.” —Isa. 50:4.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You See Only the Outward Appearance?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">'As we conduct our public ministry, our first impression of some people may make us hesitate to share the good news with them. For example, how would you react if a fierce-looking man always eyed you suspiciously when you called on his neighbor who had shown interest in the truth? A pioneer sister who experienced this decided to approach the man and speak to him. He greeted her rudely. But, amazingly, he listened to the Bible’s message and with some excitement agreed to study. As a result of the sister’s not judging by outward appearances, the way was opened for this man and his wife to learn the truth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Another sister was initially frightened by the outward appearance of a long-haired young man but persisted in witnessing to him briefly whenever he came into the store where she worked. Her efforts bore fruit, and the young man is now a baptized Witness. What will prevent us from hastily concluding that such ones will not respond?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Imitating the Example of Jesus: </span><span class="font12">Jesus knew that he would give his life for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">everyone.</span><span class="font12"> Hence, he was not put off by the external appearance of others. He realized that even those with unsavory reputations might be willing to change if given the proper help and incentive. (Matt. 9:9-13) He tried to help both rich and poor alike. (Matt. 11:5; Mark 10:17-22) May we not judge the people we meet in the ministry by their outward appearance, blinding ourselves to what might be a good heart condition. (Matt. 7:1; John 7:24) What can help us to imitate Jesus’ outstanding example?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Through our study of the Bible, we have come to appreciate that God’s Word has the power to change one’s thinking, conduct, and personality. (Eph. 4:22-24; Heb. 4:12) Therefore, while exercising due caution, we should keep a positive attitude and leave the rest in the hands of Jehovah, the One who reads human hearts.—1 Sam. 16:7; Acts 10:34, 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> May our impartial sharing of the good news with all sorts of people, regardless of their outward appearance, contribute to the great harvest work in these last days.—1 Tim. 2:3,4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Week Starting June 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 45</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 mln: </span><span class="font11">Local announcements. Selected Announcements from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font11"> Theocratic News.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 mln: </span><span class="font11">&quot;We Are Taught by Jehovah.” Limit introductory comments to less than a minute, and follow with a question-and-answer discussion. Invite audience to relate some of the benefits they have received from the Theocratic Ministry School, Pioneer Service School, Kingdom Ministry School, and so forth. Stress how these have helped Jehovah’s people to become more effective in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 mln: </span><span class="font11">“Make Your Time Count.” Discussion between a Congregation Book Study conductor and one or two experienced publishers who relate how they manage their time to share as fully as possible in the field service. They explain the importance of a workable schedule and stress the need for one. They tell how they avoid such time wasters as getting a late start, poor advance planning, or too much socializing during the ministry. Considering local circumstances, offer practical suggestions on how to make time count.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 48 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Week Starting June 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 63</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 mln: </span><span class="font11">Local announcements. Accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15 mln: </span><span class="font11">Local needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font11">“Can You Give a Helping Hand?&quot; Audience discussion conducted by an elder. Include the suggestions given in the October 8, 1995, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!, </span><span class="font11">pages 8-9, for helping single parents. Invite some to express their appreciation for the loving assistance that they have received from others in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 53 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Week Starting June 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 72</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 min: </span><span class="font11">Local announcements. If the congregation has copies of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font11"> books in stock, show how they can be used to good advantage in the ministry during the summer months, when we are more likely to find teenagers at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">17 min: </span><span class="font11">Make Good Use of Videos and Sound Dramas. Could the 10 videos and 11 sound drama audiocassettes provided by the Society be put to better use? Have you and your family watched or listened to every one of them? Review several titles, pointing out how they can enhance our reading of the Bible, strengthen our spirituality, and give a fine witness to the truth. Play brief excerpts from two or three audiocassettes. Ask the audience to comment on which video or sound drama they found especially effective in encouraging their own family or in directing new ones to the organization. Relate some experiences showing good results. (See the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1999 Yearbook,</span><span class="font11"> pages 51-2.) Encourage all to make good use of the videos and sound dramas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">18 min: </span><span class="font11">“Do You See Only the Outward Appearance?” Talk and audience discussion. Stress the reasons why we should not hastily form opinions about the people we meet. Briefly review the lesson Jehovah taught Jonah, who wrongly judged those whom he viewed as unworthy. (See the August 15, 1997, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> pages 21-2, paragraphs 17-19.) Invite audience to comment on the variety of people they have encountered in the territory, telling how they maintain a positive attitude toward them and leave judgment In Jehovah’s hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 77 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Week Starting June 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Song 85</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">12 mln: </span><span class="font11">Local announcements. Remind all to turn in field service reports for June. Review literature offer for July. Show the brochures that are locally available in good supply, and suggest one or two features that we can highlight in our presentations. Include a well-rehearsed demonstration. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">13 mln: </span><span class="font11">Why Does Jehovah Permit Persecution of His People? Talk by an elder, based on </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses —Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom,</span><span class="font11"> pages 676-7. As Jesus foretold, we are ‘hated by all the nations.' (Matt. 24:9) We may face opposition when we share in the ministry, associate with worldly relatives, or deal with non-Witnesses in the workplace or at school. In a positive way, speaker explains why Jehovah permits such persecution or opposition and how our enduring It will ultimately lead to blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 mln: </span><span class="font11">Go Where the People Are! A talk based on the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1997 Yearbook,</span><span class="font11"> pages 42-8. While we should continue sharing regularly in house-to-house witnessing, we eagerly look for opportunities to do informal witnessing— anytime, anywhere. Relate experiences from the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> showing how others have done so with good success while riding a bus, walking on the street or beach, approaching parked cars, going to truck stops, using the telephone, and writing letters. As time permits, invite audience to relate some experiences of their own. Encourage all to take advantage of every opportunity to give a witness wherever the people are.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Give a Helping Hand?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">‘The apostle Paul admonished congregation members to “have the same care for one another.’’ (1 Cor. 12:25) Hence, we should show a personal interest in one another and be willing to render loving help when it is needed. As one example, some of the spiritual sisters in our midst are raising their children in the truth single-handedly. These sisters are carrying the full load of responsibility for the spiritual training of their offspring. Certainly they are worthy of our kind encouragement and practical assistance “according to their needs.” (Rom. 12:13a) Can you give them a helping hand?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Ways You Might Help: </span><span class="font12">Offering rides to meetings and assemblies to those who must rely on public transportation may result in considerable financial savings for that family. Helping a mother care for her small children at meetings may mean, that she can benefit more fully from the program. Likewise, offering to assist her when she takes the children out in field service may provide her some relief. Displaying a genuine interest in the children—befriending them—can do much to influence our youths in a positive way. Occasionally inviting a single-parent family to sit in on your family study would provide a refreshing spiritual lift.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Be Discreet: </span><span class="font12">We should be careful not to force our help upon one who does not feel the need for it. Nor would we want to intrude into a person’s family affairs while rendering needed help. Of course, sisters and married couples would be in the best position to come to the aid of a sister who is in need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> All Christians are encouraged to “follow the course of hospitality” toward one another. (Rom. 12:13b) Giving a helping hand to our spiritual brothers and sisters is one of the many ways we show the Christlike love that we have among ourselves.—John 13:35.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Everyone has the same amount of time at his disposal each week. The portion that we devote to spreading the good news is especially valuable because it is time spent in a lifesaving work. (Rom. 1:16) We show our appreciation for this by preparing well for the service planned, arriving at meetings for service on time, and leaving promptly for the territory. We would rather be preaching than waiting. Since Jehovah has taught us that “for everything there is an appointed time,” we need to make the time that we have set aside for the ministry really count.—Eccl. 3:1.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Manage Your Time Wisely: </span><span class="font12">Many blessings come to us when we steadfastly hold to a schedule that allows for regular participation in the field ministry. Naturally, the good results that we achieve in the ministry should be proportionate to the amount of time spent in the service. With some slight adjustments to our routine, could we devote more time to the field service? For example, after magazine activity on Saturday, could we take some additional time to make a few return visits? If we have been in the field ministry for a while on Sunday, could we spend some time also making return visits or conducting a Bible study? Would it be possible to supplement our house-to-house activity with some street witnessing? In these or other ways, we may be able to improve in our service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> When we are out in the ministry, we can lose valuable time if we are not careful. Of course, when weather conditions are severe, a short break will refresh us and help us to keep going. Be balanced, however, since such breaks may not always be necessary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> In recent years it has become increasingly difficult to find people at home. To cope with this situation, many publishers do their door-to-door witnessing at a different time of day. Why not try witnessing in the late afternoon or early evening?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> It is better if we do not visit with one another while engaging in street work. Instead, stand apart from one another and approach the people so as to start conversations with them. Thus time will be managed more effectively and greater joy will be derived from the work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Seize Opportunities to Witness: </span><span class="font12">When a householder said that she was not interested, a Witness asked if there was anyone else in the house with whom she might talk. This led to a conversation with the man of the house, who had been ill for many years and was largely confined to bed. The hope set out in God’s Word renewed his interest in life. He was soon out of bed, attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall, and sharing his newfound hope with others!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> A teenage sister applied the suggestion to engage in field service during the hour before the Congregation Book Study. At her first door, she met a 13-year-old girl who listened intently and took literature. The next day at school, the young sister saw this same girl. Soon thereafter, she offered to study the Bible with her, and the girl accepted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Make It Quality Time: </span><span class="font12">Having a regular share in field service helps us develop our skills in presenting the good news. Can you improve your ability to start a conversation at the door by using a more effective introduction? Could you become a more skillful teacher when conducting a home Bible study? By doing so, you can truly make your time in the service count and make your ministry more productive.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’Since “the time left is reduced,” our lives should be filled with Christian works. (1 Cor. 7:29) Allotting time for the preaching activity should be high on our list of priorities. Let us have a healthy, zealous share in the ministry. Time is a wonderful asset that Jehovah has given us. Always use it wisely and make it count.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Consider These Suggestions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">■ Arrive at meetings for service on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">■ Within reason, keep witnessing groups small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">■ Avoid delays in getting to the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">■ Work territory when most people are at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">■ Work alone at times if it is safe to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">■ Make return visits nearest to the door-to-door territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">■ Keep busy in service when others in the group are delayed at a door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">■ Whenever possible, depending on circumstances, stay out longer than an hour.</span></p>

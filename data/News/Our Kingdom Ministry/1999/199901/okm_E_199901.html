<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Resolve—To Pursue Jehovah’s Way of Life</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup>A highlight of the “God’s Way of Life” Conventions was the resolution that was adopted in the concluding talk. It began with the declaration: “We . . . wholeheartedly agree that God’s way is the best way of life.” Recall some high points of that resolution to which we said, “AYE!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> It is our resolve to remain clean before Jehovah, without spot from the world. We will continue to put God’s will first in our lives. Using his Word, the Bible, as our guide, we will not deviate to the right or to the left, thus confirming that God’s way is far superior to the way of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">’The world in general disregards God’s way of life and reaps the consequences. (Jer. 10:23) We must therefore continue to be taught by our Grand Instructor, Jehovah, who says: “This is the way. Walk in it, you people.” (Isa. 30:21) Jehovah’s way of life, as set forth in the Scriptures, is superior in every respect. In order to pursue that way, it is imperative that we take full advantage of all that Jehovah teaches us.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah’s Superior Teaching Program: </span><span class="font12">Jehovah teaches us the real purpose of life and how to use our lives to the best advantage. He teaches us how to improve the quality of our lives mentally, morally, and spiritually. He teaches us how to live at peace with our brothers, our family, and our fellowman. He does this through his textbook, the Bible, and through his organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Our congregation meetings are of great importance in this regard. As we regularly attend and participate in all five meetings, we receive comprehensive training as ministers of the good news and a well-balanced education in Christian living. (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) Our Grand Instructor further provides theocratic education through assemblies and conventions. Our goal should be </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font12"> to miss a meeting or a session if our health and circumstances permit us to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> May we diligently continue pursuing God’s way of life in the days ahead, all to Jehovah’s praise and to our everlasting benefit!—Isa. 48:17.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Exercise Patience”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As we see the end of Satan’s old system drawing ever nearer, it is vital that we “exercise patience” while waiting on Jehovah’s day of deliverance. Especially at this late hour, wicked enemy forces are determined to divert our attention from the foremost issue of Jehovah’s sovereignty and tempt us to be distracted by multitudes of personal interests. In this way, Satan would trick us into giving up or slowing down in the Kingdompreaching work. (Jas. 5:7, 8; Matt. 24:13,14) In what ways can we manifest such needed patience?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> By Being Forbearing: </span><span class="font12">When we encounter apathy or opposition in our ministry, forbearance will help us to persevere in preaching. We will not be easily intimidated or offended if people we meet are abrupt or unkind. (1 Pet. 2:23) This inner strength can prevent us from speaking negatively of people in our territory who show indifference or animosity toward our work, realizing that such talk would discourage us and those who work with us in 'the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> By Patient Persistence: </span><span class="font12">It can tax our patience when after having a good discussion in field service, we cannot find the interested person at home again. The same is true if those with whom we study are slow to make progress or to take a stand for the truth. However, patient persistence is often rewarded with good results. (Gal. 6:9) A sister made a number of return visits on a young woman before a Bible study actually got under way. On the first five visits, the woman was preoccupied with other matters. On the sixth attempt, the sister got drenched in a thunderstorm, only to find nobody at home. Nevertheless, determined to give the woman one more chance, the sister called again and found the woman ready to study. Thereafter, the student made steady progress and in a short time dedicated her life to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> We know that Jehovah’s day will not be late. So we wait on his outworking of matters, knowing that divine patience will produce good fruitage. (Hab. 2:3; 2 Pet. 3: 9-15) We must exercise patience as Jehovah does and not give up in the ministry. “Through faith and patience,” look to Jehovah to reward you for your hard work—Heb. 6:10-12.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1999 “God’s Prophetic Word” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When the Israelites were in the wilderness, Jehovah instructed Moses to make two silver trumpets. If only one trumpet was sounded, the chieftains of the tribes were to gather at the entrance of the tent of meeting. Blasts from both trumpets would signal the whole assembly of Israel to come together. (Num. 10:1-4) Today, are we not thrilled when we hear announcements that, like trumpet blasts, gather us to our annual district conventions? At our conventions we receive Jehovah’s instructions and guidance by means of his Word and his appointed representatives. This helps us to continue steadfast in service to God. Do we not rejoice when we see thousands—perhaps tens of thousands—of faithful fellow worshipers gathered together in love and peace? We surely do!—Ps. 122:1, 7, 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> From May through September 1998, a total of 198 “God’s Way of Life” District and International Conventions were held in 69 cities throughout the contiguous United States. Brothers arid sisters in four convention cities (Long Beach and San Diego, California; Pontiac, Michigan; and Houston, Texas) hosted thousands of delegates from countries around the earth, who were attending the first international conventions held in the United States since 1978. The variety of languages spoken proved to be no barrier to the communication of warm love at the conventions. The brothers who opened their homes to accommodate foreign delegates experienced further delightful association. Missionaries and international servants returned to the United States to attend the conventions. Their presence proved to be spiritually encouraging to all. As we gather together for our 1999 district convention, we will have fresh opportunities to experience our precious brotherhood and to thank Jehovah for the unity he has given us.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Making Your Hotel Reservation: </span><span class="font13">Arrangements have been made to secure adequate hotel rooms near the convention sites. Each year, we are happy to provide you with information on how you can make rooming arrangements for the convention, and we appreciate very much your cooperation and support. The local Rooming Department has prepared a Recommended Lodging List of hotels that are now ready to accept reservations. Please follow the instructions in this insert in the box entitled “Steps in Making Your Hotel Reservation.” Because of fire and safety regulations, you should arrange for no more than four persons in each room. If a particular hotel will permit more than four persons to a room, this will be clearly indicated on the Recommended Lodging List.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Hotels available for your convention appear on the first Recommended Lodging List. When these hotels are filled, a revised list of hotels will be sent to your congregation. We are asking that once you make a reservation, please keep that reservation. Do not switch your reservation to another hotel, even if one that is closer or more desirable appears on a later list. Additional hotels are added because there are brothers and sisters who still need rooms, not to provide more choices for those who already have rooms reserved. Following this direction gives us the opportunity to demonstrate our love for our Christian brothers.—1 Cor. 10: 24; 1 Tim. 6:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> If you have called all the hotels on the list and no rooms are available, please inform your congregation secretary. He will contact the Rooming Department, using the address or telephone number shown at the top of each list. Frequently, hotels on the list will make additional rooms available closer to the time of the convention. When the Rooming Department has arranged this, these hotels will appear on a revised list. Please wait for the new list rather than make a reservation at a hotel not on the list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Sending Deposits to Hotels: </span><span class="font13">The only way to guarantee a room reservation is to make sure that the hotel receives your deposit. For each room reserved, a one-night deposit must be made within ten days of making your reservation. Without a deposit, the hotel has the right to give your room to someone else, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Handling Hotel Problems: </span><span class="font13">If you experience a problem with a hotel at any time, the local Rooming Department wants to know about it in order to assist you. For any difficulties experienced </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">before or after</span><span class="font13"> the convention, you may write or call the Rooming Department, using the address or telephone number shown at the top of the Recommended Lodging List. If a problem arises </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">during</span><span class="font13"> the convention, you should go to the convention Rooming Department and bring the matter to their attention so that it can be resolved before you check out of the hotel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Attending Another Convention: </span><span class="font13">If you plan to attend a convention other than the one to which your congregation is assigned, the congregation secretary can provide you with the address of the convention headquarters for the convention you will be attending. When you write for rooming or other information, enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope with your request. If there is more than one convention held in that city, be sure to indicate the dates for the convention you will attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Caring for Those With Special Needs: </span><span class="font13">Please be alert to the special needs of the elderly, the infirm, those in fulltime service, or others in your congregation who may require assistance in attending the convention. Relatives, the elders, and others in the congregation who are aware of the unique circumstances of those with special needs can lovingly help them make the necessary arrangements.—Compare 1 Timothy 5:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> The Society’s Special Needs Room Request form outlines the qualifications for submitting this form. This provision is only for publishers in good standing, including those with well-behaved children, who have been approved by the Congregation Service Committee. These requests should be sent to the Rooming Department as soon as possible, using the convention address shown on the reverse side of the form.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Expressing Appreciation: </span><span class="font13">One Witness family wrote to the manager of the hotel where they stayed: “Your hotel was the best hotel our family has ever stayed at. The rooms were thoroughly cleaned and fully supplied with everything we could possibly have needed. We enjoyed such a pleasant weekend because of the cooperation of everyone at your hotel. We want to thank you for participating with the Watchtower Convention arrangements by providing us rates we could afford.” Are you also grateful for the many arrangements made in your behalf? The Society is pleased to provide comfortable, affordable accommodations during the convention period, allowing us all to focus on the spiritual benefits of the convention and the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> It is encouraging to hear the praise given to Jehovah’s name because of the fine conduct of our brothers and sisters at the conventions. A hotel worker said: “Your delegates are the finest people we have here.” Another commented: “We love taking reservations from your people. They are all polite and have the right information ready. And they are the easiest group to work with.” The manager of a restaurant said: “We enjoy having a group of people in town that we can be proud of.” The restaurant gave a 10-percent discount to any delegates wearing a convention lapel badge! And a hotel manager stated: “It has been a pleasure having your people in our hotel.” These expressions are a fine testimony from people on the outside. The good reputation we have gained glorifies Jehovah and makes him proud of us.—1 Thess. 4:12; 1 Pet. 2:12.'</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> We encourage you to make your arrangements now to attend all three days of the 1999 “God’s Prophetic Word” District Convention. We look forward with you to hearing the spiritual “joyful cry and thanksgiving” of those worshiping God as a united throng. (Ps. 42:4) May Jehovah bless all the arrangements being made for our continued spiritual enrichment!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Steps in Making Your Hotel Reservation</span></p>

Require of Us?</span><span class="font12"> is a powerful tool to teach people the truth. Thousands of Bible studies are being started each week in this brochure. Have you been successful in starting and conducting a Bible study in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> While most find it easy to place the brochure, some And it difficult to know what to say to get into the study. What methods have others found to be effective in starting Bible studies using the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure? The following suggestions should be helpful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Offer to Demonstrate the Study: </span><span class="font12">When making the initial call or a return visit, rather than simply offering a Bible study to the householder, we can demonstrate how the Bible study course will be conducted. This will tend to remove the mystery and subsequent anxiety that many householders associate with the word “study.” Once we learn to demonstrate it, we will find that with a simple introduction, we can get right into the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Preparation Is the Key: </span><span class="font12">Our enthusiasm for starting Bible studies is directly related to how well we have prepared. Advance preparation will help us overcome any hesitancy we may have in sharing in the Bible study work. By practicing our presentation several times, we will be more conversational, able to express ourselves naturally and in our own words. This not only will help us to relax but will put the householder at ease as well.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> When rehearsing, it is helpful to time your presentation so that you can inform the householder how long it will take to demonstrate the study. After introducing himself, one brother says: “I stopped by to show you our free Bible study program. It takes about five minutes to demonstrate. Do you have five minutes?” Lesson 1 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require </span><span class="font12">brochure can be demonstrated in about five minutes. Of course, only selected scriptures can be read in this amount of time, but by completing the first lesson in a few minutes, the householder is able to experience his first study. Then let him know that when you return to study Lesson 2, you will take only 15 minutes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘The following presentation has proved to be effective:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “I would like to demonstrate for you a very simple, yet accelerated, home Bible study course using this brochure </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font12"> Many have found that in as little as 15 minutes a week for 16 weeks, they can find satisfying Scriptural answers to these important Bible questions.” Briefly show the table of contents. Turning to Lesson 1, say: “If you can give us about five minutes, we would like to show you how this works. Lesson 1 is entitled ‘How You Can Find Out What God Requires.’&quot; Next read the three questions, and explain the numbers in parentheses. Read paragraph 1, and show the householder how to locate the answer. The householder may be asked to read paragraph 2. Then say: “Based on this information, how would you answer this question? [Read the question again, and allow the householder to comment.] You will notice that there are scriptures associated with each paragraph. These direct our attention to the Bible’s answer to these questions. For example, let us read 2 Timothy 3:16, 17 and see if it supports the answer you gave concerning the author of the Bible.” After reading paragraph 3, considering the question, and reading John 17:3, draw the householder’s attention to the knowledge he or she has taken in by reviewing Lesson 1. At this point you can turn to Lesson 2 and read the last question, “What are two ways we can learn about God?” Then ask: “When would you have about 15 minutes so that we can do Lesson 2 and find the answer?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> It is important to keep the discussion simple and commend the householder whenever possible. When arranging for another visit, instead of asking if he wishes to continue, simply encourage him to follow the same procedure for the next lesson. Let him know that you look forward to returning. Some publishers have offered to do a lesson over the phone if scheduling became difficult. You may also encourage the student to put the brochure in a safe, convenient location so that it will be handy for your next visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Be Determined: </span><span class="font12">While the key to success is preparation, we must be determined to follow through. Teaching a lesson in a few minutes can be challenging, so be determined to practice the presentation as many times as necessary in order to be fluent when demonstrating the study. Try to demonstrate a study with everyone you meet at the door, informally, and in telephone witnessing. If you are having difficulty starting a Bible study, do not be discouraged. Success in starting Bible studies requires determination and a sincere desire to impart the truth to others. —Gal. 6:9.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11">■ Starting in February, and no later than March 1, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “How Real Is God to You?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Congregations should make arrangements to celebrate the Memorial this year on Thursday, April 1, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the Memorial emblems </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown.</span><span class="font11"> Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Although it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial celebration, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between programs to allow time to greet visitors, encourage newly interested ones, and benefit fully from the occasion. Consideration should also be given to traffic and parking problems, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ The special public talk for the 1999 Memorial season will be given on Sunday, April 18. The subject of the talk will be “True Friendship With God and Neighbor.” An outline will be provided.

No congregation should have the special talk before April 18, 1999.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office when reaching 18 years of age. All those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Adjustment in Hour Requirements for Pioneers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> All of us appreciate having hardworking regular and auxiliary pioneers in the congregation. Even where the territory is limited and thoroughly worked on a regular basis, the pioneers have set a fine example by their zealous Kingdom service. They have encouraged all the publishers to keep busy in searching for those who are “rightly disposed.”—Acts 13:48.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The Society has observed the mounting difficulties faced by pioneers, especially with regard to finding part-time secular work that will allow them to care adequately for their personal needs so as to remain in the full-time service. The present economic situation in many lands has also made it increasingly difficult for others to enter ,the pioneer work, even though that is their heartfelt desire. During recent months, these and other factors have been carefully considered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Therefore, in view of the above, the Society has reduced the hour requirement for both regular and auxiliary pioneers. Starting with the 1999 calendar year, the requirement for regular pioneers will be 70 hours each month, or a total of 840 hours for the year. The monthly requirement for auxiliary pioneers will be 50 hours. The hour requirement for special pioneers and missionaries remains unchanged, since provision is made by the Society to help them care for their basic material needs. Thus, they can concentrate more fully on their preaching and disciple-making work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> It is hoped that this adjustment in the hour requirements will help more pioneers to hold on to this precious privilege of service. It should also open the way for many more publishers to take up the regular and auxiliary pioneer work. What a blessing this should prove to be for everyone in the congregation!</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Man has stored away millions of old books in libraries in every corner of the earth. Yet, of what everlasting benefit have they been to the human race? (Eccl. 12:12) Of much greater worth are publications that focus attention on God’s Kingdom and on what it will do for mankind. Most congregations have in stock a variety of such books that were published prior to 1985. During January we will offer these older books to the public.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> They Have Real Value: </span><span class="font12">While some of us may feel that these books are out-of-date in comparison with our newer publications, we must remember that they contain Scriptural truth. The Kingdom message that they explain is still valuable today and, if heeded, can be lifesaving. (John 17:3) Therefore, we should put forth an extra effort to make good use of these older books.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Underscoring their value is the experience of a woman who inherited a number of older Watch Tower publications from her grandmother. A Witness asked the woman if she had any idea of the publications’ real value. The woman replied: “I don’t know their value, but how can I find out?” The woman accepted a Bible study, came into the truth, and thereafter treasured her grandmother’s library. What a valuable inheritance that collection of older books proved to be!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Get Them Into Circulation: </span><span class="font12">In addition to offering the older books from house to house, be sure to offer them when making return visits on people who you know enjoy reading our publications, including those who subscribe to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> and who are on your magazine route. For those who are studying the Bible with you, selected older books can provide a background knowledge that will broaden their understanding of the truth. Do not forget to obtain any of the older books that are missing from your personal collection. In this way, you will accumulate a valuable theocratic library, which can be used to enrich your periods of personal study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Rather than keeping our older books in storage, let us make good use of them to stimulate the people we meet to “fear the true God and keep his commandments.”—Eccl. 12:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Overseers Taking the Lead</span><br><br><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>—Congregation Book Study Conductors</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> It is an outstanding privilege for a qualified elder or ministerial servant to serve as a Congregation Book Study conductor. Looking after the spiritual needs of those in his group is a serious responsibility. His duties fall into three categories.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Capable Teaching: </span><span class="font12">It requires thorough preparation for the Congregation Book Study conductor to impart understanding to the group each week. He seeks to enhance appreciation for the material being studied. Instead of commenting excessively himself during the study, when necessary he will formulate additional pointed questions to draw out the main points of the lesson. His challenge is to make the study interesting and instructive and to involve everyone in the discussion. His objective is to build up spiritually, to highlight the practical value of the study, and to make the material reach both mind and heart. —1 Thess. 2:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Helpful Shepherding: </span><span class="font12">The Congregation Book Study conductor is “like a hiding place from the wind and a place of concealment from the rainstorm.&quot; (Isa. 32:2) He really cares for all in his group and sees to it that spiritual help is provided when one of those in his charge is discouraged.—Ezek. 34:15,16; 1 Thess. 2: 7,8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Zealous Evangelizing: </span><span class="font12">The Congregation Book Study conductor is conscientious about making practical arrangements for all in his group to participate fully in the field ministry. He takes the lead in the evangelizing work, knowing that the regularity, zeal, and enthusiasm he shows for the service will be reflected in the rest of the group. (Col. 4:17; 2 Thess. 3:9) In time, he endeavors to work in service with each member of his group. If we want to sharpen our preaching and teaching skills in the ministry, the Congregation Book Study conductor can help us to attain our goal. —1 Tim. 4:16; 2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> We are truly blessed with these gifts in men who stand ready to offer us spiritual assistance and loving support. (1 Thess. 5:14) May we show our appreciation for this wonderful provision from Jehovah by our regular participation in the book study and our faithful support of the evangelizing work—Heb. 10:25.</span></p></li></ul>

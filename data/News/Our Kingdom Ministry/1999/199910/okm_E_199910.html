<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Get More Joy From Meetings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Meetings are vital to our spiritual well-being. The joy that we derive from them is directly related to what we do before, during, and after meetings. How can we help ourselves and others to keep the joy in attending meetings at a high level?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Before Meetings: </span><span class="font6">Preparation has a direct bearing on the enjoyment we get from meetings. When we are well prepared, we are more inclined to pay attention and to participate. Additionally, any meeting assignment that we receive should be prepared well, with the objectives of conveying the information accurately according to instructions and of holding the interest of the audience. We should rehearse thoroughly. When we contribute to lively and upbuilding meetings that benefit everyone, our personal progress becomes evident and we have greater joy.—1 Tim. 4: 15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> During Meetings: </span><span class="font6">Commenting at meetings can help us enjoy them more. Parts that call for audience participation should be viewed as personal assignments for everyone in the congregation. Comments that are concise and to the point usually achieve the most good. Briefly relating upbuilding experiences can be very encouraging and invigorating, and we should be alert to include these whenever the program calls for them. (Prov. 15:23; Acts 15:3) When presenting a part on the meeting, we should speak with enthusiasm and conviction, making it interesting, realistic, and practical.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> After Meetings: </span><span class="font6">Sharing with others a kind word, a friendly greeting, and a few key points that were considered at meetings will benefit us all. Expressing our joy at seeing the young, the old, and the new ones participate deepens the love of the brotherhood. Instead of speaking negatively of some who may miss meetings, we should share with them our joy from attending, thereby encouraging them to attend.—Heb. 10:24,25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> Let us not deprive ourselves of this essential provision for having an interchange of encouragement. (Rom. 1:11, 12) By conscientiously contributing every earnest effort, we can all maintain joy in attending Christian meetings.</span></p>

(3) Arrange your personal service schedule to include some magazine activity every month. (4) Plan to do more informal witnessing using magazines to start conversations. (5) Take specialized articles to business and professional people who are most likely to be interested in them. (6) Keep an accurate record of placements, and build up a magazine route, returning regularly with the latest issues. (7) Make good use of any older copies of the magazines so that none accumulate. Display the current magazines, and point out articles that are likely to stir interest.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC MINISTRY SCHOOL SCHEDULE FOR 2000</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">INSTRUCTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During 2000 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SOURCE MATERIAL: The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bil2], The Watchtower </span><span class="font6">[w], </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” </span><span class="font6">(1990 Edition) [si], </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Insight on the ScripturesVolwme</span><span class="font6"> 2 [ii-2], and “Bible Topics for Discussion” as found in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font6"> [id] will be the basis for assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The school should begin ON TIME with song, prayer, and a brief welcome. There is no need to give a preview of what is on the program. As the school overseer introduces each part, he will mention the subject to be developed. Proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ASSIGNMENT NO. 1:15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant, and it will be based on </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial. ”</span><span class="font6"> When based on </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> this assignment should be delivered as a 15-minute instruction talk with no oral review; when based on the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture”</span><span class="font6"> book, it should be delivered as a 10- to 12-minute talk, followed by a 3-to 5-minute oral review using the printed questions in the publication. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">practical value</span><span class="font6"> of the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. The theme shown should be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers assigned this talk should be careful to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">keep within the time limit.</span><span class="font6"> Private counsel may be given if necessary or if requested by the speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant who will effectively apply the material to local needs. No theme is necessary. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. A 30- to 60-second overall review of the assigned chapters may be included. The principal objective, however, is to help the audience to appreciate </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font6"> the information is of value to us. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms by the school overseer. &lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ASSIGNMENT NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. This will apply in the main school as well as In the auxiliary groups. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the students to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, and application of principles may be included. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">All</span><span class="font6"> the assigned verses should be read without a break. Of course, when the verses to be read are not consecutive, the student may cite the verse where the reading continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ASSIGNMENT NO. 3: 5 minutes. This will be assigned to a sister. The subject for this presentation will be based on “Bible Topics for Discussion” as found in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font6"> The setting may be an informal witness, a return visit, or a home Bible study, and the participants may be either seated or standing. The school overseer will be particularly interested in the way the student develops the assigned theme and helps the householder to reason on the scriptures. The student assigned this part should know how to read. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but an additional assistant may be used. Not the setting but the effective use of the Bible should be given prime consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ASSIGNMENT NO. 4: 5 minutes. The subject for this assignment will be based on a Bible character or on “Bible Topics for Discussion” as found in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font6"> When this assignment is based on a Bible character, source material can be found under the Bible character’s name in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Insight on the Scriptures,</span><span class="font6"> Volume 2. The student should study Scriptural references in the material in order to get a clear picture of the Bible character—the events of his life, as well as his personality, traits, and attitude. Thereafter, the student should develop the assigned theme and select appropriate scriptures to be used. Additional scriptures that highlight Bible principles that tie in with the theme may be included. The purpose of considering a Bible character is to show what can be learned from his example. Acts of faithfulness, courage, humility, and unselfishness furnish good examples to be followed; unfaithful acts as well as undesirable traits stand as strong warnings to turn Christians away from an improper course. When this part is based on “Bible Topics for Discussion,” the assigned theme should be used, and the student should endeavor to make practical application of the scriptures. A brother or a sister may be given Assignment No. 4. When assigned to a brother, it should always be a talk. When assigned to a sister, it should be presented as outlined for Assignment No. 3. Additionally, whenever the theme for Assignment No. 4 is preceded by #, it should preferably be assigned to a brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">•SUPPLEMENTAL BIBLE-READING SCHEDULE: This is set forth in brackets after the song number for each week. By following this schedule, reading about ten pages a week, the entire Bible can be read in three years. No parts on the school program or the written review are based on the supplemental reading schedule.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Are You Moving?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">When the answer to that question Is yes, there are many things that you and others need to take the initiative to do. By following the basic steps outlined below, you will quickly get established in your new congregation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">(1) Once you know where you are going, your present congregation secretary may be able to obtain the address of the Kingdom Hall of your new congregation. Upon arriving in that area, immediately locate the hall and confirm the congregation meeting times. If more than one congregation uses the Kingdom Hall, ask the elders to tell you in which congregation’s territory you are living. Do not delay in attending the meetings and in getting acquainted with the local elders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(2) The secretaries of both your present congregation and your new one will cooperate in the transfer of the Congregation’s Publisher Record cards for you and your family. A letter of introduction will also be sent to the elders of your new congregation. (See the February 1991 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font6"> Question Box.) The Congregation Service Committee there should advise the appropriate book study conductor of your arrival so that he can contact you and help you locate your new book study group.—Rom. 15:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(3) All publishers in your new congregation have a joyful part to play—that of getting acquainted with you and making you feel welcome. (Compare 3 John 8.) Of course, this means that you must be present at the meetings so that you can enjoy an encouraging and upbuilding interchange with the brothers and sisters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(4) You should not wait until all the work involved in moving is completed before sharing in the field ministry with your new congregation. As you put Kingdom interests first, other matters will be cared for, and you will feel very comfortable in your new surroundings. (Matt. 6: 33) When you are settled in your new home, likely you will want to invite some from the congregation to visit and get better acquainted.—Rom. 12: 13b.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Moving is a big project. However, when everyone involved does what is recommended, there will be no spiritual setbacks. All will be favorably impressed with our loving Christian brotherhood.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>What Will You Say to a Jewish Person?</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> In the first century, many of “the sons of Israel” responded appreciatively to the preaching of Jesus and his apostles. (Acts 10:36) As was true then, a number of sincere Jews today are wholeheartedly embracing the truth—not only in Israel but also in Russia, the United States, and other countries. Would you like to be more successful in reaching out to Jewish people? The following suggestions will help you give a tactful witness both to religious and to secular Jews.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Witnessing to Religious Jews: </span><span class="font6">It should be realized that religious Jews are often more concerned with observing the traditions of the rabbis than with defining specific doctrines. Indeed, they generally view tradition as having authority equal to the Scriptures. Hence, they are not necessarily interested in discussing .deep Bible subjects. They also tend to think of the Bible as a Christian book. For that reason, it is usually best when referring to the Bible to use the terms “the Hebrew Scriptures,” “the Torah,” or “the Scriptures.” An excellent publication prepared especially for the Jewish population is the brochure </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Will There Ever Be a World Without War?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> What topics might interest religious Jews? Well, they believe that there is one God, who is keenly interested in man. They also believe that God does intervene in human affairs. You might use these points to establish common ground. In addition, most Jews are keenly aware of the suffering of their people during World War H. They wonder why God permitted such injustice and when wickedness will come to an end. We are well equipped to answer such questions, referring, for example, to what our brothers experienced during the Holocaust.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Of course, to avoid alienating the householder, it is best not to bring up the matter of the identity of the Messiah too soon in the conversation. Instead, you might discuss the role that Moses played in Israel’s history and ask the householder if he believes that Moses’ teachings are relevant today. When it seems appropriate to discuss the identity of the Messiah, you might first read Deuteronomy 18:15, which states: “A prophet from your own midst, from your brothers, like me, is what Jehovah your God will raise up for you—to him you people should listen.” Ask the householder who it was that Moses had in mind when he spoke of a prophet like himself. Then cover a few points in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World Without War</span><span class="font6"> brochure, page 14, paragraphs 17 and 18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Secular Jews View Matters Differently: </span><span class="font6">Not everyone who identifies himself as Jewish accepts the teachings of Judaism. Many Jews are secular in their .outlook. They are more interested in promoting a separate Jewish identity, with its culture, tradition, and education, than in practicing the Jewish religion. Some secular Jews are agnostics—a few are even atheists. Initially, little would be gained by quoting extensively from the Hebrew Scriptures. It would be more beneficial to approach the conversation as you would any discussion with a person who is not religious. You might explain, for example, how the Bible is practical for our day. If the householder does not believe that the Bible is inspired, some points in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World Without War</span><span class="font6"> brochure may be helpful, particularly those found in the section on page 3 entitled “The Bible —Inspired by God?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> When witnessing to a Jewish person, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Most of us have had the sad experience of losing a loved one in death. What do you think happens to us when we die?” Allow for a response. Then direct the householder to the box entitled “Death and the Soul —What Are They?” on page 22 of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World Without War</span><span class="font6"> brochure. The box compares what the Scriptures say about life after death with what the rabbis teach. Then turn to paragraph 17 on page 23, and show that according to the Scriptures, the dead will be resurrected to life on a paradise earth. Offer the brochure. In preparation for the return visit, you might mention that the patriarch Job entertained the resurrection hope. Refer to the scriptures cited at the end of paragraph 17, and offer to return and discuss them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’The books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Acts record experiences of Jews who listened to and acted on the truth. Jehovah is still holding the way to everlasting life open. Many sincere Jews may yet learn about Jehovah, the true God, so that they too can live forever in God’s new world. —Mic. 4:1-4.</span></p>

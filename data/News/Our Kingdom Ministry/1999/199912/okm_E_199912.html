<p><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">December 1999 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 12/99 Vol. 42, No. 12</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Imitate Jehovah’s Impartiality</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is concerned about people. He impartially accepts anyone who does his will. (Acts 10:34, 35) When Jesus preached to people, he likewise was impartial. (Luke 20:21) We need to imitate their example, as did Paul, who wrote: “There is the same Lord over all, who is rich to all those calling upon him.” —Rom. 10:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Proclaiming the good news of God’s Kingdom to all whom we meet brings glory to God. We must continue to share this wonderful message with others, regardless of their race, social status, education, or financial standing. (Rom. 10:11-13) This means preaching to those who will listen—men, women, young, and elderly. We need to call at every door to give each householder an opportunity to hear the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Take an Interest in Everyone: </span><span class="font14">Our goal is to contact everyone we can. With this in mind, some publishers have been successful in witnessing to people in doctor’s offices, hospitals, nursing homes, welfare offices, and rehabilitation centers. Additionally, publishers have witnessed to funeral directors, school supervisors and counselors, and judges. When approaching officials, it is appropriate to express appreciation to them for the helpful services they provide in the community. Be respectful, and select timely articles that deal particularly with their type of work and the problems associated with it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> In one instance a sister managed to speak to a judge in his office. After a lively conversation, he volunteered this comment: “Do you know what I like about Jehovah’s Witnesses? They have well-founded principles from which they do not deviate.” A fine witness was given to this influential person.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> We cannot read the hearts of people. However, by talking with everyone we meet, we show our faith in God’s ability to direct our work. In addition, this gives people the privilege to hear and respond to the message of hope. (1 Tim. 2:3,4) Let us use our time wisely and endeavor to imitate Jehovah’s impartiality by reaching all the people we can with the good news.—Rom. 2:11; Eph. 5:1, 2.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Haven’t We Heard That Before?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Of course we have! Jehovah repeats many things in his Word for the benefit of his people. Jesus often repeated his teachings about various aspects of the Kingdom. His apostles continually reviewed spiritual matters with those who were firmly grounded in the truth.—Rom. 15:15; 2 Pet. 1:12, 13; 3:1,2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> In our time Jehovah’s organization has arranged for important subjects to be reviewed over and over again at congregation meetings. Certain publications have been studied repeatedly. Yes, it is important to hear things that we have heard before!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Repetition Fills a Vital Need: </span><span class="font14">Jehovah’s reminders deepen our understanding, expand our viewpoint, and strengthen our determination to stay on course spiritually. (Ps. 119:129) Reviewing God’s standards and principles is like looking in a mirror. It helps us scrutinize ourselves and counteracts the tendency to be “a forgetful hearer.”—Jas. 1: 22-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> If we do&lt; not keep reminding ourselves of the truth, other things will influence our hearts. God’s reminders strengthen us to resist the corrupting influences of Satan’s world. (Ps. 119: 2, 3, 99, 133; Phil. 3:1) The regular reminders we receive regarding the fulfillment of God’s purposes prompt us to “keep on the watch.” (Mark 13:32-37) Repetition of Scriptural truths helps us remain on the road to everlasting life.—Ps. 119:144.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> How to Benefit Personally: </span><span class="font14">We must ‘incline our hearts to God’s reminders.’ (Ps. 119:36) When a familiar subject is to be considered at a congregation meeting, we should prepare in advance, look up the cited scriptures, and reflect on how we can apply the information. Let us not skip the written review in the Theocratic Ministry School, thinking that it is not needed. (Luke 8:18) Never would we want to become inattentive because basic truths are often repeated at our meetings.—Heb. 5:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> May we share the attitude of the psalmist: “In the way of your reminders I have exulted, just as over all other valuable things.” (Ps. 119:14) Yes, we have heard these valuable things before, and likely we will hear them again. Why? Because Jehovah knows that we need to hear them!</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>2000 “Doers of God’s Word” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> “I will laud you in the big congregation; among a numerous people I shall praise you.” (Ps. 35:18) Imagine how thrilled David would be today to see so many thousands peacefully assembling together to take in divine instruction at our conventions! Were you among the 1,414,534 who attended one of the “God’s Prophetic Word” District Conventions? From late May through early September 1999, a total of 201 conventions were held in 71 cities in the contiguous United States. Our district conventions in 2000 will provide us with new opportunities to gather with fellow praisers of Jehovah, who are “conscious of their spiritual need” and happy and eager to “hear what the spirit says to the congregations.”—Matt. 5:3; Rev. 2:29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Making Your Hotel Reservation: </span><span class="font14">Each year we are happy to provide you with information on how you can make rooming arrangements for the convention, and we appreciate very much your cooperation with these instructions. The local Rooming Department has prepared a Recommended Lodging List of hotels that will begin accepting reservations in January. Please carefully follow the instructions in this insert in the box entitled “Steps in Making Your Hotel Reservation.” Because of Are and safety regulations, you should arrange for no more than four persons in each room. If a particular hotel peipnits more than four persons to a room, this will be clearly indicated on the Recommended Lodging List under the heading “Adults.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> Hotels available for your convention appear on the first Recommended Lodging List. When these hotels are filled, a revised list will be sent to your congregation. If you have called all the hotels on the list and no rooms are available, please inform your congregation secretary. Using the address or telephone number shown at the top of the list, he will contact the Rooming Department and advise them of the situation. Rather than making a reservation at a hotel not on the list, wait for the new list.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Program Times</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Friday and Saturday 9:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Sunday 9:30 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Once you make a reservation, please do not switch your reservation to another hotel. Hotels are added because there are brothers and sisters who still need rooms, not to provide more choices for those who already have rooms reserved. Following this direction gives us the opportunity to demonstrate our love for our Christian brothers and to avoid the “me first” attitude so prevalent in the world today. —1 Cor. 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Sending Deposits to Hotels and Handling Hotel Problems: </span><span class="font14">To guarantee a room reservation, within ten days of making your reservation, a one-night deposit must be made for each room reserved. Without a deposit, the hotel has the right to give your room to someone else. For any difficulties experienced before or after the convention, you may write or call the Rooming Department, using the address or telephone number shown at the top of the Recommended Lodging List. If a problem arises during the convention, you should go to the convention Rooming Department as soon as possible so that the brothers can assist you before you check out of the hotel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Caring for Those With Special Heeds: </span><span class="font14">Relatives, the elders, and others in the congregation who are aware of the unique circumstances of the elderly, the infirm, full-time servants, or others with special needs can show their loving concern and care by assisting these ones to attend the convention. (Compare 1 Timothy 5:4.) The Society’s Special Needs Room Request form outlines the qualifications for submitting this form. This provision is only for publishers in good standing, including those with well-behaved children, who have been approved by the Congregation Service Committee. These requests should be sent to the Rooming Department as soon as possible, using the convention address shown on the reverse side of the form.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Attending Another Convention: </span><span class="font14">If you need a Recommended Lodging List or information for another convention, the congregation secretary can provide you with the address of the convention headquarters, which is found on the reverse side of the Special Needs Room Request form. Always enclose a stamped, selfaddressed envelope with your request. If there is more than one convention held in that city, be sure to indicate the dates of the convention you will attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Arrange to Be in Attendance All Three Days: </span><span class="font14">Has Satan tried to distract you from giving attention to spiritual things? Sadly, many brothers and sisters and their families are missing out on vital spiritual food. How? By not attending the Friday district convention sessions. In some instances it has been noted that a large percentage of our brothers are missing the spiritual instruction and fellowship that the Friday sessions provide.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> It is possible that some brothers are reluctant to approach their employers to request the time off to attend the convention. Is this your situation? Why not pray to Jehovah about the matter and muster up the courage to explain your situation to your employer? Remember the good outcome for Nehemiah, who was in a similar situation.. (Neh. 2:1-6) Have faith in our heavenly Father’s willingness to help you, knowing that if you put Kingdom interests first, he will provide life’s necessities.—Matt. 6: 32b, 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> How Do Our Conventions Affect You? </span><span class="font14">A sister from the eastern United States wrote: “Thank you so much for the 1999 district convention. Associating with brothers whom I see only once each year brings me much joy. I came in contact with the truth as a pregnant teenager, and I still recall with great fondness when my Bible study conductor took me to my first convention. I looked at the clouds above my head in that open-air stadium as we sang the Kingdom song ‘Myriads of Brothers,’ and I wept. ‘With all these beautiful people around me,’ I asked myself, ‘how could Jehovah want me?’ That day I decided to serve Jehovah fully.” How heartwarming! It is certainly a pleasure to be associated with Jehovah’s clean people, is it not?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>11</sup> During the final part of the last days, we need our annual district convention more than ever before. It is a provision from Jehovah to maintain our spiritual health and balance. Therefore, be resolved to attend all three days of this year’s “Doers of God’s Word” District Convention. How can you follow through with your resolve? Ask your employer beforehand for the time off from work to attend the entire convention. If your means are limited, start now to set aside the necessary funds to attend. Ask Jehovah to help you overcome any obstacle. As you do so, you can look forward to enjoying the warm companionship of your brothers and sisters and to hearing the sayings of everlasting life from our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah. —Compare John 6:68.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">‘The Theocratic Ministry School has proved to be a rich blessing to Jehovah’s people. Over the past 50 years, it has helped millions to develop their abilities as public speakers and teachers of Bible truths. (Ps. 145:10-12; Matt. 28: 19, 20) Can you see how the school has helped you? It can continue to do so during 2000 if you share in it fully and apply the counsel that is given.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Instructions about assignments and the publications that will be used are listed on the first page of the school schedule for 2000. The time allotted for each part, the source material, how the material is to be presented, and other details are considered. Please take the time to read the instructions carefully and apply them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Weekly Bible Reading: </span><span class="font14">There are two separate programs for weekly Bible reading listed on the school schedule. One is the standard reading program that covers about five pages of the Bible. Bible highlights are based on this reading. The other reading program is supplemental and covers twice as much material. By following this program, you will be able to read the entire Bible in three years. It is understood that some may want to read more than is scheduled in the supplemental program, and others may not be able to keep up with it. Rather than comparing yourself with others, rejoice in what you can accomplish. (Gal. 6:4) The vital thing is to read God’s Word daily.—Ps. 1:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> To enroll in the Theocratic Ministry School, you should speak with the school overseer. Please take your assignments seriously, and do not cancel unnecessarily.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> “I am an atheist,” a professor from Poland told a missionary in Africa. However, the sister was able to have a discussion with the woman and gave her the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font14"> When the missionary returned the next week, the professor told her: “I’m no longer an atheist!” She had read the entire </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Creation </span><span class="font14">book and now asked for a Bible study. What can you do to succeed in giving a witness to those who say that they do not believe in God? First, consider the various reasons why people make this claim.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Factors That Contribute to Disbelief: </span><span class="font14">Not all atheists were raised as such. Many were exposed to a form of religion and at one time believed in God. However, serious health or family problems or certain injustices they, experienced weakened their faith. For others, courses taught in schools of higher learning have had a negative impact on their concept of God. Note the following examples of atheists who eventually developed a strong belief in Jehovah God and became his Witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>3</sup> A woman in Paris had been born with a debilitating bone disease. Although baptized as a Catholic, she proclaimed herself an atheist. When she asked the nuns why God had allowed her to be born with such a disability, their answer was: “Because he loves you.” She refused to accept that absurd idea. Also, consider a young person in Finland who was diagnosed as having an incurable muscle disease and was confined to a wheelchair. His mother took him to a Pentecostal who claimed to cure sick people. But there was no miraculous healing. As a result, the young man lost interest in God and became an atheist.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> A man in Honduras was raised a Catholic but studied Socialist philosophy and atheism. Convinced by university teaching that mankind is the product of evolution, he ceased to believe in God. Similarly, a woman in the United States was raised a Methodist. In college, she took psychology classes. How was her belief affected? She said: “In one summer they destroyed every bit of faith I had in religion.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Reaching the Hearts of Sincere Ones: </span><span class="font14">Many individuals who say that they do not believe in God would appreciate knowing if there is a solution to the problems of poor health, family discord, injustice, and so forth. They are sincerely interested in finding answers to such questions as: ‘Why does evil exist?’ ‘Why do bad things happen to good people?’ and ‘What is the meaning of life?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> A husband and wife living in Switzerland had both been raised as atheists. When they were first contacted with the truth, their response was negative. But they had serious family problems and were considering divorce. When the Witness visited again, she showed the couple from the Bible how to overcome their problems. The couple were astonished at the practical counsel contained in the Scriptures, and they agreed to a Bible study. Their marriage was strengthened, they progressed spiritually, and they got baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> What You Can Say to an Atheist: </span><span class="font14">When someone tells you he is an atheist, endeavor to find out the reason why he says that. Is it because of the education he has received, the problems he has experienced, or religious hypocrisy and false teachings he has seen? You might ask him: “Have you always felt this way?” or “What is the reason for your conclusion?” His answer will help you determine what to say. Where powerful arguments are required, the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </span><span class="font14">may be just what is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>8</sup> You might pursue a conversation with an atheist by asking:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ “Have you ever wondered: ‘If there is a God, why is there so much suffering and injustice in the world?’ [Allow for response.] May I show you the Bible’s view on this subject?” Read Jeremiah 10:23. After reading it, ask his opinion of the text. Then show him pages 16 and 17 in the brochure </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Will There Ever Be a World Without War?</span><span class="font14"> Or, instead, you may use chapter 10 of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Creator</span><span class="font14"> book. Invite him to accept the publication and read the material.—For further suggestions, see the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font14"> book, pages 150-1.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>9</sup> Admittedly, not all atheists will accept the truth. But there are many who are willing to consider another viewpoint. Use logic, persuasion and, above all, the power of God’s Word to help them see the truth.—Acts 28:23, 24; Heb. 4:12.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah wants all people to benefit themselves. (Isa. 48: 17) He knows what brings us genuine happiness. His earnest desire is for humans to avoid calamity and to enjoy life by paying attention to his commandments. We are benefiting ourselves greatly by living our lives God’s way. (Ps. 34:8) How can we teach others to do the same?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> What Do People Want? </span><span class="font9">What concerns householders where you live? Is it not the security of their home, the strength of their marriage, the future of their children, and similar matters? When they have problems, where do they turn for help? They may rely on themselves, on self-help programs, or on the guidance of others. In the process, many are left bewildered by inconsistent and impractical ideas as to how to benefit themselves. We must convince them that what God’s Word offers in the way of guidance is far better. (Ps. 119: 98) We can do this by showing them how they can improve the quality of their lives even now if they make the effort to study the Bible and apply what it says. —2 Tim. 3:16,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Improved Family Life: </span><span class="font9">Few people realize how well the inspired counsel at Ephesians 5:22-6:4 works in resolving family problems. This was the case with a couple who, after ten years of marriage, decided that they would separate. However, a Bible study was started with the wife, who was taught Scriptural principles regarding married life. The husband soon noticed the changes she was making as she applied Bible principles, and he joined in the study. He later said: “Now we have found the basis for a really happy family life.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Real Purpose in Life: </span><span class="font9">When a young drug addict sought help from the Witnesses, he was taught that Jehovah cares about him personally. He said: ‘I learned that the Creator has a purpose for man and holds out everlasting life to those in his favor. You can’t imagine how happy I felt about this. Today I enjoy good health, peace of mind, and a close relationship with God.'</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> No one is beyond benefiting from the practical help found in God’s Word. By using it as our guide, we confirm that Jehovah’s way is far superior to the ways of the world. (Ps. 116: 12) It is our privilege to convey this message to others, teaching them to benefit themselves. As we do so, we will see many fine results.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s organization provides a regular program of theocratic activities designed to satisfy our spiritual needs. Appreciation moves us to take full advantage of everything arranged, such as visits of the traveling overseer, assemblies and conventions, and other special activities planned locally. (Matt. 5:3) However, some miss out on many of these spiritual provisions because of other commitments they have made. What can be done to prevent this? How can we make sure that nontheocratic activities do not crowd out “the more important things”?—Phil. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">-Wise Planning Is Essential: </span><span class="font9">Proverbs 21:5 admonishes: “The plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage, but everyone that is hasty surely heads for want.” To get the spiritual “advantage,” we need to plan ahead diligently, keeping in mind theocratic activities that have been arranged. We should schedule our personal activities for a time when they will not interfere with our being on hand to reap spiritual blessings. If we hastily make plans to do things we personally want to do, without giving thought to upcoming theocratic events, it is likely that we will suffer spiritual “want.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Do Not Miss Out! </span><span class="font9">All Of US make plans for the future, including for vacations, business trips, visits with relatives, and so forth. Before you commit yourself or finalize your plans, consult the schedule of upcoming spiritual activities. If you find that the circuit overseer is coming or that an assembly is scheduled at the same time you might be away, make an earnest effort to rearrange your affairs so that you can participate. We are informed well in advance about major events scheduled for the future. The elders in your congregation can tell you what has been planned locally.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> By exercising foresight and planning ahead for the more important things, we will be “filled with righteous fruit,... to God’s glory and praise.”—Phil. 1:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font8"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “God's Prophetic Word” District Convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-by-day review of the convention program should be assigned in advance to three qualified brothers, who will focus on outstanding points. This well-prepared review will help the congregation remember key points for personal application and for use in the field. Any comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> When the Israelites were about to enter the Promised Land, Moses entreated them to appreciate God’s instruction. He told them: “It is no valueless word for you, but it means your life.” (Deut. 32:45-47) Are we not grateful to Jehovah that our lives are so precious to him that he continues to guide us by means of his priceless Word? We therefore eagerly anticipate the three-day “God’s Prophetic Word” District Convention and what Jehovah has in store for us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> This year, district conventions are planned conveniently in 70 cities throughout the contiguous United States. Besides English and Spanish, the convention program will be conducted in American Sign Language, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. Additionally, for the first time in this country, the complete district convention program will be held in the Armenian and Russian languages, and sessions will be held in Polish.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> No doubt you have already made arrangements to attend every day of the convention because you believe that Jehovah expects you to be in attendance. Be assured that he sees the individual efforts and sacrifices that his servants make to attend, and he remembers such with appreciation. (Heb. 6:10) By attending each convention day from opening song to concluding prayer, we demonstrate to Jehovah that we value his words to us. (Deut. 4:10) We also show appreciation for the hard work of our many brothers involved in preparing for the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Arranging for thousands of God’s people to gather at each convention location requires advance planning and good organization. Knowing that convention arrangements have lovingly been made should move us to cooperate, so that “all things take place decently and by arrangement.” (1 Cor. 14:40) The following information and reminders are provided so that you may arrive at your convention fully prepared to enjoy the spiritual food and Christian fellowship.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">Plan to attend all day Friday, Saturday, and Sunday!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Before the Convention</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Do those with whom you conduct Bible studies and other interested ones need assistance in making personal arrangements to attend the convention? What they see and hear while there may move them to become worshipers of Jehovah. (1 Cor. 14:25) Elders should be aware of anyone requiring assistance with lodging or transportation, particularly older members of the congregation, and lovingly see that their needs are met.—Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Are your arrangements for accommodations finalized? If staying in a hotel, do you have a confirmation number and have you sent your deposit to the hotel? By now, any Special Needs Room Request forms approved by the Congregation Service Committee should have been mailed to the appropriate convention address by the congregation secretary. If you have been assigned accommodations under the special needs arrangement and you must cancel them, please inform the local Rooming Department immediately so that the accommodations can be reassigned. The address and telephone number can be found at the top of page 1 on the Recommended Lodging List for your convention.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> If you need information about a convention, the congregation secretary can provide you with the address of a specific location, as found on the back of the Special Needs Room Request form. Please do not phone or write the management of the convention facility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Since the First Aid Department at the convention is set up to handle emergency situations only, we recommend that you bring your own aspirin, bandages, inhalers, digestive aids, and similar items to the convention if you believe such may be needed. If you or a loved one has a serious existing condition, such as a heart problem, diabetes, or risk of seizures, please bring the necessary medication to the convention to care for these needs as though you were at home or on vacation. It would be wise for a family member or close friend who understands the situation to remain in the company of the person, since that one would be in the best position to provide the needed assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Opportunities to do informal witnessing will likely arise as you travel to and from the convention. Will you be prepared to share the truth with others? All of us, including young children, can be involved by offering tracts to gas station attendants, toll collectors, and others you meet in your travels. Opportunities will present themselves to place magazines, brochures, or other literature with interested ones. Be prepared to witness informally to people who may otherwise be missed by more conventional preaching methods.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">During the Convention</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10</sup> Doors will open at the conventidn site at 8:00 a.m. each day. You may save seats only for those in your immediate family or car group. Convenient seating will be reserved for elderly brothers and sisters, and areas will be set aside for the disabled and those requiring wheelchair access. It is not possible to set aside special rooms at the convention site for those who have environmental illnesses or allergies. Each day as you are leaving your seating area, please check to make sure that you have all your belongings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> In order to assemble in large numbers for our district conventions, we are required to comply with local laws, fire regulations, and other safety considerations. Therefore, baby strollers and lawn chairs should not be brought into the building where we are assembling. These are trip hazards in areas of foot traffic or between rows of seats. However, child safety seats that will fit into a seat next to the parents and can be secured there are acceptable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> Are you getting baptized at the district convention? For the Saturday morning session, a section of seats will be reserved for baptismal candidates, and the attendants will direct you to this location. If at all possible, please be seated there before the session begins. Bring along your Bible, songbook, towel, and a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">modest</span><span class="font10"> swimsuit. Cutoffs, T-shirts with slogans, and similar attire are inappropriate for such a dignified occasion. Elders reviewing the questions in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font10"> book with baptismal candidates should make sure that each one understands these points. Since baptism is a symbol of personal dedication to Jehovah God, it would be inappropriate for candidates to hold hands while being baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>13</sup> You may use cameras, camcorders, and audiocassette recorders at the convention. However, their placement or use should not block aisles, obstruct the view of others, or distract attention from the program. They must be self-contained —that is, not connected to the electrical or sound systems.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>14</sup> For those with impaired hearing, arrangements will be made for the convention program to be broadcast in the area of the convention site via FM radio. An announcement will be made at the beginning of the first session as to where on the FM broadcast band the program can be found. You will need to bring your own small FM receiver with earphones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>15</sup> As the use of cellular phones and pagers increases, please be careful that these devices do not interfere with either your attention to the program or the concentration of those seated around you. These devices should not be allowed to ring or beep audibly while you are seated in the audience. If it is necessary for you to use a cellular phone while the program is in progress, please do so outside of the auditorium.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>16</sup> In the interests of time and simplicity, the Society has asked us to bring our own lunches to the convention each day. Most brothers have followed this direction and have found that after being dismissed for the noon break, they can sit down with their families and eat what they have brought along for the day. Many have said that the opportunity to relax during the noon break and spend additional time with their brothers and sisters has been enjoyable. This requires purchasing foodstuffs and beverages ahead of time and packing them in a small container or cooler that can fit under the seat. We request that all in attendance follow this instruction. Lately, building managers and food vendors in the facilities where our conventions are held have observed some brothers leaving the auditorium to purchase food from street vendors and fastfood establishments nearby. Some of the food vendors in the convention facilities being used are now demanding that they be allowed to open their food stands and serve the delegates attending our conventions. If this were permitted, many worldly people would be mixing in company with us during the day. Also, congestion .and long lines around the concession stands would return, disturbing the relaxed atmosphere of our conventions. Therefore, we ask that each one endeavor to bring his own food and beverage to the convention each day. Interested ones accompanying you to the convention should also bring their own food. Glass containers and alcoholic beverages are not permitted in the convention facilities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>17</sup> Can you volunteer to help clean the facility after the sessions each day? Or can you work in one of the other convention departments? If you can assist, please come to the Volunteer Service Department at the convention. Children under 16 years of age are welcome to work along with a parent or another responsible adult. Of course, everyone can help clean the facility by seeing that any trash is picked up and disposed of properly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>18</sup> We have received fine guidelines as to what constitutes appropriate dress and grooming at our conventions. For example: We have direction on this matter in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> inserts, we have illustrations and pictures in our literature, and most important of all, we have what Jehovah says in the Bible. (Rom. 12:2; 1 Tim. 2:9, 10) People know who we are and why we have gathered in their city. Thus, our dress and grooming is a powerful witness in itself. The majority of Jehovah’s people set a good example in this area. Occasionally, though, we see the spirit of the world reflected in the dress and grooming of some who attend our conventions. Revealing clothing of any sort brings into question the individual’s claim to be a spiritual person. A modest, clean, neat appearance is what is most appealing. Family heads should, therefore, take note of what their family members are planning to wear. This would also apply when we are away from the convention site. Wearing our lapel badges before and after the day’s sessions further identifies us with Jehovah and his clean people.—Compare Mark 8:38.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>19</sup> Wise King Solomon was inspired to observe that “foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy” and “a boy let on the loose will be causing his mother shame.” (Prov. 22:15; 29:15) During the sessions, unsupervised younger Witnesses have caused disturbance to brothers and sisters trying to benefit from the program. During last year’s conventions, some young ones were found sitting in upper seating sections, sweeping laser pointers around the audience. The light from these pointers is intense and can cause eye damage, even at long range. It is obvious that these youths were not benefiting from the spiritual program that had been prepared with them in mind. Since parents are accountable to Jehovah for the conduct of their children, a mother or father can be confident that children are behaving and listening to Jehovah’s instruction only if the children are seated with them. Attendants will approach any who are causing a distraction and request that they desist from doing so, kindly reminding them to pay attention to the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>20</sup> Because we welcome the public to our conventions, it is wise to take precautions regarding children and personal belongings. Our children are a precious gift from Jehovah. But we know that the world reflects Satan’s predatory nature. Hence, please know where your children are at all times. Also, cameras, purses, and other valuables should be with you at all times and not be left at your seat. Make sure that your vehicle is locked, and place personal belongings in the trunk or take them with you. This reduces the temptation for someone to break into your vehicle.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>21</sup> The local Rooming Department is eager to assist you if a problem arises with your hotel reservation. Please inform the Rooming Department of any problems </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">while you are still at the convention.</span><span class="font10"> The brothers will be happy to help you resolve the matter so that you can continue to enjoy the convention. Also, in connection with rooming, please note the following;</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">■ Since many of Jehovah’s people are staying at hotels, it may not be possible for everyone to obtain a nonsmoking room, even if you requested this when you made your reservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ Please observe check-in and checkout times at the hotel where you are staying. If requested in advance, hotels may honor an early check-in or late checkout.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ It is becoming less and less safe to carry cash. It may be to your advantage to put restaurant or other charges on your room bill and pay for them when you check out of the hotel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">■ Television and video services available in hotels often provide access to channels that feature pornographic programs. If requested, most hotels will block out certain channels or features from your room for the duration of your stay. As at home, please supervise your children’s use of the television.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>22</sup> It is encouraging to see brothers and sisters taking notes during the convention sessions. Brief notes will help you concentrate and bring main points back to mind. Reviewing your notes later with family or friends allows you to meditate on convention highlights so that they are not forgotten.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>23</sup> Jehovah’s people have always been generous in contributing toward theocratic interests. (Ex. 36:5-7; 2 Chron. 31: 10; Rom. 15:26, 27) Your voluntary contributions toward the worldwide work are used to cover the expenses associated with renting the large facilities in which the conventions are held. If your contribution is made by check, please make it payable to “Watchtower.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>24</sup> As recorded at Amos 3:7, Jehovah said he “will not do a thing unless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants the prophets.” As the “Revealer of secrets,” Jehovah has had recorded in the Bible hundreds of prophecies that have been accurately and completely fulfilled. (Dan. 2:28, 47) Grand promises are yet to be realized. The 1999 “God’s Prophetic Word” District Conventions will strengthen your faith in God’s promises. Listen closely to Jehovah’s word for you. Apply what you will see and hear—in the ministry, in the congregation, and in your personal life. We pray Jehovah’s rich blessing on all your arrangements to attend every day of this rich, spiritual feast!</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Question box</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">■ Parents should exercise what cautions when their minor children share in field service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Christian parents properly take their children along with them in the field ministry, training them to share the Kingdom good news with others. In doing so, there is a need to keep a watchful eye on their young ones because of potential dangers in the territory, even in the “safer” neighborhoods. More and more, children are the objects of violence and abuse because of the increase of greed and sexual depravity in these “critical times” in which we live. (2 Tim. 3:1-5) Parents need to take reasonable precautions to safeguard their little ones from those who would prey upon them. What can be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Bible wisely counsels that we be cautious and look ahead to foresee danger. (Prov. 22:3; Matt. 10:16) The intent here is not to make rules, but it is wise for a parent or other adult to accompany a child when engaging in field service. If two responsible young publishers work together, it is advisable for a parent or another adult to have them in view at all times. Of course, as a child grows older and proves more responsible, parents can decide if he or she requires less direct parental supervision. —See also the October 1992 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> Question Box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is also wise to be ever mindful of safety while traveling by automobile and while walking about. Taking proper precautions often prevents accidents and the tragic burdens of pain, medical expenses, and possible legal liabilities in the increasingly litigious world around us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is fitting for young ones to “praise the name of Jehovah.” (Psalm 148:12, 13) Their winsome words and good behavior while in the field ministry are very impressive to others and bring honor to Jehovah. Parents, by all means, help your children to share regularly in proclaiming the good news as you are also ever alert to protect them from any potential dangers that exist!</span></p>

<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Over 40 years ago, an article entitled “Is Your Best Good Enough?” appeared in the January 15, 1955, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> It lovingly pointed out how it may be possible fob Jehovah’s people to improve their individual effort in the ministry so that they may increase their Kingdom activity.

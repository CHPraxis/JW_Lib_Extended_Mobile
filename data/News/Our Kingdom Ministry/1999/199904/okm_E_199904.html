<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “I am longing to see you . . . There is eagerness on my part to declare the good news also to you.” This is how the apostle Paul expressed himself at the beginning of his letter to the brothers in Rome. Why was Paul </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">eager</span><span class="font10"> to visit them? He said: ‘Tn order that I might acquire some fruitage also among you ... For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is, in fact, God’s power for salvation.”—Rom. 1:11-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Paul reflected this same </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">eagerness</span><span class="font10"> in speaking to the older men of Ephesus. He reminded them: “From the first day that I stepped into the district of Asia ..., I did not hold back ... from teaching you publicly and from house to house. But I thoroughly bore witness both to Jews and to Greeks.” (Acts 20:18-21) In all his assigned territory, Paul was intent on spreading the good news of salvation and gaining Kingdom fruitage. What a fine spirit to imitate!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> We might ask ourselves: ‘Do I show that same </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">eagerness</span><span class="font10"> in declaring the good news in my community? Rather than viewing the preaching work as just a duty, am I </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">eager</span><span class="font10"> to share the good news with as many people as possible? Have I prayerfully considered my personal circumstances? Have I explored all the possibilities that exist in our territory, such as preaching from door to door, on the street, in business districts, by telephone, and informally?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Share </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eagerly</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> During April: </span><span class="font10">The month of April is a good time to intensify our personal share in the preaching work. The reduced hour requirement should make it possible for more to auxiliary pioneer. Perhaps your circumstances will allow you to serve as an auxiliary pioneer during April and May. Or you may be able to enroll as a regular pioneer, in view of the adjusted hour requirement. If you are a congregation publisher, can you spend more time than usual in the service this month and next, lending support to those who are able to pioneer? That would make Jehovah’s heart glad!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Kingdom publishers should, like Paul, continue to manifest an </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">eagerness</span><span class="font10"> by reaching out in the preaching work. Doing all we can in the ministry will bring us real joy. Paul had this joy in his sacred service. We do well to imitate his excellent example. —Rom. 11:13; 1 Cor. 4:16.</span></p>
<div><img src="okm_E_199904_files/okm_E_199904-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:187pt;height:27pt;">

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The harvest season is a joyful time. It is also a time for hard work. There is only a limited time to gather the crops. The workers dare not loiter at their business.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Speaking figuratively, Jesus compared “a conclusion of a system of things” to a harvesttime. (Matt. 13:39) We are living in the conclusion of this system of things, with a limited time left for giving a witness “in all the inhabited earth.” (Matt. 24: 14) As the end draws ever nearer, we need to intensify our share in the ministry. Why? Jesus explained: “The harvest is great, but the workers are few.”—Matt. 9:37, 38; Rom. 12:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Be at It Urgently: </span><span class="font10">When Jesus started his grand preaching work, he had only three and a half years to accomplish what he was assigned to do. He preached with a sense of urgency, saying: “I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this I was sent forth.”—Luke 4:43.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Jesus instilled in his disciples a similar sense of urgency. (Mark 13:32-37) That is why “every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.” (Acts 5: 42) Less important activities did not take priority in their lives. As few as they were, they succeeded in preaching the good news “in all creation that is under heaven.”—Col. 1:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> There is even greater reason for us to cultivate that same sense of urgency now, as “the end of all things has drawn close.” (1 Pet. 4:7) Jehovah has set a day and hour for the end of this system of things. (Matt. 24: 36) The preaching work will be finished in the time that is left. That is why we continue to step up our efforts to reach more and more people with the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> By intensifying our share in the witness work as the end draws near, we will have the satisfaction of saying to Jehovah, as did Jesus: ‘We have finished the work you have given us to do.’ —John 17:4.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> ‘I’m already overloaded! Would it really be wise for me to take on pioneering at this time?’ So thought a sister as she listened to a pioneer-elder present a circuit assembly part entitled “Pressing Ahead With the Pioneer Ministry.” A young brother in the same audience thought, ‘How does he make room for pioneering? I’m not an elder, but my life is already packed with activity!’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> As the elder continued to discuss the blessings of pioneering, he interviewed several pioneers from the circuit who told of the adjustments that they had made in order to pioneer and how Jehovah richly blessed their efforts. One was disabled, one had an unbelieving mate, and one had given up a worldly career but was able to live within his means. Hearing how these pioneers were succeeding with Jehovah’s help, the brother and the sister in the audience began to reexamine their own thinking and circumstances. We invite you to do that too, especially since the reduced hour requirements for pioneers are now within the range of many more publishers of the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> We know that Jehovah is the Creator and Universal Sovereign ano that we owe our lives to him. (Dan. 4:17; Acts 17:28) It is clear to us that Jehovah is using just one organization. We are privileged to serve loyally with it, supporting “the faithful and discreet slave” in giving the Kingdom witness before the end comes. (Matt. 24:45; 25: 40; 1 Pet. 2:9) Living far along in “the last days,” we realize that the time in which to preach is running out. (2 Tim. 3:1) Meanwhile, we need to support our families materially. (1 Tim. 5:8) A person’s income does not seem to stretch as far as it did in the past. Perhaps our health is not what it used to be. And to be honest, we want to have a little time and some resources to spend on ourselves. (.Eccl. 3:12,13) So we may wonder if responding to the invitation to pioneer is really wise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> It is up to each one of us to examine our own circumstances carefully and to decide whether we can pioneer. (Rom. 14:12; Gal. 6:5) It is encouraging to note the increasing numbers who have responded to the call to pioneer. Despite the pressures and problems of these last days, the service report published in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1999 Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> shows that close to 700,000 of Jehovah’s people worldwide are pressing ahead in the pioneer ministry. Whether serving under difficult economic conditions, lacking transportation, experiencing health problems, or encountering other difficulties and hardships, these brothers and sisters are not tiring out in doing what is fine, and this is commendable. (Gal. 6:9) They have accepted Jehovah’s offer to put him to the test. (Mal. 3:10) They feel that pioneering is a very wise use of their limited time and resources and that Jehovah has truly blessed them for making the necessary adjustments to enter and remain in the pioneer work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Pioneers Are Being Blessed: </span><span class="font11">A sister in Cameroon who has a very young daughter explains: “Since her birth, my daughter has always accompanied me in the ministry. Even before she learned to walk, I carried her on my back, securely attached with a length of cloth. One morning in the ministry, I stopped at a roadside stand. My child left my side, taking with her several magazines from my bag. She toddled over to the next stand. Although she could not say much, she attracted the attention of a woman and presented a magazine. The woman was simply amazed to see such a young child sharing in this activity. She readily accepted the magazine as well as a home Bible study!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> In response to the call for more auxiliary pioneers, an elder and family head in Zambia who has a full-time secular job decided to auxiliary pioneer despite his tight schedule. He wanted to set an example for the congregation and for his family. On some occasions, he would park his car by the roadside and play </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret of Family Happiness</span><span class="font11"> on audiocassette and invite passersby to come over and listen to what was being read aloud. In that way, he was able to place 16 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font11"> books and 13 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> books, and he started two Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> A fine pioneer spirit was also noted in the neighboring country of Zimbabwe. During April 1998, one congregation with 117 publishers reported 70 auxiliary and 9 regular pioneers. Another congregation with 94 publishers had 58 auxiliary pioneers reporting. Still another, with 126 publishers, reported that 58 decided to auxiliary pioneer along with the 4 regular pioneers. Last service year proved to be an outstanding one in Zimbabwe. Even though the brothers there were very busy with family matters, congregation activities, and branch construction, they concentrated on spending their time wisely in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> Pioneers realize that getting started in the pioneer work and persevering in it are not dependent on their own strength. They are the first to admit that whatever they are able to do is possible because they are “dependent on the strength that God supplies.” (1 Pet. 4:11) Their faith enables them to carry on their ministry from day to day. Rather than seeking their own convenience and comforts, successful pioneers realize that to press ahead, “a great deal of struggling” may be required, but they receive many blessings as a result.—1 Thess. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Paul’s Example Bears Imitating: </span><span class="font11">The Bible records the apostle Paul’s accomplishments in the ministry and the fine help he gave so many people. Yet, if anyone was overloaded, Paul was. He endured persecution and physical hardships in order to preach the good news and to strengthen the congregations. He also had to put up with a severe health problem. (2 Cor. 11:21-29; 12:710) He was determined to spend his time wisely. He acknowledged that he did all his work with Jehovah’s help. (Phil. 4:13) None of those whom Paul assisted would have reason to conclude that his time and efforts in Jehovah’s service were wasted or could have been better spent. Why, we are still benefiting today from Paul’s wise use of his time! How we appreciate his inspired counsel to help us sort out our priorities and stick with the truth in these difficult times!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> Now as never before, ‘the time left to preach the good news is reduced.’ (1 Cor. 7: 29; Matt. 24:14) Therefore, it is appropriate to ask ourselves, ‘If my life were to end unexpectedly tomorrow, could I tell Jehovah today that I have used my time wisely?’ (Jas. 4:14) Why not talk to Jehovah in prayer now, assuring him of your desire to use your time wisely as one of his Witnesses? (Ps. 90:12) Pray for Jehovah’s help to simplify your life. Even though you might have ruled it out before, could it be that you now find that pioneering can be fitted into your life?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Make the Most of Your Circumstances: </span><span class="font11">Understandably, because of circumstances not all who so desire can schedule 70 hours a month to serve as regular pioneers. However, many publishers do arrange to devote 50 hours a month in the ministry as auxiliary pioneers as often as possible or continuously. If your circumstances are such that you presently cannot auxiliary or regular pioneer, take heart. Continue to pray that your circumstances will change. In the meantime, if adjustments are simply not possible, take comfort in knowing that Jehovah is well pleased with whatever you are able to do whole-souled in his service. (Matt. 13:23) He notes that you are standing firmly on his side and that you are striving hard to be a faithful publisher who never allows a month to go by without seizing opportunities to give a witness. Perhaps you can progress by sharpening your witnessing skills, working to excel as a preacher and teacher of the good news.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>12</sup> With “the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah” so near, we need to use the remaining time wisely if we are to finish the work we have been commissioned to do. (Joel 2:31) Satan knows that his time is short, and as never before, he is trying everything in his power to complicate our lives and make it difficult for us to concentrate on the truly important things. (Phil. 1: 10; Rev. 12:12) Never underestimate God’s interest in you. Jehovah can help you simplify your life and reach your full potential in the ministry. (Ps. 145:16) Happily, many are finding, in reexamining their circumstances, that they can join the ranks of the auxiliary or regular pioneers. Indeed, pioneers find deep satisfaction in using their time wisely. Will you be one of them?</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Have a Standing Order?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Have you ever gone to a meeting for field service and discovered that you had no magazines in your witnessing bag? Well, recall the September 1995 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font10">insert entitled “Make the Best Use of Our Magazines.” It told us to “have a definite magazine order,” stating: “Place a realistic order with the brother handling magazines for a definite number of copies of each issue. In this way, you and your family will have a regular and adequate supply of magazines.” Have you done this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Why not place a standing order for magazines? You will feel a greater responsibility to distribute the magazines week by week, and you will experience Increased Joy in doing so. If you already have a standing order, reevaluate whether you are obtaining the amount that you need for an average month in the ministry. Of course, we want to be faithful in picking up our order every week and should feel an obligation to do so. If you are going to be away from the congregation for an extended time, let the magazine servant know whether you want him to release your magazines to someone else until you return.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’The same insert quoted above also said that we should “schedule a regular magazine day.” Can you support the weekly Magazine Day? As shown on the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1999 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses,</span><span class="font10"> this is every Saturday of the year! Do not underestimate the importance of distributing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> When we make an effort to share fully in magazine activity, we are “bringing good news of something better” to our neighbors. —Isa. 52:7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> As a youth approaching adulthood, you might ask, ‘What should I do with my life?’ Christian youths want to expand their service to Jehovah in the ministry. But how can you do this while taking on the responsibilities of adulthood, which include providing for your own material needs? Finding the answer may not be easy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Some youths become anxious when they look at the world’s economic situation and the forecasts for the future. They wonder: ‘Should I pursue additional secular education? Should I enter the full-time service right away?’ In order to make the right decision, a person needs to answer this question honestly, ‘What is my foremost interest in life?’ He must examine his motives.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> What have you cultivated as your prime concern during your youth? Are you mainly interested in seeking financial advantage, or do you really want to use your life to advance Kingdom interests? A university degree does not guarantee success in the job market. As an alternative, many have acquired marketable job skills by means of apprenticeship programs, some vocational or technical school education, or short-term college courses that require a minimum of time and involvement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Take Jehovah at His Word: </span><span class="font10">An all-important fact to consider is the assurance from Jehovah God that he will provide for those who put Kingdom interests first in life. (Matt. 6:33) This is not an idle promise. Many brothers attending the Ministerial Training School earned college degrees prior to learning the truth. But what were they doing for secular work? Very few were pursuing the career for which they had been educated. Many were working in service-oriented fields, caring very well for their financial needs while pioneering. By expanding their activity in the ministry, they are receiving blessings far beyond anything monetary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> In deciding what you should do after graduation from high school, weigh all the factors and examine your motives carefully. For a balanced view of your choices, consider such information as appeared in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font10">of March 8, 1998, pages 19-21. Speak with your parents, the elders, your circuit overseer, and successful pioneers in your area. That will help you make a wise decision about what you should do with your life.—Eccl. 12:1, 13.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What could be more heartwarming than seeing husbands and wives, parents and children working together in the Christian ministry, publicly praising the name of Jehovah? (Ps. 148: 12,13) All families should have a good routine for regular participation in the field service. Does your family have a set day each week to spend in the ministry? If so, then everyone knows exactly what to plan for and can have a full share.—Prov. 21:5a.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In advance of a family service day. why not make it a joint project to prepare the presentations that your family will use? Practice sessions can be most helpful, and they can engender a true spirit of family cooperation. How rewarding it is when the field ministry is a family affair and all members are well prepared!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> A traveling overseer accompanied an entire family in the magazine activity. While he was working from house to house with one of the daughters, she inquired: “How long are you going to work with me?” Then she explained that she was going to work with her father next. It was obvious that she and her father really enjoyed their service together. What a fine family spirit!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Some families may be able to auxiliary pioneer together one month during the year. Or it may be possible for at least one member of the family to serve continuously as an auxiliary pioneer or even to enroll as a regular pioneer. With good organization and cooperation, perhaps all members of the household would be able to increase their personal share in the service by giving support to the one who is pioneering.

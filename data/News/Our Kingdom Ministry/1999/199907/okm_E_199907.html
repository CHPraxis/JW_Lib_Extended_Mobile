A thoughtprovoking news item that you heard or read about might give you an opening to start a conversation. Anticipate common objections that you are likely to encounter, and get a few thoughts in mind as to how you might respond. Then take a few minutes to practice what you are going to say at the door.</span></p>

(Ezek. 9:4; Zeph. 2:2, 3) Among them are ‘those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.’ (Acts 13:48) Our commission is to be disciple makers, teaching people all the things that Jesus commanded. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) While we may stir the initial interest of those we meet in the house-to-house work, while informal witnessing, and in street work, we make disciples In the follow-up ministry—on return visits and Bible studies.

<p><span class="font7">■ What publications should we study with new ones prior to their baptism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before a person can dedicate his life to Jehovah and get baptized, he must take in accurate knowledge. (John 17:3) He will obtain the information he needs by studying </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">both</span><span class="font7"> the brochure </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span><span class="font7"> and the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.</span><span class="font7"> In most cases the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font7"> brochure will be studied first. However, if the study was started in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font7"> book, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Require </span><span class="font7">brochure should be studied after the book is completed. Why is this necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font7"> brochure provides an overview of the basic teachings of the Bible. If studied first, it will give the student a fundamental understanding of the requirements for pleasing Jehovah. If studied last, it will serve as a fine review of what was covered in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font7"> book. In either case, encourage the student to look up the supporting scriptures and to meditate on them. Be sure to highlight the pictures, as they are very effective teaching aids.—See the January 15, 1997, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> pages 16-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Once a Bible student has completed a study of both publications, he may be able to answer all the questions that the elders will review with him in preparation for baptism. If so, it may not be necessary to conduct a formal study with him in any other publication, though the conductor should continue to take an active interest in his progress.—See the January 15,1996, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> pages 14,17.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">What practical benefits do you receive now from walking with Jehovah? How can you resist the temptation to allow nontheocratic pursuits to crowd Kingdom interests out of first place in your life? (Matt. 6:33) Do you find it difficult to discern right from wrong in a world that makes wrong appear right? (Heb. 5: 14) These matters will be addressed at the “Benefit Now by Walking in God’s Ways” circuit assembly, beginning in September 1999.—Ps. 128:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A new feature on Saturday of this circuit assembly will be the presentation of a model Service Meeting. Your circuit overseer will inform the congregations of what is planned so that all can come prepared to enjoy the program to the full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The part entitled “Pioneers —Keep Strict Watch on How You Walk”' will show us how to exercise wisdom and reasonableness in order to buy out the opportune time for the pioneer ministry. (Eph. 5:15-17) The subject “Beware of Ways That Merely Seem Right” will teach us how to make sure of what is acceptable to God in every aspect of life. The talk “How Fulfilled Prophecy Affects Us” will help to fill our minds and hearts with a love for God’s Word.

<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Have you ever had a we see today as well as their householder interrupt your outcome.” Read 2 Timothy 3: carefully prepared presenta- 1, 2, 5 and Proverbs 2:21, 22. tion with the words: “Whatfii^There is much concern in</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">do you want? Get to the point!” What can we learn from such an experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Many people today are impatient. They want to know who we are and why we are there. When they find out that the purpose of our visit is to discuss the Bible, they may close their minds. Bible reading and spiritual conversations are not important things in the lives of many people. How can we convince such householders that they should take a few minutes to discuss a Bible topic with us?</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> What Works Best: </span><span class="font8">The key is to show the householder that the Bible provides practical solutions for the problems that concern him and to do so in as few words as possible. The most effective presentations feature a specific question designed to make the householder think, followed by a scripture that answers the question. You may enjoy signed to help us “get to the point” quickly while arousing the interest of the householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> In territory where people often say that they are not interested, raise a question that involves them personally: ujA.s</span><span class="font8"> we approach the next millennium, do you feel hopeful or doubtful? [Allow for response.] The Bible predicted the unsettling events this country about health care. Did you know that God promises that he will permanently solve all health problems?” Read Revelation 21: 3, 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “How do you think our community would benefit if everyone who lives here applied Bible principles?” Read Matthew 22:37-39.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Since our commission is to preach the good netvs of the Kingdom, whenever possible we should call attention to what the Kingdom will accomplish. You might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">(■^Did you know that the world’s oldest book, the Bible, foretold that there will be one government for the whole world?” Read Daniel 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “What do you think conditions would be like if Jesus Christ ruled the earth?” Read Psalm 72:7, 8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> In territory where people are religious, you cotdd try one of these introductions: </span><span class="font8">criminatiop because of their gender, religion, or skin color. How do you think God feels about such prejudice?” Read Acts 10:34, 35.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “We know that Jesus Christ performed many miracles in his day. If you could ask him to perform one more miracle, what would it be?” Read Psalm 72:12-14, 16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup> If the householder is reluctant to open the door, you might start a conversation by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">j)‘Most people today are tired of hearing about problems. They want to hear about solutions. No doubt that is true of you. But where can we And real solutions to our problems?” Allow for response. Read 2 Timothy 3:16, 17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Why Not Try It? </span><span class="font8">Oftentimes a simple, concise question is all that is needed to arouse a householder’s interest. One woman who was formerly opposed invited two sisters into her home after one of them asked the question: “Can you identify the Kingdom that you pray for in the Lord’s Prayer?” The woman was intrigued by the question, and she accepted a Bible study. She is now a dedicated servant of Jehovah!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> When you are speaking to a householder, be genuine with your expressions. Speak from your heart. People are more likely to respond favorably when they are convinced that we are truly interested in them.—Acts 2: 46, 47.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup> The work of preaching the good news is a challenge today. Some householders are suspicious of strangers. Others lead hectic lives and have little time to spare. Yet, we can be sure that there are still many deserving ones to be found. (Matt. 10:11) Our efforts to search for them are likely to be more successful if we keep our presentations brief and “get to the point!”</span></p></li></ul>

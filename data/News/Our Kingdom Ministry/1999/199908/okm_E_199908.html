</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">‘Satan defamed God’s name when he induced our first parents to sin. The Devil insinuated that Jehovah had lied to Adam. (Gen. 3:1-5) Since the divine name is linked with God’s ability to fulfill his word, Satan’s allegation was the height of slander. By progressively fulfilling his divine purpose, Jehovah has cleared his name of reproach and made it beautiful. —Isa. 63:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> We are the people whom Jehovah has ‘called by his name.’ (Acts 15:14,17) This gives us the opportunity to show how we feel about its sanctification. We find Jehovah’s name to be truly beautiful, as it represents everything good, kind, loving, merciful, and righteous. We are filled with awe at the greatness of God’s glorious name. (Ps. 8:1; 99:3; 148:13) What should we be moved to do?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Sanctify God’s Name: </span><span class="font11">God’s name cannot be made holier than it already is. But by our clean conduct and Kingdom preaching, we can demonstrate that we hold God’s name in the very highest esteem. Let us exclaim: “Give thanks to Jehovah, you people! Call upon his name. Make known among the peoples his dealings. Make mention that his name is put on high.” (Isa. 12:4) How can we do this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> We can take advantage of every opportunity to proclaim Jehovah’s name and all that it stands for. Whether formally or informally, from house to house or from store to store, on the street or on the telephone, our preaching activity honors Jehovah. When we find interested ones who listen, we should make definite appointments to call back and teach them more about Jehovah. That means we must keep those appointments without fail and persevere in our efforts to start home Bible studies. Happily, every year hundreds of thousands are coming to know, respect, and sanctify Jehovah’s beautiful name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Our wholehearted participation in the work of sanctifying God’s name clearly shows where we stand on the issue Satan raised in Eden. This is the most noble, honorable work we can perform. Let us highly esteem and zealously praise Jehovah’s beauteous name!—1 Chron. 29:13.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Has the Door to Pioneering Now Opened for You?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Our 1999 yeartext reminds us that we are still within Jehovah’s “day of salvation.” (2 Cor. 6:2) But his day of salvation will soon end. Then his “day of judgment” will begin. (2 Pet. 2:9) While Jehovah continues to extend the opportunity for salvation to mankind, how thrilling it is to see ever-increasing numbers respond!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s people have risen to the challenge of reaching the responsive ones before it is too late. For many Kingdom publishers, this has meant entering the pioneer service. Has the door to pioneering now opened for you? Why do we ask?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Appreciation Expressed: </span><span class="font11">As announced in the January 1999 Our </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> the hour requirement for both regular and auxiliary pioneers has been reduced. To meet the new requirement, regular pioneers need to devote 70 hours to the ministry each month for a total of 840 hours per service year. Auxiliary pioneers will spend 50 hours in the service each month. Here are a few of the many expressions of appreciation that have been received as a result of these adjustments:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">“WTiaf </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a blessed gift from our heavenly Father!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“No words can convey the emotions of joy, love, and gratitude for this provision!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“It will make meeting our schedules so much easier!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Our prayer is that many more will now take up the full-time ministry and enjoy the blessings that come from serving Jehovah in a large way.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> As we approach the climax of God’s day of salvation, it is evident that Jehovah desires his people to give a final, mighty shout of praise. The magnitude and intensity of this message is increased (1) by the steady growth in the number of Kingdom proclaim-ers and (2) by each one’s seeking to Increase what he is able to do in Kingdom preaching. Jehovah, the one “who makes it grow,” has brought success in both ways by blessing the willing spirit of all who have accepted salvation.—1 Cor. 3:6, 7; Ps. 110:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Do Not Miss Its Purpose: </span><span class="font11">It was with respect to Jehovah’s day of salvation that Paul admonished fellow Christians: “Working together with him [Jehovah], we also entreat you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose.&quot; We will not “miss its purpose” if we see this as “the especially acceptable time” to work for the salvation of others at every opportunity. (2 Cor. 6:1, 2) Today, Paul’s words take on greater urgency. Christians manifesting a heartfelt love for Jehovah count it a privilege to share as fully as possible in the ministry that he has assigned them. Are you now able to share more fully in the ministry as a regular pioneer?</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">GOAL: 90,000 REGULAR PIONEERS!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> It Is a Reasonable Goal: </span><span class="font11">In the United States, it is our goal to see 90,000 regular pioneers enrolled by September 1. We believe that this is a reasonable and attainable goal. Why are we so confident? In March 1997 we saw 116,335 brothers and sisters auxiliary pioneer, and in April 1998 nearly 90,000 did so. The majority reported 60 hours —just 10 hours short of the new regular pioneer requirement! Even if only 15,000 of those who have auxiliary pioneered enroll as regular pioneers before the end of this service year, we could start September with 90,000 or more full-time pioneers!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> A Schedule Is Needed: </span><span class="font11">Does 70 hours of field service a month still seem a little out of reach for you? Perhaps thinking in terms of 17 hours a week will help. Using the sample schedules on the next page, try to create a regular pioneer schedule that will fit your personal circumstances. In working it out, talk with experienced pioneers to get their input on how they balance pioneer service with personal and family responsibilities. Ask your circuit overseer how pioneers in the circuit schedule their service activity each week. Then look to Jehovah to bless your plans to pioneer.—Prov. 16:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Make It a Family Project: </span><span class="font11">Have you considered making pioneering a family project? You might sit down as a family and discuss how—with careful planning and good cooperation—one or two members of the family may be able to pioneer. Understandably, some will find that an honest evaluation of their circumstances does not allow for regular pioneering right now. If so, set pioneering as a future goal. But start making plans to work toward a definite date to begin pioneering. Perhaps you can auxiliary pioneer several times during the year to work up to regular pioneer service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> The more than 75,000 regular pioneers currently on the list in the United States have varied circumstances. Not all are in the best of health, and the majority have family and financial obligations. Over 26,000 pioneers are past the age of 50, and about 10,000 of them are over the age of 65. Some 27,000 are single, and about 8,000 are 20 years of age or younger. Approximately one fourth of all the pioneers are brothers, many of whom have family and congregational responsibilities. All of these are “buying out the opportune time” for pioneering, which in many instances has meant living a simpler yet more contented life.—Col. 4:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Do You Need to Simplify? </span><span class="font11">Simplifying your life can be the key that opens the door to pioneering for you. Is your life like a large house with unnecessary rooms and furnishings, requiring much time, money, and work to care for? If so, adapting to more modest circumstances may allow for pioneering. Can you reduce the amount of time you spend in secular work? Can you buy out time from nonessential activity or show greater balance in the amount of time spent in recreation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>11</sup> The Bible, at 1 Timothy 6:8, admonishes us: “Having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.” Being content with less is an important factor in doing our utmost in Jehovah’s service and makes it easier to give priority to spiritual interests. (Matt. 6:22,33) On page 104 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1998 Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> in the report on Japan, several suggestions are offered as to why there is such a fine pioneer spirit in that land. Consider one: “It is generally true that Japanese homes are quite modest, thus requiring little time for upkeep, and for the most part, lives are traditionally kept simple.” Is that not the essence of 1 Timothy 6:8?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>12</sup> Around the globe, God’s servants are preaching the good news with ever-increasing intensity before Jehovah’s day of salvation comes to an end. Commendably, last year an average of nearly 700,000 shared in some form of pioneer service each month. Can you adjust your life in order to join them? We Invite you to carefully and prayerfully examine your circumstances as you answer the question: “Has the door to pioneering now opened for you?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">New Special Assembly Day Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">The special assembly day program beginning in September 1999 has as its theme: “Searching Into the Deep Things of God.” (1 Cor. 2:10) What valuable things will we learn?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In their quest for knowledge, many people are not refreshed by what they find. The Bible invigorates us, as will be shown by the circuit overseer in his part entitled “Searching God’s Word Brings Refreshment.” The visiting speaker will make the connection between searching into the deep things of God and preaching the good news as he addresses the question “How Do You View Kingdom Preaching?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How can parents help their children to dig deep into God’s Word? Practical suggestions will be provided in the part “Inculcate God’s Word in Your Children.” Christian youths are influenced in a wholesome way by association with spiritually mature ones in the congregation. Examples of how they are favorably affected will be highlighted in the portion “Youths Who Learn From Older Ones.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Why should we diligently search for hidden spiritual treasure at this time? Jehovah is a Revealer of secrets. The visiting speaker will explain what Jehovah has revealed in ancient and modern times in the talk “Jehovah Progressively Reveals Deep Things.” This will strengthen our resolve to continue “searching into the deep things of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Plan now to attend. Those who wish to symbolize their dedication to Jehovah by baptism should inform the presiding overseer as soon as possible. Our earnest desire to delve into God’s Word will be fortified by what we hear. So do not miss this special day of spiritual instruction!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>What Will You Say to a Buddhist?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In some lands more than half of those getting baptized are from a Buddhist background. What is attracting these ones to the truth? How can you present the good news to a Buddhist?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Show Genuine Concern: </span><span class="font11">Many former Buddhists have said that it was not profound reasoning that attracted them to the truth. Rather, they were touched by the genuine personal concern shown to them. An Asian woman living in the United States was so impressed with the friendliness of the sister who called on her that she agreed to study. She could not speak English well, but the sister was patient. When the woman was tired or unable to study, the sister would simply make a friendly visit and arrange for the next session. Eventually the woman, her two sons, and her aged mother got baptized. She returned to the land of her birth and assisted many others to learn the truth. One of her sons now serves at the branch office. What blessings resulted from reflecting Jehovah’s ‘kindness and love for man’!—Titus 3:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Buddhist Thought: </span><span class="font11">Buddhists generally are tolerant of other ideas, but they do not consider it necessary to adhere to specific dogma. So their individual beliefs vary. A common theme in one branch of Buddhist teaching is that life is full of suffering, but by means of enlightenment, one can stop the continuous cycle of rebirth into unsatisfactory lives. It is said that to be liberated from this cycle, one must achieve Nirvana, a state that cannot be described because it is not a place or an event but, rather, a void in which pain and evil are nonexistent. (See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">What Happens to Us When We Die?,</span><span class="font11"> pages 9-10.) What does this tell us? That it would be counterproductive to engage people in debates on Buddhist philosophy. Instead, discuss common problems that are of concern to all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Emphasize Mutual Interests: </span><span class="font11">Since Buddhists generally equate life on earth with suffering, the concept of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">everlasting </span><span class="font11">life on earth may strike them as absurd. Still, all of us share the desire to enjoy happy family life, to see suffering eliminated, and to know the meaning of life. Note how such mutual needs can be highlighted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> You might try this introduction:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Today we live in a world where many innocent people suffer. What do you believe is needed to bring an end to pain and misery for all? [Allow for response.] There is an ancient promise that is very comforting to me. [Read Revelation 21:4.] Of course, that time has not yet come, but when it arrives, we would like to see it, wouldn’t we?” Then offer a publication that explains how suffering will end.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> To an older person, you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Perhaps you are as concerned as I am about the current flood of degraded ideas and the effect that these are having on our children. Why is there such an increase in immorality among young people? [Allow for response.] Did you know that this was foretold in a book that started to be written long before the founding of the Muslim, Christian, and Hindu religions? [Read 2 Timothy 3:1-3.] Note that these conditions prevail despite continuous learning. [Read verse 7.] This publication helped me to understand the truth that most people never learn. Would you like to read it?” Offer an appropriate book or brochure.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Buddhists generally respect the Bible as a sacred writing. So read from it directly. (Heb. 4: 12) If the person feels uneasy about the influence of Western culture, mention to him that all of the Bible writers were Asians.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Which Publications Work Best? </span><span class="font11">Published especially for Buddhists, the tract </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Will Suffering Ever End?</span><span class="font11"> is printed in Chinese, Japanese, Sinhalese, and Thai. In addition, many publishers have successfully used the following literature: the books </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God, The Secret of Family Happiness,</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work; </span><span class="font11">the brochures </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Look! I Am Making All Things New,&quot;</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">What Is the Purpose of Life—How Can You Find It?;</span><span class="font11"> and, if still available, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> No. 35, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Will All People Ever Love One Another?</span><span class="font11"> Most Buddhists who are now learning the truth study the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font11"> brochure first and then the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Although Buddhist missionaries are said to have arrived in Athens nearly 400 years before Paul preached there, it is uncertain whether he ever met a person influenced by Buddhist thought. However, we do know how Paul felt about witnessing to people of all sorts. He made himself “the slave to all” so that he “might by all means save some.” (1 Cor. 9:19-23) We can do the same by showing personal interest in people and by emphasizing the hope that we hold in common as we witness to everyone we meet.</span></p></li></ul>

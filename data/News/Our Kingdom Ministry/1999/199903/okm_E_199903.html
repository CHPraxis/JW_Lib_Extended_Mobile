<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has showered us with many gifts. The sum total of his goodness and loving-kindness is eloquently described as “his indescr</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ibabl</span><span class="font10">e free gift.” Yes, the '^undeserved kindness of God” is so marvelous that to describe it surpasses our ability.—2 Cor. 9:14,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> His Greatest Gift: </span><span class="font10">Jesus Christ, as mankind’s Ransomer, is the greatest gift of all. In expressing his great love for the world of mankind, Jehovah gave his beloved and only-begotten Son. (John 3:16) Such an undeserved blessing from God deserves worldwide commemoration. When and how? On the evening of Thursday, April 1, 1999, Christians around the</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font10">world will commemorate the Lord’s Evening Meal, observing the Memorial of the greatest of all sacrifices.—1 Cor. 11: 20, 23-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’Christ died for us even “while we were yet sinners,” and we can show our personal gratitude by observing the Memorial of his death and by inviting others to be present with us on that all-important occasion. —Rom. 5:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> The Most Important Event: </span><span class="font10">The observance of Christ’s death highlights primarily that he upheld God’s sovereignty flawlessly. It also reminds us that we can enjoy a clean standing before Jehovah by exercising faith in Jesus’ sacrifice, thus be</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font10">ing assured of salvation. (Acts 4: 12) Truly, this is the most important event of the year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> Love for our neighbors is manifested in our inviting them to observe the Lord’s Evening Meal with us. The benefits of the ransom remain available to millions who learn of its excelling value. (Phil. 3:8) Those exercising faith in Christ’s sacrifice can gain the firm hope of everlasting life.—John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> The Memorial season provides special opportunities for us to show appreciation for the surpassing undeserved kindness of God. This is an excellent time to share zealously in preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom. Great benefits await all who reflect prayerfully on Jehovah’s indescribable free gift and arrange to be present at this year’s celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal!</span></p>

Last year in the United States branch territory, the peak attendance on Friday was 233,186 less than the peak attendance on Sunday. This means that over 16 percent of the total number attending on Sunday missed about one third of the convention program.

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>How Family Members Cooperate for a Full Share —In Congregation Meetings</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Christian families must heed the command to gather together at congregation meetings. (Heb. 10:24, 25) With good cooperation, all can succeed in preparing for, attending, and participating in the meetings. Family circumstances vary, but there are things that a Christian husband, a believing wife, or a single parent can do to promote family togetherness in spiritual matters, regardless of the number of children in the home and their ages.—Prov. 1:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Take Time to Prepare: </span><span class="font10">Family members cooperate to see that each one is suitably prepared for congregation meetings. Many consider the article for the weekly </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower </span><span class="font10">Study together. Some prepare for the Congregation Book Study or read the weekly Bible reading as a family. The objective is to get the main points in mind prior to attending the meetings. In that way, all will benefit more from what is heard and will be equipped to participate as there is opportunity. —1 Tim. 4:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Plan to Participate: </span><span class="font10">Everyone in the family should have the goal of declaring his hope before others by commenting at meetings. (Heb. 10:23) Does a family member need help or encouragement to do this? What assistance does each one need in preparing assignments for the Theocratic Ministry School? Wives appreciate it when their husbands take an interest and perhaps offer an idea for a fitting illustration or a practical setting. Parents need not feel that they should prepare parts for their young children. Doing so could stifle the children’s initiative. But parents can help their young ones and listen as they rehearse aloud.—Eph. 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Organize to Attend: </span><span class="font10">Children can be taught from an early age to be dressed and ready to leave for the meeting at a designated time. Family members should cooperate in caring for household chores so that there are no delays.—See the suggestions in the books </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness,</span><span class="font10"> page 112, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Young People Ask,</span><span class="font10"> pages 316-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Parents and children alike can reflect on the words of Joshua of old, who said: “As for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah.” Then be resolved to cooperate for a full share in congregation meetings. —Josh. 24:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Ministerial Servants Render Valuable Service</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “They have demonstrated themselves to be truly dedicated men whose faith has been made manifest in zealous Kingdom service and in helping others to be made firm in the faith.” So says </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry,</span><span class="font10"> on page 57, about ministerial servants. Indeed, the spiritual example set by our ministerial servants is worthy of Imitation. Working along with them and with the elders “makes for the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.”—Eph. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Ministerial servants perform a vital function in the congregation. Think of all their valuable services! They care for accounts, literature, magazines, subscriptions, and territories; they act as attendants, handle sound equipment, and help maintain the Kingdom Hall. They participate in the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting. Some of them may even give public talks or conduct some of the congregation meetings. Like members of the physical body, ministerial servants perform services that we need.—1 Cor. 12:12-26. '</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’Seeing ministerial servants cooperate harmoniously with the elders as part of one servant body with mutual respect and understanding encourages others to do the same. (Col. 2:19) By faithfully fulfilling their responsibilities week after week and by showing a personal interest in others, they contribute toward a spiritually progressive congregation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> What can we do to show our appreciation for the hardworking ministerial servants? We need to be familiar with their assigned duties and show a readiness to cooperate when our assistance is needed. By word or deed, we can let them know that their work is appreciated. (Prov. 15:23) Those who work hard in our behalf are deserving of sincere recognition.—1 Thess. 5: 12,13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> God’s Word establishes the role and qualifications of ministerial servants. (1 Tim. 3:8-10,12, 13) Their valuable sacred service is indispensable to the function of the congregation. Such men merit our continued encouragement, as they all have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” —1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li></ul>

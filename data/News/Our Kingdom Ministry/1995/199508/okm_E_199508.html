<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What Sort of Persons Ought You to Be?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup>A time of accounting draws near for all mankind. The Bible calls it &quot;the day of Jehovah.&quot; It is the time when divine Judgment will be executed against the wicked; it is also a time of deliverance for the righteous. All persons then alive will be called to account for the way they have used their lives. With that in mind, Peter raises a probing question: “What sort of persons ought you to be”? He stresses the Importance of ‘holy acts of conduct, deeds of godly devotion, and keeping close in mind Jehovah’s day,’ as well as the need to be 'spotless, unblemished, and in peace.’—2 Pet. 3:11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup>Holy Acta of Conduct and Deeds of Godly Devotion: </span><span class="font8">Holy conduct Includes exemplary works that show respect for Bible principles. (Titus 2:7, 8) A Christian must avoid worldly conduct that is motivated by selfish, fleshly desires.—Rom. 13:11,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> “Godly devotion” is described as “a personal attachment to God, springing from a heart stirred by a deep appreciation for his appealing qualities.” Our zeal in the ministry is an outstanding way that we manifest this quality. Our motive In preaching goes beyond a mere sense of duty, it springs from a deep-seated love for Jehovah. (Mark 12:29,30) Being motivated by such love, we view our ministry as a meaningful expression of our godly devotion. Since our devotion must be constant, our share in the preaching work should be consistent. It should be an integral part of our weekly schedule of activity.—Heb. 13:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘Keeping Jehovah’s day “close in mind” means keeping it foremost in our daily thoughts, never relegating it to a place of insignificance in the background. It means keeping Kingdom Interests first in our lives.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Spotless, Unblemished, and In Peace: </span><span class="font8">As part of the great crowd, we have ‘washed our robes and made them white in the Lamb’s blood.’ (Rev. 7:14) Being “spotless” means, then, that we must steadfastly guard against our clean, dedicated lives being sprinkled with impurities from the world. We keep ourselves “unblemished” by refusing to let ungodly, materialistic pursuits disfigure our Christian personality. (Jas. 1:27; 1 John 2:15-17) We demonstrate that we are living “in peace” by reflecting “the peace of God” in all our dealings with others.—Phil. 4:7; Rom. 12:18; 14:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> If we successfully guard against worldly contamination, we will never be “fashioned after this system of things,” which has been condemned by Jehovah. Rather, our fine works will help others seethe distinction “between one serving God and one who has not served him.” —Rom. 12:2; Mal. 3:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Most of us have attended the “Joyful Pralsers” District Convention, and the refreshing spiritual food has undoubtedly intensified our desire to demonstrate our godly devotion. Many new ones share this desire. We can be a blessing by helping them to participate in field service during August.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’Jehovah’s name is magnified, the congregation is strengthened, and others are benefited when we conscientiously maintain “fine works.” (1 Pet. 2:12) May we always be that sort of person.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christian Conduct in School</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> If you are a Christian youth still in school, you need strong faith to keep your integrity. You are being exposed to bad associates and to situations that can test your faith. It is important that you apply Peter's counsel to “maintain your conduct fine among the nations, that . . . they may as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses glorify God.” (1 Pet. 2:12) You need courage and determination to meet this challenge.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> In or out of school, you are bombarded by the contaminating influences of premarital sex, obscene language, tobacco, and abuse of drugs. Every day, you encounter temptations that threaten to corrupt your record of good conduct. Like adults, you must “put up a hard fight for the faith” if you are to endure such trials.—Jude 3; see July 15, 1991, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Waichtower,</span><span class="font8"> pages 23-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> At school, there are patriotic ceremonies and worldly holidays. Do you know what national and religious holidays are promoted in your school? If a challenging situation arises, could you “hold a good conscience, so that . . . they may get ashamed who are speaking slightingly of your good conduct”? —1 Pet. 3:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">‘ You may be tempted by the lure of school sports activities or social gatherings. You must be alert to recognize how these seemingly enjoyable activities can compromise your faith. There is a need to choose associates with whom you can enjoy “an interchange of encouragement,&quot; each one being built up through the other’s faith—Rom. 1:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">’You Can Endure, With Jehovah’s Help: </span><span class="font8">Satan is constantly testing your faith. The trials you must endure can be severe, but the rewards make it all worthwhile. (1 Pet. 1:6, 7) You cannot successfully endure on your own; you must look to Jehovah for help. Jesus urged his disciples: “Keep on the watch and pray continually, that you may not enter Into temptation.” (Matt. 26:41) Discipline and self-control are vital.—1 Cor. 9:27.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Always remember that you are accountable to Jehovah for your conduct. (Eccl. 11:9) Even though what you do may not be observed by others, Jehovah is aware of what you do and will render judgment. (Heb. 4:13) A sincere desire to please him should move you to ‘work out your salvation with fear and trembling.' (Phil. 2:12) Reading God’s Word dally Is a great help. It is filled with excellent counsel and fine examples to Imitate. —Heb. 12:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Parents, you play a vital role. You need to supervise your children, be aware of problems they face, and provide help when it is needed. Do you have a good rapport with your children? Have you Inculcated in them an appreciative understanding of God’s laws and principles? When faced with pressures or temptations, are your children strong, or do they give up easily? Do they get discouraged because they have to be different from their peers? As parents, you have the responsibility to help them. (Deut. 6:6,7) If you do your job well, you can help them be victorious in the fight for the faith.—Prov. 22:6.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Parents Who Rejoice!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> If you are a young person living in a Christian home, there is a special way you can make your parents happy. If you pursue a righteous course, “your father and your mother will rejoice.” (Prov. 23:22-25) Your parents naturally want the best for you. Nothing could please them more than to see you make the truth your own and dedicate your life to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> You can be thankful to have parents who are in the truth. From your birth, they have fed, clothed, and housed you as well as nursed you through times of sickness. Even more Important, they have endeavored to teachyou about Jehovah and his righteous ways; this is training that can ensure your everlasting life. (Eph. 6: 1-4) How can you show your appreciation?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Make th* Truth Your Own: </span><span class="font8">Your parents have tried to teach you to take the truth seriously, make spiritual progress, and keep close to Jehovah's organization. You can show appreciation by taking an interest in the family study without having to be coerced. Demonstrate a desire to attend meetings, taking the initiative on your own to get ready so that the family can arrive on time. Sit with your parents during the meetings, and pay close attention by following along in the publications being studied. Reach out for a share in the meetings by commenting. Show yourself to be a willing student in the Theocratic Ministry School, accepting assignments and doing your best to fulfill them. Volunteer to help care for tasks around the Kingdom Hall, where your assistance would be useful. Involvement in such activities can keep your heart focused on what is good for you spiritually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Set Progressive Goals: </span><span class="font8">Reach out for a meaningful share in field service, showing a desire to qualify as a publisher. Keep up with the weekly Bible reading or, even better yet, read the entire Bible on your own. Make up your mind that you are going to meet the requirements for dedication and baptism. Your parents can help you to plan your curriculum in school carefully, with a view toward acquiring training that will equip you for a full share in Jehovah’s service. Concentrate on developing the kind of reputation that will prompt others to recommend you for special privileges such as pioneering or Bethel service. (Acts 16:1,2) Achieving goals can help you “make sure of the more important things, so that you may be ... filled with righteous fruit.&quot;—Phil. 1:10,11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Youth is a time to leant, to gain experience, and to acquire skills in dealing with others. It is a time when you can eqjoy life without all of the pressures and responsibilities that come with adulthood. Solomon said: “Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart do you good in the days of your young manhood.&quot; (Eccl. 11:9) If you set your heart on serving Jehovah in your youth, you will reap blessings that will last forever.—1 Chron. 28:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> If you “pursue righteousness” instead of “the desires incidental to youth,” you will relieve your parents of a heavy burden of anxiety and heartache. (2 Tim. 2:22) You will give your own heart cause to rejoice. (Prov. 12:25) Most of all, you will bring joy to your Creator, Jehovah God.—Prov. 27:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Offering Ourselves Willingly for Every Good Work</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> A worldly publication made reference to Jehovah’s Witnesses, saying: “It would be difficult to find members of any other group who work as hard at their religion as do the Witnesses.’’ Why do Jehovah’s Witnesses work so hard and with such a willing spirit?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> One reason is that they are Imbued with a sense of urgency. Jesus recognized that he had a limited time in which to finish his work on earth. (John 9:4) While the glorified Son of God goes subduing in the midst of his enemies today, Jehovah’s people realize that they have a limited time to do their work. Therefore, they keep offering themselves willingly for sacred service. (Ps. 110: 1-3) With more workers needed to bring in the harvest, there can be no letup in their efforts. (Matt. 9:37, 38) Hence, they endeavor to imitate Jesus, who set a perfect example of willingness and diligence in his work. —John 5:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’Another reason Jehovah’s Witnesses work whole-souled as to Jehovah is that their worldwide organization is different from all other groups. Worldly religious organizations typically require only a minimum of time and effort from their adherents. What they believe has little or no effect on their daily lives, their dealings with others, or their pursuits in life. Lacking the motivating power of true faith, they have insisted that their shepherds ‘speak to them smooth things,’ assuring them that their token effort is sufficient. (Isa. 30:10) Their clergy have obliged by ‘tickling their ears,' instilling a spirit of apathy and spiritual laziness.—2 Tim. 4:3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> What a contrast among Jehovah’s people! Everything about our worship involves effort, exertion, and work. Every day and in everything we do, we practice what we believe. While the truth brings us much Joy, it involves “a great deal of struggling” for us to fulfill what it requires. (Compare 1 Thessalonians 2:2.) Just caring for the responsibilities of daily living is enough to keep most people busy. However, we do not allow these concerns to prevent us from putting Kingdom interests first.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> What we are given to do in Jehovah’s service is so beneficial and urgent that we are moved to ‘buy out’ time from other pursuits and use it more profitably on spiritual matters. (Eph. 5:16) Knowing that our godly devotion and willing spirit please Jehovah, we have the greatest incentive to keep on with our hard work. With the rich blessings we receive now and prospects of the life to come, our determination is to continue “working hard and exerting ourselves” in behalf of Kingdom interests.—! Tim. 4:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Devotion and the Spirit of Self-Sacrifice: </span><span class="font8">Most people today give material needs and interests priority over everything else. They feel fully Justified in focusing attention on what they will eat, drink, or wear. (Matt. 6:31) Not being content with necessities, they are motivated by the goal of enjoying good living to the full now and ‘having many good things laid up for many years, so they can take their ease, eat, drink, and enjoy themselves.’ (Luke 12:19) The typical churchgoer feels that any personal effort required by his religion is an encroachment upon his rights. The idea of abandoning or even curtailing some materialistic pursuit or giving up a pleasurable interest is repugnant. With his thinking centered upon himself, cultivating a spirit of selfsacrifice is unreal, impractical.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> We view this matter differently. God’s Word has elevated our thinking so that we think God’s thoughts instead of those of men. (Isa. 55:8, 9) We have goals in life that transcend fleshly pursuits. The vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty and the sanctification of his name are the most important issues in the entire universe. The magnitude of these Issues is so great that, in comparison, all the nations “are as something nonexistent in front of him.” (Isa. 40:17) Any attempt to live our lives in a way that ignores God’s will must be viewed as foolishness.—1 Cor. 3:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> So while some material things are needed and others are useful in carrying on our Kingdom activities, we perceive that these are not really “the more important things.” (Phil. 1:10) We adhere to the spirit of 1 Timothy 6:8 in limiting our pursuit of material interests and wisely endeavoring to keep our hearts focused on ‘the things unseen that are everlasting.’—2 Cor. 4:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>9</sup> The more we think God’s thoughts, the less anxiety we have about material things. When we contemplate what Jehovah has done for us already and the marvelous blessings he has promised for the future, we are willing to make any sacrifice he asks of us. (Mark 10:29, 30) We owe our very existence to him. Were It not for his mercy and love, we would have no enjoyment of life now and no future whatever. We feel obliged to give of ourselves, since everything we are doing in his service ‘is what we </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ought</span><span class="font8"> to be doing.’ (Luke 17:10) Anything we are asked to give back to Jehovah, we part with cheerfully, knowing that we will “reap bountifully.”—2 Cor. 9: 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Willing Workers Are Needed Now: </span><span class="font8">From its very beginning, the Christian congregation entered into a period of intense activity. A thorough witness had to be given before the overthrow of Jerusalem in 70 C.E. During that time Jesus’ disciples were “intensely occupied with the word.” (Acts 18:5) Rapid expansion made it necessary to train more evangelizers and skilled shepherds and to enlist their help. Men with experience in dealing with secular authorities as well as capable ones able to supervise the collection and distribution of material things were needed. (Acts 6:1-6; Eph. 4:11) While a few served prominently, most remained in the background. But all of them ‘exerted themselves vigorously,’ working together wholeheartedly to get the work done. —Luke 13:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>11</sup> Although there was relatively little need for vigorous activity on a worldwide scale during the many centuries that followed, a great revival of Kingdom activity began when Jesus took his Kingdom power in 1914. At first, few realized that the need for workers in behalf of Kingdom interests would become so great, requiring the help of millions of willing ones in lands all around the globe.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, AUGUST 1995</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>12</sup> Today the organization is deeply involved in a great variety of projects that have taxed our resources to their limits. Kingdom activity is moving ahead on a grand scale. The urgency of our times moves us to exert ourselves and to use every asset at our disposal to accomplish the work at hand. With the end of the entire wicked system of things drawing so near, we anticipate even more Intense activity in the days ahead. Every dedicated servant of Jehovah is being called upon to offer himself willingly in the urgent ingathering work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> What Needs to Be Done? </span><span class="font8">We can truthfully say that there is “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.&quot; (1 Cor. 15:58) In many territories the harvest is ripe, but the workers are few. We are invited to do our part not only in being more thorough in witnessing throughout our own territory but also In meeting the challenge of serving where there is a greater need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>14</sup> It is commendable to see how Witnesses in all parts of the world offer themselves willingly for other activities. These may range from volunteering in the construction of places of worship, serving at conventions, and assisting with relief efforts in times of disaster to cleaning the local Kingdom Hall on a regular basis. In connection with the latter activity, there Is the matter of always making sure the Kingdom Hall is left in a clean and orderly condition after each meeting. Completing tasks that may be considered menial demonstrates a proper understanding of Jesus’ words at Luke 16:10: “The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much, and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Giving Support to the Activities of the Congregation: </span><span class="font8">While each congregation functions as part of the overall organization and receives direction from “the faithful and discreet slave,&quot; it is made up of individual Kingdom publishers. (Matt. 24:45) Its accomplishments depend largely on how much each Witness is willing and able to do. The congregation focuses on getting the good news preached in its territory, making new disciples, and then strengthening them spiritually. Each one of us can contribute toward this work. We can also set goals for ourselves in personal study, meaningful participation in the meetings, and assistance to others in need within the congregation. These activities offer many fine opportunities for us to demonstrate our willingness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Taking the Lead In Position* of Oversight: </span><span class="font8">Jehovah has entrusted the supervision of each congregation to its appointed elders. (Acts 20:28) These are men who have reached out In order to qualify for this privilege. (1 Tim. 3:1) Virtually every brother in the congregation has some potential for qualifying for greater responsibilities. Many brothers are developing spiritually and need to keep growing under the guidance and loving assistance of the congregation elders. These men should be diligent students of the Bible and our publications. They can demonstrate their willingness by being submissive to the spirit-appointed elders, imitating their faith, and cultivating the qualities looked for in overseers.—Heb. 13:7, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Taking Up th* Full-Time Service: </span><span class="font8">The congregation functions primarily to preach the good news. (Matt. 24:14) What a blessing when zealous ones intensify their efforts by enrolling as pioneers! This usually involves making adjustments in their personal life. Additional adjustments may be required for them to continue in this special field of service. But those who hold on to this privilege instead of giving up after a year or so because of some temporary discouragement are sure to experience Jehovah’s rich blessing. Loving elders and other mature ones can contribute to the success of the pioneers, encouraging them by word and deed. What a fine spirit is demonstrated by young people who go directly into the pioneer work upon finishing school! The same is true of adults who enroll as regular pioneers as soon as their secular obligations are reduced. What satisfaction it brings to a dedicated Christian when he thus cooperates with Jehovah’s speeding up of the ingathering work.—Isa. 60:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Sharing In th* Construction and Maintenance of Meeting Places: </span><span class="font8">Literally hundreds of modem Kingdom Halls as well as many Assembly Halls have been constructed. Amazingly, almost all the work has been done by our brothers and sisters who have willingly volunteered their time and skills. (1 Chron. 28:21) Thousands of willing workers keep these facilities in good repair by performing whatever tasks may be required. (2 Chron. 34:8) Since this work is one aspect of sacred service, those assisting offer themselves willingly, not asking to be reimbursed for their service in this regard, any more than they would ask to be paid to preach from house to house, give public talks in the congregation, or help with assembly or convention work. These volunteers freely offer their services in planning and constructing places of worship to Jehovah’s praise. They eagerly assist with such things as completing legal documents, keeping records of accounts, making purchasing contacts, and calculating the amount of materials needed. These loyal servants of Jehovah do not add some type of overhead charge or in any way seek to profit materially either directly or indirectly from services they render, since all their talents and resources are dedicated to Jehovah. (See February 1992 Our </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font8"> page 4, paragraph 10.) This activity requires diligent workers who perform their services “whole-souled as to Jehovah.”—Col. 3:23.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>13</sup> What is it, then, that makes the willingness of Jehovah’s people unique? It is the spirit of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">giving.</span><span class="font8"> Their generous giving involves more than money or material things—they “offer </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">themselves</span><span class="font8"> willingly.” (Ps. 110:3) This is the essence of our dedication to Jehovah. We are rewarded in a special way. We experience “more happiness&quot; and we “reap bountifully” because what we do is appreciated by others, who give to us in return. (Acts 20:35: 2 Cor. 9:6; Luke 6:38) Our greatest Benefactor is our heavenly Father, Jehovah, who “loves a cheerful giver.” (2 Cor. 9:7) He will repay us a hundredfold, with blessings that will last forever. (Mal. 3:10; Rom. 6:23) So when privileges in Jehovah’s service are made available to you, will you volunteer yourself willingly and answer as did Isaiah: “Here I am! Send me”?—Isa. 6:8.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Why should we declare the good news without letup? What are the requirements for being a preacher of the good news? How can even shy or timid ones take the initiative in sharing the good news with others? These and other thought-provoking questions will be answered in the special assembly day program starting in September, with the theme “Qualified as Ministers of the Good News.” —Compare 2 Corinthians 3:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> As Jehovah’s people, we must be circumspect about our behavior. Encouraging experiences will be given by young people who will relate how they have resisted peer pressure. Parents will be provided with loving encouragement regarding the need to train their children as ministers of God. All of us will be helped to appreciate the necessity to preach and the blessings that accrue both to ourselves and to those who listen to us.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Surely the baptism will be a highlight of the day. Prior to this event, a The congregation secretary should meet with the literature servant early in August and set a date for taking inventory of the congregation's stock of literature at the end of the month. An actual count must be made of all literature in stock, and the totals are to be entered on the Literature Inventory form. The total number of magazines on hand can be obtained from the magazine servant. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Please mail the original to the Society no later than September 6.</span><span class="font8"> Keep a carbon copy for your files. The third copy may be used as a work sheet. The inventory should be supervised by the secretary, and the completed form should be checked by the presiding overseer. The secretary and the presiding overseer will sign the form.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ Congregations should begin requesting the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">1996 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span><span class="font8"> with their September literature request. The calendars will be available in Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Ukrainian.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Bible-based talk will be directed specifically to newly dedicated persons. Of course, all present will want to pay careful attention as the subject of baptism is discussed and its meaning made clear. Any who desire to be baptized at the special assembly day should make this known to the presiding overseer well in advance so that he will have sufficient time to arrange for elders to review the designated questions with baptismal candidates.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Another highlight will be the principal talk delivered by a guest speaker. It is entitled “Qualified and Equipped as God’s Ministers.” Four main provisions that equip us as ministers will be discussed, and the talk will include faith-building experiences.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Plan now to be in attendance for the entire program. Be sure to invite interested persons and Bible students so that they too can benefit from this day of theocratic education. In this way we can make sure that we are “adequately qualified” as ministers of the good news. congregation literature requests will be processed for shipment or for pickup during those days.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Teachers of God’s Word —Using Brochures</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Every dedicated servant of Jehovah has a responsibility to share in the work of teaching the Word of God to others. The seriousness of this responsibility becomes clear when we appreciate that it is the one with all authority in heaven and on the earth who has given us the commission to “make disciples of people of all the nations, . .. teaching them.” (Matt. 28:18-20) So, sharing in the preaching of the good news requires that we become teachers!—2 Tim. 2:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> During August we can use our teaching skills when offering brochures. We can pick out some interesting Scriptural thoughts in them and prepare a few comments that will help us get a conversation started.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> When offering the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “We have called on many of your neighbors and found that they are concerned about the sharp increase in crime, terrorism, and violence. In your opinion, why has this become such a problem? [Allow for response.] It is of special Interest to us that the Bible predicted this would happen. (Read 2 Timothy 3:1-3.] Note that this is to take place In ‘the last days.’ This implies that something Is about to come to an end. What do you think it is?” Allow for response. Turn to page 22, point out the illustration, and discuss one or two scriptures quoted on that page. Make arrangements to return later to explain why we believe these blessings are near at hand.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> You might like to use this approach tvhen offering the brochure “What Is the Purpose of Life—How Can You Find It?”:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Many people experience difficulty in trying to find a real purpose In living. While a few enjoy some limited happiness, most live Ilves that are filled with disappointment and suffering. Do you think this Is the way God intended for us to live? [Allow for response.] The Bible shows that God wants us to live in a world like this.” Point to the illustration on page 21, and then turn to pages 25 and 26. paragraphs 4-6, and explain what he has promised. Raise this question for discussion when you return: “How can we be sure that God will fulfill his promises?”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> You might offer the brochure “Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!” by displaying the full picture on the front and back covers and asking:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Would you like to live in a world full of happy people like this? [Allow for response.] The Bible tells us that God loves people and wants them to live forever In happiness on this earth.” Turn to picture number 49, and read one of the cited Scripture texts. Then, point to picture number 50, and explain what we must do if we want to live in this Paradise. Offer to return and discuss why faith in Jesus Christ is so important.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah is pleased when we make our ‘advancement manifest by paying attention to our teaching.' (1 Tim. 4: 15,16) Our brochures can be a real help to us in our efforts to assist those who yearn to hear “good news of something better.”—Isa. 52:7.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Successful Return Visits Require Effective Teaching</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Return visits are an important and joyful part of our field ministry. Why should we be diligent to call back on interested ones? Jehovah’s name is made known and is honored by this disciplemaking work, and God-fearing ones are helped to find the way to life. (2 Cor. 2: 17-3:3) Recognizing that both the sanctification of Jehovah’s name and the lives of others are involved should move us to prepare well before going back.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> A good teacher will help the student build on the foundation already laid. Just as a schoolteacher builds on the knowledge students gain from day to day, we should usually follow up our Initial call with further comments on the same subject. This makes for continuity of thought and for progressive thinking.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> HTten </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">you return after placing the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” you may find this effective:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “On my previous visit, we were discussing ‘the last days’ mentioned in the Bible and what that means for us. You may wonder how we know that we are living in the last days. (2 Tim. 3:1) Jesus’ disciples were anxious to get the answer to that question. [Read Matthew 24:3.] In his reply, Jesus described conditions that we see about us today. These include distress and violence as never seen before.&quot; Point out the feature of the sign discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4 on page 19. If the response is good, point out other features of the sign in paragraphs 5 to 8 on page 20. Offer to return and answer the questions raised on the front of the brochure.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> lb </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">follow up interest in the brochure “What Is the Purpose of Life —How Can You Find It?” you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “I have been anxious to resume our conversation about our purpose in living. I think we both agree that God intended for us to live on this earth in happy and peaceful conditions rather than in the turmoil we experience today. Do you think he will fulfill his promise?” Allow for response. Read Isaiah 55:11, and then discuss the thoughts in paragraphs 25 to 27 on page 30. Recommend a personal Bible study as the best way to find a worthwhile purpose in life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> To follow up previous interest shown in the brochure “Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!” you could display it again and say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “We talked about the beautiful world depicted on the cover of this brochure. I want to tell you why faith in Jesus Christ is so important to people who want to live there.” Turn to picture 41, and read Isaiah 9:6. Refer to picture 62, and read John 3:16, stressing the need for obedience. Explain that Jehovah’s Witnesses are helping people learn how to exercise faith by studying the Bible and trying to live by its counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“After each return visit, analyze it with a view to Improving your effectiveness. Ask yourself: Did I have something definite in mind to say? Did I keep attention focused on the Bible? Did I build on the foundation laid on the initial call? Was my presentation designed to lead Into a Bible study? Positive answers give assurance that you are striving to be a good teacher of God’s Word.</span></p>

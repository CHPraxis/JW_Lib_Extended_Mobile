<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Thankful for Wha</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “God recommends his own love to us In that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; (Rom. 5:8) How thankful all of us should be for the supreme sacrifice made both by Jehovah God and by his Son in our behalf! By means of Christ’s shed blood, we are given the opportunity for everlasting life, something that no human can give us.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> How can we show our appreciation? There are many people who are thirsting for true knowledge, which can only be found In God’s Sacred Word. It is Jehovah’s will that they come to a knowledge of the truth. (1 Tim. 2:4) We show our appreciation for the truth by ‘declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God.’ (Luke 4:43) Wholehearted participation in this work shows that we appreciate that Christ died for us and that we want to imitate him by faithfully obeying his command to make disciples of others.—Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> What are some avenues of preaching open to us? Is it possible for us to enroll as auxiliary pioneers from time to time? After counting the cost, some may be able to take up the regular pioneer service. By taking advantage of these fine opportunities, we can increase the amount of time we spend in spreading the Kingdom good news. In times past you may have considered enrolling, but there were obstacles. Perhaps your circumstances have changed. If so, have you given serious thought to entering the pioneer service or serving as an auxiliary pioneer?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">‘Our thankfulness becomes more intense when we look at what is taking place around us. There is increasing violence, hatred, and strife worldwide. Paul well described our times as “critical” and “hard to deal with.” (2 Tim. 3:1) In the midst of these distressing conditions, we have good news in abundance to share with others. We have two fine magazines, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> This month we can offer individual copies or subscriptions. We also have brochures on a number of subjects. These publications can bring genuine refreshment to those who read them. Thankfulness for what we have should move us to be liberal in sharing them with others. -Heb. 13:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> It may be that in the area where you live, people demonstrate little interest in spiritual things. In contrast with that, there are territories that are fruitful. Much interest is being found among foreign-language groups. If you are able to speak more than one language, is it possible that you can serve in an area in this country where there is a real need for your help? Your circuit overseer may have some suggestions along these lines.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’ There is every reason to be thankful for what we have, truly an abundance of good things. Our thanks to Jehovah can be best expressed by making known his name and purposes to others.—Isa. 12:4, 5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> God's Kingdom is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> real government, having power and authority. It was the theme of Jesus’ preaching. (Matt. 4:17) Teaching others and bearing witness to Kingdom truth was the main part of Jesus’ ministry. He taught us to pray for the Kingdom and to keep on seeking it first. (Matt. 6:9, 10, 33) Remaining close to Jehovah and his organization, fulfilling our preaching commission, and keeping separate from the world enable us to maintain our Kingdom unity. By our actions and words, we show that we are on the side of the Kingdom. —John 18:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> Since 1914, the Kingdom has become a reality for millions of subjects. The unity demonstrated by these subjects of the Kingdom stands in stark contrast to a divided world. We must make the Kingdom real In our lives if it is to be a unifying force. What makes it real to us?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Like other governments, the Kingdom has a set of laws. Yet, it differs in that its laws are found in the Bible. Regular reading of God’s Word gives us needed reminders of what is required of us as Kingdom subjects' Personal study of our publications and dlrectloh from “the faithful and discreet slave” help us apply God’s laws in our everyday lives. (Matt. 24:45) As we make such personal application, the Kingdom becomes increasingly real to us, drawing us closer together in the worldwide brotherhood, making us a united family of worshipers under Jesus’ rulership.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ Unity Through Kingdom Preaching: </span><span class="font10">Our commission is to preach the good news of the Kingdom “to the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) Preaching “with one accord&quot; unifies us as we strive to “glorify” Jehovah. (Rom. 15:5, 6) Zealously participating with our fellow workers earth wide strengthens our faith and permits Jehovah’s spirit to work through us to accomplish his will. “Having plenty to do in the work of the Lord” makes us “steadfast, unmovable.” —1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> In many lands Satan tries to disrupt our unity by interfering with our</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">preaching work. He uses every means at his disposal to sow discord and create misunderstandings, tb try to produce contention and strife. (Prov. 6:19; Gal. 5:19-21, 26) He would like us to get involved in the world’s controversies and even to take sides on political and social issues. (Jas. 3:14-16) The Scriptures exhort us to resist his Influence; otherwise, he will devour us as his prey. (1 Pet. 5:8, 9) The reality of the Kingdom hope must not be allowed to fade from our hearts and minds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">,i.?&gt;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘ Maintaining our unity requires soundness of mind and wisdom from above. When difficulties arise, especially if they Involve our brothers, we must manifest the fruitage of the spirit to keep peace. Worldly traits, such as pride, envy, and egotism, are divisive and must be overcome. (Eph. 4:1-3; Col. 3:5-10, 12-14) We need to keep our minds filled with positive, upbuilding thoughts. The Kingdom is a reality in our lives! But we have to be vigilant to keep it that way!—Eph. 6: 11,13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> The reality of our marvelous Kingdom hope unites us in a spirit of oneness that will never end.—Ps. 133:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> We certainly have a full schedule of theocratic activities to look forward to during April and May! On April 14 we will celebrate the Memorial of Christ’s death. As many people as possible should be encouraged to be present for that important occasion: business acquaintances, unbelieving relatives, schoolmates, newly interested persons, and Bible students. Make a list of those you plan to invite so that none are missed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The following week we will encourage all who attended the Memorial to hear the special public talk on April 23, on the subject “False Religion’s End Is Near.” It is hoped that many interested ones who hear this forthright message will see the need to associate with the congregation on a regular basis, not just on special occasions.</span></p></li>

Do you not agree that there will be “plenty to do in the work of the Lord” during this Memorial season?—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> A supply of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> will be consigned to each congregation. The cartons containing the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> should be stored in a safe place and should not be opened until the conclusion of the program on April 23. At that time the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> will become available for distribution to the brothers and to the public. At the conclusion of the congregation meetings, circuit assemblies, or special assembly day programs on April 23, those in attendance will each receive a copy so that they can become acquainted with its contents and be equipped for its distribution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Elders Will Havs Plenty to Do: </span><span class="font11">Early this month the body of elders should meet to discuss details of the special campaign. Congregations should endeavor to cover all their assigned territory. Before the campaign ends, make special effort to work those territories that have not been covered in the past six months. In view of the importance of the work, we will want to set aside as much time as possible for the ministry. No doubt more publishers than usual will enroll as auxiliary pioneers. Quite likely many Bible students will also be joining us as newly approved unbaptized publishers. What an enjoyable time we will have as we labor together in the Lord’s work!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Congregation Book Study conductors should make definite arrangements for group witnessing on Saturdays and on Sundays. Everyone should be encouraged to have an active share. In addition to activity on the weekend, evening witnessing should be scheduled at least once a week during the campaign. Some may wish to meet for service after school to accommodate students who would like to have an extra share.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Meetings for field service should be scheduled so that publishers and pioneers can get an early start in the ministry each day. These meetings should be brief. Each should feature a simple presentation of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font11"> Afternoon meetings for service may include a suggestion or two for making return visits on those who have accepted the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font11"> However, some publishers may prefer to engage in the distribution both morning and afternoon. To that end, the service overseer will want to ensure that enough territory is available. The name and address of everyone who shows interest should be noted on a house-to-house record. The main points of the brief discussion may be included in the remarks column. This will pave the way for a return visit later in the week or month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup> If one congregation helps another to cover its territory, names and addresses of interested persons should be turned in to the congregation holding the territory.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Parents, are your children working toward becoming unbaptized publishers? It has been observed that in some congregations, well-behaved children have accompanied their dedicated parents in the ministry for a number of years, and the children do very well, although they are not yet publishers of the good news. Parents ought to consider whether their children really do qualify for this privilege. Two of the elders can discuss all the factors with the family head and determine whether the child can be counted as an unbaptized publisher.—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">om</span><span class="font11"> pp. 99-100.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> Are any publishers in your congregation’s territory no longer active in offering a sacrifice of praise to Jehovah? (Heb. 13:15) Some who are inactive may have been overcome by discouragement or by the anxieties of life, although continuing to adhere to the Bible’s moral standards. A friendly visit by one of the elders may move them to return to regular association with the congregation and, at an appropriate time, to renewed activity in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> All Who Qualify Can Share In This Enjoyable Work: </span><span class="font11">Do some of you children or teenagers find it difficult to share in the house-to-house ministry? What about you new ones whose experience in the preaching work is quite limited? You will find working with this special </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> to be most enjoyable! A simple presentation is all that is needed.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>You might say something like this:</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">■ “This month we’re distributing an important message in 232 lands around the world. The message is important because it gives us solid reasons to believe that there is a solution to the problems we face today. We would like you to have your personal copy.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Or you might try this:</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">■ “This month about five million volunteers are distributing an important message in scores of languages. It has been prepared for people who would like to see an end to the problems all of us face today. This is your personal copy.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>This simple presentation may suit you:</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">■ “We’re encouraging everyone to read this important message entitled [read title of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News],</span><span class="font11"> Notice what it states here on page 2 concerning the increasing problems of . . . [read selected sentence from </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News].</span><span class="font11"> We’re sure you’ll enjoy reading the rest of this timely message. This is your copy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>13</sup> Take a personal interest in each one who accepts the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font11"> Speak slowly and clearly; there is no need to hurry your presentation. We want to be thorough in covering our territory and see that all who express an interest in reading the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> are given a personal copy. When no one is at home, carefully mark your house-to-house record so that you can return at an appropriate time to offer the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> to the householder. This </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> may be used in street witnessing when an individual shows an interest in reading the material. Copies should not be handed out indiscriminately as if they were handbills. Rather, approach passersby, and explain the importance of the message being featured. Use the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> in informal witnessing, such as while traveling or when witnessing to fellow employees during your lunch break. Those who are shut-ins or otherwise indisposed may offer them to visitors, doctors and nurses, salesmen, and others who come to their home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>13</sup> How many return visits will you make during the campaign? No doubt a great many, since all those who have shown interest in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> should be revisited. On the initial call, it is best to feature only the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font11"> Then, when you return, make a few comments about the timeliness of the message in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News. </span><span class="font11">Listen carefully as the householder expresses his opinion on what he has read. His comments will help you to know what to offer in the latest magazines and perhaps how to prepare for further discussions. If you get a favorable response on the return visit, try to start a Bible study.—1 Cor. 3:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> “Your Labor la Not In Vain”: </span><span class="font11">Will all this work be worthwhile? Paul assured the Corinthians: “Your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.&quot; (1 Cor. 15:58) Over the years, our efforts to distribute </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> have been greatly blessed. One couple who were moving into an empty apartment found an older copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> in a drawer. It was the only thing left in the whole apartment. After reading it, they contacted the local congregation and requested a Bible study. They began attending all the meetings and later expressed a desire to be baptized. Perhaps a copy you leave will bring similar results!—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">km </span><span class="font11">11/74 p. 1; see also </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font11"> November 8, 1976, page 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>16</sup> We have a tremendous task ahead of us. Our goal is for each congregation to cover its assignment of territory by May 14 or by the end of the month if it is necessary to extend the time for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font11"> distribution. Consignments have been made so that each regular and auxiliary pioneer will receive 250 copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News. </span><span class="font11">Each congregation publisher will get up to 50 copies. Publishers and pioneers should accept only as many copies as they will be able to distribute and should return any extras for others to use. Good cooperation in this regard will ensure the widest distribution possible of this important message. If because of having a large territory assignment some congregations have not covered their territory by mid-May and copies are still available, it may be practical to invite nearby congregations to help. In other congregations the need may be filled locally if publishers increase their activity by enrolling as auxiliary pioneers or by engaging in the ministry more often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>16</sup> Whole-souled devotion to Jehovah will be required if we are going to accomplish our work. (Col. 3:23) Lives are involved. People cannot afford to ignore the meaning of world conditions today. Time is running out. They must face the fact that man does not have the solution to this world’s problems. God does. Those who wish to obtain God’s blessing must act decisively, without delay, in harmony with his requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>11</sup> At the conclusion of the special campaign on May 14, will we let our hand rest? No! We will keep busy in harmony with Paul’s inspired counsel.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Do You See a Need?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is described as a Helper and a Refuge. We know we can go to him In time of need and he will help us. (Ps. 18:2; 46:1) We can imitate this empathetic quality by offering to assist others when we see a need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> What motivates a person to go out of his way to help someone else? Most people recognize this as the loving, humane thing to do. Certainly God’s Word encourages it. (Rom. 15:1) Paul urged us to keep 'an eye, not in personal Interest upon just our own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.’ —Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> This is something we can all find joy in doing. (Acts 20:35) Paul singled out young Timothy as an example of one who would “genuinely care for the things pertaining to” his brothers. (Phil. 2:20) It is good that we have many young people in the congregations today with a similar disposition. But whether we are young or old, there are things that we can do if we see a need.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">* Have you ever felt that some have needs that could be given better attention? Perhaps a brother or a sister was in the hospital, and few came to visit; or someone became Incapacitated, but there was no one to run errands or assist with household chores. Jesus views those serving Jehovah as members of a family who genuinely care for one another. (Mark 3:33-35) In the parable of the sheep and the goats, he showed that those who enjoy the right hand of the King’s favor do so because of their helpfulness to the King’s brothers.—Matt. 25:40.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> How Can I Help? </span><span class="font10">What can be done to provide help when there Is an obvious need? Could we take the initiative to assist In some way? Perhaps there are older ones who need encouragement, but they have no close associates to help them. There may be young people who need a helping hand. A newly Interested family with several children may show up at the Kingdom Hall when the publisher who studies with them is not present. They may appreciate having someone volunteer to help them with the children.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">* As we grow in love for the truth and for Jehovah’s organization, we also grow in appreciation and concern for others in the congregation. Paul encouraged us to widen out in this regard. (2 Cor. 6:11-13) Jesus emphasized that our showing love to one another is the primary way we demonstrate that we are truly his followers.—John 13:35.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> So when we see a need, genuine love for our brothers and for the congregation should motivate us to take the initiative and assist in whatever way we can. (Gal. 6:9, 10) This concern for others draws us together in close bonds of love and unity. (1 Cor. 10:24) In this way, we do our part to help fill a need in the congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—Magazines for Our Urgent Times!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">‘In fulfillment of Bible prophecy, world-shaking events are taking place! As we contemplate what is happening around us in the world and also within the theocratic organization, we can appreciate how urgent it is that we preach “the good news” of the Kingdom. (Mark 13:10) This gives us reason to carry on our ministry with zeal during the month of April.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> The Importance of our message is being emphasized by the special work we will undertake this month. With eager anticipation we await the release of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> that we will distribute during April and May. To build our enthusiasm for this work as well as cultivate interest in our territory, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> will carry timely articles that emphasize the prophetic significance of disturbing world events. How can we prepare a presentation that will stimulate interest in the magazines?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Likely you will be able to develop an effective presentation by following these basic steps: (1) Select an article in one of the magazines that you feel will appeal to people in your community. (2) Pick out a statement or a quoted scripture in this article that you believe will stimulate the interest of the householder. (3) Prepare a brief presentation that includes a friendly greeting, a question or statement that highlights an interesting Scriptural thought, and a sincere invitation to accept the magazines. As you can see, this is quite simple and uncomplicated. Perhaps you could get together with another publisher whom you work with in the ministry and prepare a presentation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'Since the April 22 “Awake!” raises the question, “Are These the Last Days?,” you could review the material under the heading “Last Days” on page 13 of the “Reasoning” book. You might begin by saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “We’re calling to discuss the meaning of the turbulent events taking place around us. Note what this article says..</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">^The April 1 “Watchtower” raises the question: “Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—A Taboo Subject?” When offering the magazine, you could say: </span><span class="font10">■ “It’s often said that religion is one subject that should not be discussed because it’s so controversial. What do you think about that?” Then refer to a statement in the article.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> You may be using the April 15 “Watchtower” with the article “Is Religious Truth Attainable?” You might get a good response with this introduction:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “Because there are so many religions today, some people wonder if religious truth is attainable. This article reveals a way that you and I can find a satisfying answer to this question...</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’ Before going out in the work, why not practice your presentation with another publisher to get the feel of it? Likely you will be able to share helpful suggestions with each other that will increase your effectiveness and give you greater confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’As the end of this system draws nearer, may we quicken our pace to help honesthearted ones to escape from Babylon the Great. (Rev. 18:4) </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> play a vital role in this never-to-be-repeated work. We are thankful that Jehovah has provided these fine instruments for our use!</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Search for the Teachable Ones</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> “No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him.” (John 6:44) Jehovah, who searches the heart, will reward those who are teachable and act on what they learn. (Jer. 17:10; John 6:45) We have the privilege of being his fellow workers in searching for meek ones who yearn for a new world.—Ps. 37:11; 1 Cor. 3:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’Jesus described his disciples as “fishers of men.” (Matt. 4:19) While that type of work can sometimes be strenuous, there is much satisfaction in getting good results. Instead of working for our personal gain, we are actually rescuing the “fish&quot; from certain destruction. A successful fisherman has to know what to do to attract the fish. Likewise, we must present the Kingdom message in an appealing manner that will arouse the interest of our hearers. This is especially true when we make return visits. What can we say?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If interest was shown in the “Watchtower” articles dealing with religion, you might say: </span><span class="font10">■ “Previously we spoke about why many people do not like to discuss religion. Don’t you feel that’s rather strange, since most of our neighbors claim to be Christian? Perhaps you wonder why religion is such a divisive and controversial subject.” Allow for response. Turn to page 322 in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book, and share a few thoughts under the heading “Why Are There So Many Religions?&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> You might use this similar approach, to start a discussion on the subject of religion:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “Is there some way we can be sure that we have the true religion? [Allow for response.] Because there are so many different religions, many people feel confused and uncertain.” Turn to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book, pages 328-9, where it discusses the question “How can a person know which religion is right?” Comment briefly on question number 5, “Do its members truly love one another?” Explain how more can be learned through a personal Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>b</sup>If the householder seemed concerned about world conditions, you might want to try this: </span><span class="font10">■ “Apparently you feel concerned about the bad conditions we have to cope with in living and in raising our families. The Bible reveals a wonderful promise that God will fulfill in the near future.” Read Proverbs 2:21, 22, and explain how Jehovah has promised a world of lasting peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• When making return visits after the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> campaign has begun, please be sure to leave a copy of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> with householders who do not have one. What you might say on return visits when following up placements of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> will be discussed in the May issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Since the Word of God “exerts power,” we should try to use it in our presentations. (Heb. 4:12) Make it a point to encourage the householder to read the Bible for himself. (Compare Acts 17:11.) If we diligently do our part, Jehovah will bless our efforts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah Imparts Power</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> As Jehovah’s people, we have been given the assignment to preach the good news while maintaining our conduct “fine among the nations.&quot; (1 Pet. 2:12; Matt. 24:14) In view of the critical times as well as our own weaknesses and shortcomings, we could never accomplish this work on our own. (2 Tim. 3:1-5) How happy we are that we can look to Jehovah for help!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The apostle Paul endured many trials. (2 Cor. 11:23-27) How was he able to cope with these and finish his assigned work? Jehovah granted him “power beyond what is normal.” (2 Cor. 4:7) Paul acknowledged such divine help when he wrote: “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.” (Phil. 4:13) Jehovah will help us in the same way. How can we obtain this assistance?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> By Praying Incaasantly: </span><span class="font9">Jesus urged us to ‘keep on asking, seeking, and knocking,’ and not to give up. (Luke 11:5-10) Our persistence in prayer demonstrates to Jehovah the depth of our concern, the intensity of our desire, and the genuineness of our motive. (Ps. 55:17; 88:1,13; Rom. 1: 9-11) Paul recognized the importance of persistence in prayer when he urged us to “pray incessantly.” (1 Thess. 5:17) Prayer is one of the primary ways in which we obtain Jehovah’s help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> By Following Theocratic Direction: </span><span class="font9">“Theocracy” means “rule by God,&quot; who is love. We benefit horn his rule by accepting his authority and following his instructions in large and small decisions. “The faithful and discreet slave&quot; represents theocratic rule on this earth. (Matt. 24:45-47) Cooperation with the organization that the “slave&quot; uses is vital if we are to obtain Jehovah’s blessing. (Compare Hebrews 13:17.) Jehovah will reward our loyalty to him and our willingness to obey his laws by supplying the power we need at the appropriate time.—Heb. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> By Keeping Close to Our Brothers: </span><span class="font9">Love is the identifying mark of Jesus’ disciples. (John 13:34, 35) With a wide variety of personalities, friction can arise among us because of personal differences. We need to be tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another. (Eph. 4:32) This makes it possible to remain close to our brothers In the faith and to be encouraged by their steadfast endurance under trial. “Knowing that the same things in the way of sufferings are being accomplished in the entire association of [our] brothers,” we have the God-given strength to deal with similar pressures.—1 Pet. 5:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> By Maintaining a Good Routine of Personal Study: </span><span class="font9">Fortifying our minds and hearts spiritually enables us to fight off Satan’s attack. (1 Pet. 5:8) A good routine of personal study will increase our bank of godly knowledge. We can draw from this when facing everyday challenges. Paul stressed that “accurate knowledge” plays a vital part in gaining salvation. (1 Tim. 2: 3, 4) It is essential to take in spiritual food regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>7</sup> All the provisions necessary to help us keep strong are readily available through the Christian congregation. Wholehearted support of its activities will guarantee that we “will walk and not tire out.”—Isa. 40:29-31.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ as a Model for Youths</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">'After a lengthy Bible discussion, a youth stated: “I was struck by the dynamic personality of Jesus Christ. Here is a leader I could believe in.” The same cannot be said of any national figure or of sports’and entertainment heroes. True Christians do not view as models those who openly embrace worldly standards and unchristian life-styles.—Ps. 146:3, 4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Young people can be assured that when they come to exercise faith in Jesus Christ, they present themselves as God’s sheep and are known by Jesus. The Fine Shepherd cares for them. (John 10:14,15, 27) Youths who foUow Christ as their Model are blessed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> One brother who currently serves at Brooklyn Bethel had this privilege of service as a goal from the time he was eight years old. He was encouraged to view Bethel service as a practical way to follow Christ’s example when he got older. His parents, as well as traveling overseers, kept this before him. To help him prepare, they encouraged him to apply himself diligently just like a member of the Bethel family, performing chores at home, helping to maintain the Kingdom Hall, and developing skills in the ministry. After enjoying Bethel service for years now, he is thankful that as he was growing up, he made the effort to Imitate Christ’s example.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Jesus did not pursue a worldly career; he chose the ministry. A young sister wanted to pioneer when she graduated from school but held back because of not having suitable parttime employment. She kept thinking: 'First I’ll find a job, then I’ll put In my pioneer application.' An elder pointed out that the longer she waited, the better a full-time job would look, since she would not have anything holding her back from accepting it. She related: “I prayed to Jehovah for his spirit to guide me.” She immediately enrolled as an auxiliary pioneer and later became a regular pioneer. Shortly after that, she found ideal employment that accommodated her pioneer schedule.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Jesus boldly declared the Kingdom message to everyone. (Matt. 4:23) Young Christians can also learn to be bold in preaching, not being intimidated by others. One 14-year-old Witness reported: “Everyone at school knows my position as a Christian. . . . They know it so well that if I meet a classmate while I’m engaging in the ministry, I do not feel embarrassed. Fellow students usually listen, and many times they accept literature.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> Considering Christ’s example can help young people make wise decisions about their future. Instead of being preoccupied with worldly pursuits, they 'remember their Grand Creator’ by showing zeal in Jehovah’s service. (Eccl. 12:1) Like Christ Jesus, they are cultivating “the love of the Father,&quot; which brings blessings far more desirable than anything offered by the world. Instead of “passing away” with the old world, they can look forward to 'remaining forever.’ —1 John 2:15-17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">note: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Joyful Praisers&quot; District Convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-by-day review of the district convention program should be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on outstanding points. This well-prepared review will help the congregation remember key points for personal application and for use in the field. Comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Question</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> BOX</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">■ How can we comment most effectively at meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We look forward to assembling together at weekly congregation meetings. There we have an opportunity to express our faith and encourage others by our commenting. (Prov. 20: 15; Heb. 10:23, 24) We should view commenting as a privilege and strive to have a regular share. How can we do this most effectively?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Preparation is the first step. Reading and pondering over the material in advance is important. Try to capture the spirit of what is being presented. Although the subject may have been discussed in the past, look for any enlarged or enhanced points that are presented. Keep in mind the overall theme of the material. When preparing comments from a publication that features an in-depth study of a Bible book, such as the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font9"> book, try to see how a particular verse relates to the verses surrounding it. Following these suggestions will stimulate your thinking ability. It will help you to prepare good comments and find joy in your participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The best comments are concise, simply stated, and based on the publication being studied. The first commenter should answer the question directly, leaving other points for additional comments. Avoid long, rambling comments that take up excessive time and prevent others from sharing. Express yourself in your own words, rather than read your comment word for word from the publication. Auxiliary comments could Include points covered in cited Scripture texts. Listen carefully to what others say so that you can avoid any unnecessary repetition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is good to raise your hand several times but not on every paragraph. We Invite youngsters to share in commenting. If you are hesitant about speaking up, you may let the conductor know in advance which paragraph you would like to comment on, and likely he will be able to give you an opportunity to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All of us should make an earnest effort to have something to share at congregation meetings that Involve audience participation. Remember, the success of such meetings depends to a great extent upon our willingness and effectiveness in commenting.—Ps. 26:12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Good Use of Your Time</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">■Jehovah is time conscious. He wants us to be aware of time too. Through his organization he helps us to be time conscious. We are urged always to have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15: 58) In this way, we can be more effective In Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Each of us has the same amount of time each week—168 hours. How well do we use our time? Do we show that we really know what time it is from Jehovah’s standpoint? Are we being distracted by nonessential activities?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> It is Important that we be well organized. Many try to maintain a priority list. Each item is put on the list according to its importance. How can that be determined? The Bible says that a man should “see good for all his hard work.” (Eccl. 3:13) Some tasks yield better results than others. Consider the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">results</span><span class="font9"> that each one will bring. Will finishing the job produce significant benefits? Will you “see good&quot; for your hard work? If not, it may not be a high-priority task.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> In Our Ministry: </span><span class="font9">We appreciate it when others arrive at meetings for service on time, listen carefully to instructions, and leave promptly for the territory. We would rather be busy preaching than waiting. Paul obviously felt strongly about the need for good order when he wrote: “Let all things take place decently and by arrangement.”—! Cor. 14:40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> When we are out In field service, we can lose valuable time on coffee breaks. However, when weather conditions are severe, a break will refresh us and help us to keep going. Many, though, prefer to keep busy witnessing to people and forgo socializing with the brothers on coffee breaks during the time that has been set aside for the ministry. Balance is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> “Even the stork . . . well knows Its appointed times” to migrate, and the ant “prepares Its food even in the summer” in order to be ready for the winter, says the Bible. (Jer. 8:7; Prov. 6:6-8) Therein lies the secret of making good use of time. We too must ‘know our appointed times.’ Without being overly rigid, we should be time conscious. We need to know not only what we have to do but also when it needs to be done. We should get into the habit of thinking ahead, making allowances for possible delays. And we should also be willing to cut short some activities to make time for something more important, such as preparation for our meetings, field ministry, and other theocratic activities.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> We want to be like our heavenly Father, Jehovah God, who teaches us that “for everything there is an appointed time.” (Eccl. 3:1) By making good use of our time, we can ‘fully accomplish our ministry.’ —2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Millions of people believe that God created life. Many others believe in evolution. Then there are those who are not sure what to believe. The book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font9"> is for all such people. This publication presents a thoroughly researched explanation of how life got here and what this means for our future. During June, we will be featuring this fine book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Even prominent ones in the scientific community have acknowledged the book's logic. One scientific researcher In the Netherlands wrote: “This book really does exceed all expectations. The logical buildup of the chapters and the Illustrations are scientifically so up-to-date that you would have to be blind to raise any objections to them.” An attorney declared: “I have read It four times and continue to be impressed with the depth of study, scholarship, and documentation that went into its production.&quot; So we can be confident that yet others will appreciate this book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> You </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">might choose to make a brief presentation like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ Open to page 6, and say: “Many people think that our beautiful earth and life upon it resulted from an accident. What do you consider to be a reasonable explanation as to how all of this came about? [Allow for response.) Mountains of evidence confirm the Bible’s account of a Creator who not only is very powerful but also loves us very much. He is the true God, and his name is Jehovah.&quot; Read Psalm 83: 18, and briefly explain how it is his purpose to transform the entire earth into a paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If you want to come to the point quickly, you might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Have you ever wondered about this question?&quot; Point to the title of the book, turn to page 7, read the questions in paragraph 2, and explain that the book provides satisfying answers from the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Or you might try this:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Did you ever wonder how the earth came into existence? Many insist that it is the result of some colossal cosmic explosion. What do you think? [Allow for response.) The Bible teaches that God created the earth as our everlasting home. It is different from the other planets in our solar system. As far as we know, it is the only one in the universe that has all the complex provisions needed to sustain life.” Turn to paragraph 5 on page 130, and explain why the earth must be the work of a Master Designer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup>Another approach might be something similar to this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Some people think that we evolved from ape-men. They claim that our ancestors looked like this. [Show the picture on page 89.) What do you think about that?” Allow for response. Point out what is stated in paragraph 20, and then read Acts 4:24, which identifies Jehovah as our Creator and LifeGiver. “This book examines the entire theory of evolution in relation to what is stated in the Bible.” Refer to table of contents on page 5, and point out some titles, such as those for chapters 1, 7,15, and 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> This book can be a blessing to sincere people who have been deceived by those without faith in Jehovah or his Word. The factual information the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font9"> book contains can help such ones to grow in appreciation for our Creator, who lovingly cares for us.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Those Without Faith</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> In this day and age, it has become popular to be viewed as educated and progressive in thinking. Human philosophies and fanciful theories are extolled, while spiritual values are Ignored. Sincere people who are Interested in simple facts and understandable truths will welcome the opportunity to examine the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life —How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font9"> This book can help those who lack faith. (Rom. 1:19, 20) Be sure to make return visits on all those who express interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> You might begin your discussion this way:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “I’m sure you are aware that many educators support the belief that the human family got here by evolution. It teaches that everything exists by accident. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.] This idea is still referred to as a theory. A theory is ‘a speculation’ or ‘an unproved assumption.’ For centuries men believed that the earth was flat; now we know that was a foolish assumption not based on fact. Could the same be true of the theory of evolution?” Read the introductory comments on page 4, and then discuss Isaiah 42:5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Or </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">you might take this approach when you return:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “It is common to meet people who do not believe in God. Years ago, that was very rare. Why do you think so many have lost faith in God? [Allow for response.) Many attribute their loss of faith to the appalling increase in violence and distress in our world. They reason that If there is an almighty God, why doesn’t he put an end to all this suffering? Those who can’t find a satisfying answer to that question often become atheists. But there is overwhelming evidence to prove that God exists and that he will soon make the earth a place of happiness and peace.&quot; Continue the discussion by using the Scriptural thoughts found in paragraph 19 on page 196.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> With your Bible in hand, you</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">might open the conversation by saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “We are calling again to point out why a study of the Bible is practical for our times. Most people have a Bible, but few take time to read it. Some frankly tell us that they don’t have much confidence in the Bible anymore. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.) One of the things that convinces us that the Bible is the Inspired Word of God is the fulfillment of its prophecies.” Refer to Scripture texts in paragraph 6 on page 234.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> This thought might get a favorable response:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “We can see beauty and marvelous evidence of wisdom In the things that surround us on this earth. This lovely picture of a sunset is a fitting example.” Show the illustration on pages 12 and 13. Mention points from “Some Things to Think About,” and explain how this book provides satisfying answers to vital questions about our world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">• We can be a blessing to others by using this book to help them find a solid basis for faith in their Creator.</span></p>

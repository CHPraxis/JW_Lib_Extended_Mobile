<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Praise Jehovah Daily</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Our God, Jehovah, is a marvelous, loving Creator, the Source of all life and happiness. In view of his greatness, he truly Is deserving of praise from all his creation. Individually, we wish to say as did the psalmist: “I will add to all your praise. My own mouth will recount your righteousness, all day long your salvation.” (Ps. 71:14,15) To do this, we must seek ways to praise Jehovah day by day and be motivated to speak well of him, his righteousness, and his provisions for salvation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The early Christians set a fine example In praising Jehovah. In reference to the 3,000 baptized at Pentecost, we read at Acts 2:46,47: “Day after day they were in constant attendance at the temple with one accord,... praising God and finding favor with all the people.... [And] Jehovah continued to join to them daily those being saved.” They were learning wonderful truths about Jehovah and his Messiah. Their joy was contagious, encouraging still others to listen and learn and to praise Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Opportunities Arc Available Every Day: </span><span class="font9">Today many find that they can praise Jehovah daily by informal witnessing. Advance planning helps them to be more productive. A sister who had resolved to share in Informal witnessing found that someone had smashed two windows and broken into her car. She called a repair service and then prepared to witness to the serviceman. Her preparation Included praying for Jehovah’s direction. As it turned out, she witnessed to the serviceman for an hour and placed the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font9"> book with him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">‘Another sister regularly met a neighbor while they were walking their dogs. During one encounter, they had a serious conversation about life’s problems, and that led to more discussions. In time, a Bible study was started. Interestingly, the neighbor later confessed that she would not have listened to Jehovah's Witnesses if they had called at her door, since she did not believe in God or the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Some find it possible to give a witness when salesmen or others call at their door. A sister in Ireland received a call from a man selling life insurance. She explained that she is looking forward to enjoying everlasting life. This was an entirely new thought to this man, who had been raised as a Roman Catholic. He accepted the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font9">book, attended a meeting the following week, and agreed to have a Bible study. Now this salesman is a baptized brother.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’ All of us should be alert to opportunities to praise Jehovah daily. It is helpful to keep a few magazines or tracts where they can be seen and can be readily offered to visitors. In some areas a little time spent on a park bench might give you several chances to witness to others who stop to relax for a few minutes. Some Witness youths in school keep Bible literature on their desk as a way to initiate a conversation with someone who notices it and asks questions. Have in mind one or two Scripture references that you can use. Ask Jehovah to help you. You will be blessed for doing so.—1 John 5:14.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare for and Enjoy Congregation Meetings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> As an association of brothers, we wisely congregate regularly for our weekly meetings. (1 Tim. 4:15, 16) How can we enjoy and derive the most benefit from them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Time should be set aside on a regular basis to prepare for the meetings. Some may be able to spend more time in preparation than others. However, no matter how busy we are, it is wise to find some time to prepare for meetings. Preparing together as a family Is especially beneficial—Eph. 5:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> For th* Thcocratle Ministry School: </span><span class="font9">Strive to keep up with the weekly Bible reading schedule. (Josh. 1:8) Review the material that will be covered, and bring the necessary publications so that you can follow along with the speakers. Think about ways you can use this information in your ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ For the Service Meeting: </span><span class="font9">Look over the program outlined in Our </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font9"> Read the articles that will be discussed. If material from a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> article or some other publication will be considered, look that up and read it too. If field service presentations will be demonstrated, review these in advance so that you will be ready to use them in your ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> For the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtowar</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Study: </span><span class="font9">Read over the lesson in advance, noting the answers to the questions. Looking up the cited scriptures will help you to get a better understanding. Meditating on how the lesson fits in with what you already know will broaden your knowledge. Plan to participate during the study by preparing brief comments on at least one or two paragraphs. This is an important way to make “public declaration of our hope.”—Heb. 10:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> For the Congregation Book Study: </span><span class="font9">First, survey the material; consider the chapter title and subheadings. Then, as you read, take note of the key ideas. Review the supporting Bible verses. Try to answer the questions in your own words. When you have prepared the lesson, review it in your mind. Try to recall the main points and lines of reasoning. —2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Enjoy the Mooting*: </span><span class="font9">To eqjoy the meetings to the full, it is important to be on time in order to share in the opening prayer, asking for Jehovah’s spirit. You also benefit from the refreshing Kingdom songs. If you do not have young ones or some other reason for sitting In the back of the hall, likely you will find that if you sit toward the front, there will be fewer distractions and you will get more out of the program. Parents with little ones who may have to be taken out during the meeting can minimize the distraction by sitting close to the aisle and toward the rear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Endeavor to look up the scriptures that are read. This will help you remember what you hear. Talking to your family and friends about what you leam will impress the Information on your mind. Applying these suggestions will make the meetings more meaningful and enjoyable, and they will truly “incite [us] to love and fine works.”—Heb. 10:24,25.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Your Advancement Manifest</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Think back to the time when you first heard the Kingdom message. Simple truths stirred your desire for knowledge and understanding. Soon you were able to see a need to make adjustments in your way of life because Jehovah's ways are so much higher than your ways. (Isa. 55:8,9) You made advancement, dedicated your life, and got baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Even after making some spiritual progress, there were still weaknesses that had to be overcome. (Rom. 12:2) Perhaps you had fear of man, which made you reluctant to share in field service. Or perhaps you were falling short in displaying the fruitage of God’s spirit. Rather than hold back, you were determined to make advancement by setting theocratic goals for yourself.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Several years may now have passed since you made your dedication. In looking back, what advancement can you see in yourself? Have you achieved some of your goals? Do you have the same zeal you “had at the beginning&quot;? (Heb. 3:14) Timothy was already a mature Christian with years of experience when Paul urged him: “Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons.”—1 Tim. 4:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Personal Examination Needed: </span><span class="font9">When we ponder over our past course, do we fihd that we continue to have some of the weaknesses we had when we started? Have we failed to reach some of the goals we set? If so, why? Even though we had good intentions, we may have procrastinated. Perhaps we have allowed the anxieties of life or the pressures of this system to hold us back.—Luke 17:28-30.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">‘While we can do little about the past, we can certainly do something about the future. We can make an honest appraisal of ourselves, determine where we are lacking, and then put forth a concentrated effort to improve. We may need to do better in displaying the fruits of God’s spirit, such as selfcontrol, mildness, or long-suffering. (Gal. 5:22,23) If we have difficulty getting along with others or cooperating with the elders, it is important that we cultivate humility and lowliness of mind.—Phil. 2:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘Can we make our advancement manifest by reaching out for privileges of service? With extra effort brothers may be able to qualify as ministerial servants or elders. Some of us may be able to enroll as regular pioneers. For many more, auxiliary pioneering may be a reachable goal. Others may strive to improve personal study habits, become more active participants in congregation meetings, or be more productive as congregation publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup>1t is, of course, up to each one of us to decide where we need to make advancement. We can be sure that our sincere effort to “press on to maturity” will add greatly to our joy and make us more productive members of the congregation.—Heb. 6:1.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Letting Our Light Shine Continuously</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> What is light? The dictionary defines it as “something that makes vision possible.” But really, despite his advanced technology, man still does not fully know the answer to the question Jehovah raised as recorded at Job 38:24. Can we get along without light? Without light we could not exist. Light is essential for physical sight, and the Bible tells us that in a spiritual sense, “God is light.” (1 John 1:5) We are totally dependent upon the One who “gives us light.”—Ps. 118:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> This is true in a physical sense but even more so in a spiritual way. False religion has misguided the masses of people, leaving them in spiritual darkness, “groping for the wall just like blind men.” (Isa. 59:9,10) Prompted by his unsurpassing love and compassion, Jehovah ‘sends out his light and truth.’ (Ps. 43:3) Literally millions of appreciative ones have responded, coming “out of darkness into his wonderful light.” —1 Pet. 2:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Jesus Christ plays a vital role in bringing this light to the world. He said: “I have come as a light into the world, in order that everyone putting faith in me may not remain in the darkness.” (John 12:46) All his time, energy, and resources were directed toward making the light of truth known. He traveled the length and breadth of his homeland, preaching and teaching in virtually every city and village. He endured relentless persecution from every side, but he remained steadfast in his commission to spread the light of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Jesus concentrated on selecting, training, and organizing disciples, with a specific goal in mind. At Matthew 5:14-16 we read his instructions to them: “You are the light of the world.... Let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.” Just like Jesus, they were to be “illuminators in the world,” disseminating the light of truth far and wide. (Phil. 2:15) They gladly accepted that responsibility, viewing it as their primary purpose in life. A short time later, Paul was able to say that the good news “was preached in all creation that is under heaven.” (Col. 1:23) The entire Christian congregation was united in accomplishing that great work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> We today should be thankful that we have come to be among those who have “put off the works belonging to darkness.” (Rom. 13:12,13) We can show our appreciation by imitating the example set by Jesus and the faithful Christians in the past. The need for others to hear the truth is more urgent and critical now than at any time in human history. No other activity can begin to compare with this work in its urgency and far-reaching benefits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> How Can Wo Shino as Illuminators? </span><span class="font10">The primary way to let our light shine is to share in the Kingdompreaching work. Every congregation has regular, organized arrangements for preaching in its assigned territory. Huge quantities of literature are made available in great variety and in many languages. Extensive education is provided through the meetings, and assistance in training others personally is offered by those who are experienced. Opportunities to participate are open to men, women, older ones, and even children. Every individual in the congregation is invited to participate at whatever level his abilities and circumstances permit. All the func</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">tions o</span><span class="font10">tthe cop-gregation are focused on preaching, with provisions to help every member share in some way. Regular, close association with the congregation is the best way to ensure that our light keeps shining.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup> We can shine in ways that may not involve a verbal witness. We can attract the attention of others simply by our conduct. That is what Peter had in mind when he urged: “Maintain your conduct fine among the nations, that... they may as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses glorify God.” (1 Pet. 2:12) Many judge a work or an organization by the conduct of those associated with it. When observers note people who are morally clean, honest, peaceable, and law-abiding, they view such people as different and conclude that they live by standards that are on a much higher level than those followed by the majority. So a husband is letting his light shine when he honors and cherishes his wife in a loving manner; the wife does the same by respecting her husband’s headship. Children stand out as different when they obey their parents and avoid sexual immorality and the use of drugs. An employee who is conscientious about his work, honest, and considerate of others is highly valued. By demonstrating these Christian qualities, we are letting our light shine, recommending our way of life to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> Preaching is talking to others about what we have learned from God’s Word. That is done from the public platform or at the doors, but it is by no means limited to such occasions. Our daily activities put us in contact with scores of people. How many times a day do you speak to your next-door neighbors? How often does someone knoc</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">k at your </span><span class="font10">door? How many different people do you rub shoulders with when you do your shopping, ride the bus, or work at your secular job? If you are a young person in school, can you count the number of individuals you speak to each day? The opportunities to speak to others are virtually unlimited. All you need to do is to get a few Scriptural thoughts in mind, keep a Bible and some tracts</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, DECEMBER 1995</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">handy, and take the initiative to speak up when you get the chance.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Even though informal witnessing is quite simple, some feel reluctant to try it. They may be reticent, insisting that they are too shy or too nervous to approach strangers. They may feel apprehensive about drawing attention to themselves or getting a harsh response. Those who are experienced in informal witnessing can tell you that there is rarely any cause for anxiety. Others are basically just like us; they have the same needs, feel the same concerns, and want the same things for themselves and their families. Most will respond in a kindly manner to a cheerful smile or a friendly greeting. To get started, you may have to ‘muster up boldness.’ (1 Thess. 2:2) Once you get going, however, you may be surprised and delighted with the results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> W» Ara Biassed When We Let Our Light Shine: </span><span class="font10">Here are some examples of refreshing experiences resulting from informal witnessing: A 55-year-old lady was attempting to cross the street. Just as a car was about to hit her, a sister grabbed her arm and pulled her to safety, saying: “Please take care. We are living in perilous times!” She then explained why the times are so dangerous. The lady asked, “Are you one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?&quot; Having obtained one of our books from her sister, the lady wanted to meet one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and this encounter made it possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> A sister started a conversation with a woman in a waiting room at the doctor’s office. The woman listened attentively and then said: “For some time, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been crossing my path; but if sometime in the future I actually become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses myself, it will be because of what you just told me. Listening to you is like starting to see light in a dark place.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>12</sup> An act of kindness can be a stepping-stone to helping others learn the truth. While walking home from field service, two sisters noticed an elderly woman who appeared to be ill as she got off the bus. They stopped and asked the lady if she needed help. She was so surprised that two complete strangers would show interest in her that she insisted on knowing what it was that sparked such a kind gesture. This opened the door for a witness. The lady readily gave her address and warmly invited them to visit her. A study was started. Soon the lady began attending meetings and Is now sharing the truth with others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>13</sup> An elderly sister takes advantage of early-morning witnessing on the local_beach. She meets housemaids, baby-sitters, bank clerks, and others who take their morning stroll on the boardwalk. She conducts Bible studies, sitting on the benches. Several people have learned the truth from her and are now Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>14</sup> At her secular job, a sister heard a fellow worker talk about a political party that she believed could solve the world’s problems. The sister spoke up, relating promises about what God's Kingdom will do. This discussion at work led to a regular Bible study in the home, and eventually the lady and her husband became Witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> Never Forget You Ara a Witness! </span><span class="font10">When Jesus described his disciples as “the light of the world,” he reasoned that they should be helping others to benefit from the spiritual enlightenment of God’s Word. If we apply Jesus’ counsel, how will we view our ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>16</sup> When searching for employment, some people choose a part-time job. They put limits on how much time and effort they will put into it because they prefer to use most of their time pursuing activities they find more rewarding. Are we taking a similar view of our ministry? Even though we might feel obligated and even be willing to set aside some time for the ministry, should our primary interests be elsewhere?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>17</sup> Realizing that there is no such thing as a parttime Christian, we made our dedication, ‘disowning ourselves’ and agreeing to follow Jesus </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“continually.’’ </span><span class="font10">(Matt. 16:24) Our desire is to continue being “whole-souled,” taking advantage of every opportunity to let our light shirie in order to reach people wherever they are. (Col. 3:23, 24) We must resist worldly attitudes, maintain our zeal as in the beginning, and make sure that our light continues to shine forth brilliantly. Some may have allowed their zeal to cool off and their light to become only a faint glow, hardly visible a short distance away. Such a one may need help to recover lost zeal for the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>18</sup> Some may tend to hold back because our message is unpopular to many. Paul said that the message about the Christ was “foolishness to those who are perishing.” (1 Cor. 1:18) No matter what others said, however, he forcefully declared: “I am not ashamed of the good news.” (Rom. 1:16) One who is ashamed feels inferior or unworthy. How could we possibly feel ashamed when we speak about the Supreme Sovereign of the universe and the marvelous provisions he has made for our eternal happiness? It is unthinkable that we would feel inferior or unworthy when we speak these truths to others.

<p><span class="font9">■ Should all baptized publishers fill out the health-care power of attorney (proxy) forms that the Society sent to all congregations last year?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Time and unforeseen occurrence&quot; can suddenly thrust us into situations that test our integrity to Jehovah. (Eccl. 9:11) Preparing for such challenges ahead of time will minimize Satan's opportunity to get us to compromise. (Prov. 22:3; 1 Pet. 5:8) Unforeseen medical emergencies that challenge our resolve to “keep abstaining ... from blood&quot; are an example of such Satan-inspired attacks on our integrity—Acts 15:28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To help us in such medical situations, all congregations In the United States received a supply of healthcare power of attorney (proxy) forms from the Society’s Legal Department in December 1994. Using pertinent state and federal law, these forms anticipate the type of medical emergency described above and re-ish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as &quot;Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-request items.</span></p>

Distributor copies may be requested fer to legal authority for judges and hospital lawyers who may question or challenge our refusal of blood. In addition, these forms set forth detailed medical information about minor blood fractions, alternative nonblood management, and end-of-life decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Should all baptized publishers fill out a health-care power of attorney (proxy) form? As the December 1994 Our </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> announcement said, “publishers are not obliged to prepare these forms.” Thus, It* is a personal decision each one of us must make.

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> We were delighted when the new book, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge Thai Leads to Everlasting Life,</span><span class="font9"> was released! It is designed to help people to come quickly to an accurate knowledge of the truth. In December we will have the first opportunity to offer this book in our territory. What can we say to stimulate interest?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Here is a presentation that might appeal to the person whose faith in God has become weak:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Many people grew up believing in God, but now they have found that their faith is not what it used to be. What do you think may be the reason for that? [Allow for response.) Our faith in God is strengthened by considering the marvels of the universe. [Read Psalm 19:1.] The One whose laws govern these heavenly bodies has also provided valuable direction for us. [Read Psalm 19:7-9.] These verses stress how important it is to learn all we can about God and his purposes. [Call attention to the illustration on pages 4 and 5, and read the caption.] If you would like to benefit from this special knowledge, I would be pleased to leave this book with you.&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Having some recent distressing news event in mind, you might say: </span><span class="font9">■ “Likely you heard about [mention the event]. Have you ever wondered if God is really concerned about the injustice and suffering that we see about us or even experience ourselves? [Allow for response.] The Bible assures us that God loves us and that he will help us through times of distress.&quot; Read portions of Psalm 72:12-17. Open the book to page 70, and point out that this book, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge Thai Leads to Everlasting Life,</span><span class="font9"> answers a question that millions have asked, Why does God permit suffering? “You will find the Bible’s answer to that question very comforting. I would like to leave this book withyou so that you can read about it yourself.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If you meet a parent, you might focus on the family:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Most parents agree that there are many problems in trying to maintain a happy family life. What do you observe to be serious obstacles? [Allow for response.] Most of us do the best we can, but we usually appreciate assistance that will help us achieve better results. The Bible gives excellent advice. [Read portions of Colossians 3:12,18-21.] The Bible has a lot more to say on this subject, as outlined in chapter 15 of this book, entitled 'Building a Family That Honors God.’ It reviews counsel given in the Bible showing how to relieve marital stress and how to cope with the problems facing our children. I am sure you would enjoy reading it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>s</sup>If you prefer something brief, you might try this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Have you ever wondered why we grow old and die? Chapter 6 in this book explains the cause of death and how God will remove it. The Bible tells us that God has promised everlasting life for those who love him. [Read John 17:3.) If you would like to read about this, you will find the book most enlightening.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> If we are well prepared, we may be able to use this book to ‘open up the Scriptures’ to others in a way that will bring them great joy!—Luke 24:32.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Return to Those Who Showed Interest</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">'When releasing the new book, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life,</span><span class="font9"> the convention speaker explained that “honesthearted students should be able to learn enough through a study of it to take a stand for Jehovah and get baptized.” The book is designed to teach the truth quickly. It concisely provides specific information that can motivate students to make spiritual progress. It presents the truth in a positive way without dwelling on false doctrines. To have success in using this new instrument, we must make return visits on those who showed interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> If you spoke to a person who lacked faith in God yet demonstrated some interest, you might begin by opening the book to the illustration on pages</span><span class="font9"> 4 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">and 5 and saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “When I was here previously, we looked at this lovely illustration of beautiful surroundings. The caption asks, ‘What must you do to eqjoy them?’ How would you answer that? [Allow for response.] The Bible clearly identifies one of the basic requirements. [Read John 17:3.] Knowledge is essential to our faith in God. An excellent way we can learn what we need to know is by systematically studying the Bible.” Turn to chapter 1 and point out some of the encouraging thoughts in paragraphs 1 to 5. Explain how a Bible study is conducted, and offer to return for more discussion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you return to continue your discussion on why God permits suffering, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “The last time I was here, we talked about [whatever the event was]. The question came up as to why God permits so much suffering in the world. What conclusion<sup>1</sup> did you come to? [Allow for response.] It is encouraging to know that God is not responsible for such distressful conditions.” Turn to pages 71-2 in the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Ufe,</span><span class="font9"> and discuss some of the Scriptural thoughts covered in paragraphs 3 to 5. Offer to return again to explain why we can be sure that God’s permission of suffering will soon come to an end.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> If you are returning to visit a parent who is concerned about family problems, you might say this: </span><span class="font9">■ “I know that you, as a parent, want the best for your children. Since it is impossible to shield them from everything that is bad, you have to teach them how to cope with life’s problems. How do you think that can be done? [Allow for response.) One of the most Important things a parent can provide is training.” Turn to pages 145-6 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font9">book, and call attention to the Bible’s practical counsel, emphasizing its importance and how following it can be a blessing. Offer to return again to demonstrate how to use this book to learn more about acquiring a happy family life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> If you are making a call where you used a brief presentation, you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “It was never God’s purpose that we grow old and die. He intended that we live forever in a paradise earth.” Display the illustration on pages 188-9. Read paragraph 11 on page 184. Make arrangements for another return visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> Surely this new book is another provision from Jehovah to ’speed up’ the ingathering work in these last days. (Isa. 60:22) If we use it effectively, we can impart knowledge that may help someone toward gaining everlasting life.</span></p>

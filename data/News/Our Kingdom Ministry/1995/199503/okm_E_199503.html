</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> On Sunday, April 23, a special public talk will be delivered on the arresting subject “False Religion’s End Is Near.” At the conclusion of the meeting that day, a thought-provoking four-page </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font9"> will be released. The timely message it contains will be given worldwide distribution during the three-week period from April 24 to May 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> In all parts of the world, people are perplexed. No matter where they live, they are plagued by problems. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font9"> will be of real interest to those who are sincerely concerned about what Is happening, since it will direct them to God’s Word as the infallible source of guidance for man. (Ps. 119:105) All of us look forward to getting a copy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font9">when it is released on April 23. In the meantime, there is much to do in preparation for this intensive three-week campaign.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Encourage All to Have a Zealous Share: Who may have a share in the work? Certainly everyone who is already a publisher will be eager to do so! What about Bible students who are regularly attending congregation meetings? Some have associated with us for quite a while and are making steady progress. If they have brought their lives into harmony with Scriptural principles, are they qualified to be counted as Kingdom pro-claimers? The publisher conducting the Bible study may discuss the matter with the student, and if the student is desirous of sharing in the field service, two elders will review with him the material on pages 98 and 99 of the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry.</span><span class="font9"> This should be done as soon as possible so that those who qualify as unbaptized publishers may have a full share in the Campaign. Bible students who are not yet qualified to be counted as unbaptized publishers may still be encouraged to share this timely </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font9"> with acquaintances or family members.—See </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> November 15, 1988, page 17, paragraph 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> This work is not difficult; everyone can have a share. Parents may Include practice sessions with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font9"> as part dfthe weekly family Bible study so that all family members will be well prepared to present it from house to house. A simple presentation is usually best. After a brief introduction, offer the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font9"> to the householder, and encourage him to read it. When householders manifest interest, make a record so that you can return to cultivate the interest. (1 Cor. 3:6, 7) The key to success is to have a simple, well-prepared presentation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> There will be “plenty to do” during April and May. In next month’s issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> further information will be provided in “the insert entitled “Plenty to Do in the Work of the Lord.”-1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Much Is Given—Much Is Demanded</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> How favored we are to have the truth! Because of our dedication to Jehovah, we have been “entrusted with the good news.” (1 Thess. 2:4) This places us under greater responsibility. Jesus said: “Everyone to whom much was given, much will be demanded of him.”—Luke 12:48b.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> How true those words are! Since all of us have been blessed with a knowledge of God’s Word, a wonderful association of brothers, and a marvelous hope, it can truthfully be said that much has been given to us. Reasonably, much is expected in return.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Maintain a Proper View of Requirements: Some have concluded that too much is expected of us. As Head of the Christian congregation, Jesus Christ determines “what is needed&quot; to make it function properly. (Eph. 4:15, 16) He assures us that ‘his yoke is kindly and his load is light.’ (Matt. 11:28-30) He lovingly makes allowances for those who have limitations. (Luke 21:1-4) If we give our best, regardless of the amount, we will be blessed.—Col. 3:23, 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Ask yourself, 'Are Kingdom interests first in my life? Am I using my time and my assets in a way that results in. praise to God’s name and benefit to others? Do I find that my greatest pleasure comes from serving Jehovah rather than from selfishly enjoying material things?’ Our honest answers to these questions reveal the motives within our hearts.—Luke 6:45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Avoid Being Tempted to Do What Is Bad: Never before have there been such temptations and pressures toward self-interest, greed, and love of sensual pleasure. Every day we are faced with moral challenges, with temptations to compromise. To meet these challenges successfully, we must ask Jehovah to help us. (Matt. 26:41) Through his spirit, he can make us strong. (Isa. 40:29) Reading God's Word daily is a great help. (Ps. 1:2, 3) Self-discipline and self-control also play a major role.—1 Cor. 9:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> It is not enough to love what is good—we must also hate what is bad. (Ps. 97:10) This means not cultivating a yearning for those things that are bad. Proverbs 6:16-19 lists seven things that Jehovah hates. Obviously, one who wants to please Jehovah must also hate such things. Having been blessed with an accurate knowledge of the truth, we should want to act in accord with that knowledge, keeping our minds fixed on good things.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’It is proper to pray for circumstances that are favorable for “always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15:58) Many have found that a busy schedule in Jehovah’s service is a protection because it allows little time for pursuing worthless things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> All things considered, what Jehovah requires of us is very reasonable. (Mic. 6:8) We have every cause to be grateful for each privilege of service. (Eph. 5:20) Therefore, we keep “working hard and exerting ourselves,” confident that oiir reward will be infinitely greater than anything required of us.—1 Tim. 4:10.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Question Box</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">■ What attention needs to be given to the equipment we use in the witness work?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Although having an appropriate Scriptural presentation in mind, a publisher of the good news might be unprepared when it comes to the equipment he uses. When at the door, he may not have the current literature offer. The magazines, brochures, and tracts in his witnessing case may be wrinkled or tattered. He may be unable to And a pencil or a house-to-house record because his case is not properly organized. It is important to give careful attention to your equipment before sharing in field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> What items should a well-equipped witnessing case contain? A Bible is essential. Include a supply of house-to-house records. Be sure that you have the publication that is being featured for the month. Current issues of the magazines, as well as tracts and brochures, are also needed. Carry a copy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book. Having the latest </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> will allow you to review suggested presentations before going to the door. When working in territory where you are likely to meet people who speak a foreign language, it would be good to have the booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Good News for All Nations.</span><span class="font9"> Having a copy of one of our publications designed for young people will help you to be prepared to speak to teenagers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Everything used should be neatly arranged in your case. The case itself does not have to be new, but it should be clean and in good condition. Your witnessing case is part of your equipment for use in declaring the good news. Keep it in good order.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Bethel Service—More Volunteers Needed</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> We are thrilled to see the great work that Jehovah Is doing in these last days. Psalm 110:3 indicates that during this time an outstanding quality of God’s people would be their willingness to have an active share in Kingdom service. Around the earth Jehovah’s people are expending themselves to get the good news of the Kingdom preached. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers</span><span class="font10"> book, page 295, states: “Some serve as members of the global Bethel family. This is a staff of full-time ministers who have volunteered to do whatever they may be assigned in preparing and publishing Bible literature, in caring for necessary office work, and in providing support services for such operations. This is not work in which they gain personal prominence or material possessions. Their desire is to honor Jehovah, and they are satisfied with the provisions made for them in the way of food, lodging, and a modest reimbursement for personal expenses.&quot; If you have visited Bethel, you are to some extent already acquainted with the work being done there. However, we wish to provide additional information to enhance your appreciation for this unique privilege of service and also to make you aware of the Society’s needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> To put into perspective the significance of Bethel service and its rich heritage, let us review a bit of history—some ancient and some modern—of Jehovah’s organization. For some 19 years, the Watch Tower Society had its headquarters in a four-story brick building at 56-60 Arch Street, Allegheny, Pennsylvania. It was called the Bible House. However, by 1908, the Bible House family, or the Society’s headquarters staff, had grown to over 30 members. It was time to expand. After seeking divine guidance, the brothers decided that Brooklyn would be the most suitable center for the work. So a building at 13-17 Hicks Street in Brooklyn was purchased to house the Society’s offices and an auditorium. These offices were opened on January 31, 1909, but there were no housing accommodations as part of this Hicks Street building. At first, it was thought that housing facilities could be rented. However, none of the residences in the Brooklyn Heights area were for rent. As things turned out, to their surprise and joy, the brothers were able to purchase “at a bargain price&quot; a four-story brownstone at 124 Columbia Heights, the former residence of Henry Ward Beecher. Also, 126 Columbia Heights became available. The March 1, 1909, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font10"> joyfully announced: “The new home we shall call Bethel,&quot; supplanting the Pittsburgh term “Bible House.” So in April 1909, Bethel opened its doors, and the family moved into its new home. Brooklyn Bethel has been in this same location for 85 years.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Was Bethel an appropriate name for the Society’s headquarters? Consider the Biblical origin of the name and its connections. Going back over 3,700 years, Genesis chapter 28 relates the experience of 77-year-old, unmarried Jacob. Jacob appreciated sacred things but was hated by his twin brother, Esau. At the direction of Isaac, his father, Jacob fled from Beer-sheba and headed north to the land of Abraham’s relatives, among whom Jacob intended to find a wife. After traveling some 62 miles, Jacob stopped to rest for the night at a place called Luz in the Judean hills. At Genesis 28:10-19, we read the fascinating details of how Jehovah gave Jacob full assurance of divine support. In a dream, Jacob saw a ladder extending from earth to heaven. Angels were busily ascending and descending the ladder, and Jehovah was stationed above it. Then Jehovah spoke, confirming that the promise to Abraham regarding a seed was being passed on to Jacob and that Jehovah would not leave him. What a fear-inspiring experience for spiritually-minded Jacob! Is it any wonder that this became a very special place in his eyes? To him this place was the “house of God,” or, in the Hebrew language, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Behth-'El', Behth</span><span class="font10"> meaning “house” and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">'El</span><span class="font10"> meaning “God.” —Gen. 28:19, ftn.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">♦Thus, the name Bethel has a rich historical background and is appropriate for the world headquarters of Jehovah’s people. Today God’s servants do not have divinely inspired dreams. Angels are not seen ascending and descending on a ladder from Bethel to heaven. Brothers are not receiving visions or hearing God’s voice directly. Yet, when you consider all that has happened at Bethel these past 85 years, from the time of Brother Russell till now, there is no doubt that Jehovah’s hand has been with his anointed servants, part of the spiritual seed of Abraham, at Bethel. So many outstanding events in the history of Jehovah’s modern-day Witnesses are closely associated with Bethel! Consider some highlights:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ On October 2, 1914, as he entered the Bethel dining room, Brother Russell accurately announced: “The Gentile Times have ended; their kings have had their day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ In the early 1920’s, during morning worship, a member of the Society’s editorial staff used the expression “God’s organization.” This so stimulated their thinking that by 1925 the brothers had come to see that there are two distinct and opposing organizations, Jehovah’s and Satan’s.—w85 3/15 p. 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ In the early morning hours one day in 1931, shortly before the convention in Columbus, Ohio, the president of the Society, Brother Rutherford, discerned that the name Jehovah’s Witnesses truly described God’s people and the work they were already doing and that they should be identified as His witnesses.—yt&gt;75 p. 151.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ Early in 1935, questions were raised about who are the “great crowd,” or “great multitude.” (Rev. 7:9; </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">KJ)</span><span class="font10"> Some among those who expressed themselves at that time suggested that they were an earthly class. On May 31, 1935, at the Washington, D.C., convention, a satisfying explanation was given.—</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">jv</span><span class="font10"> p. 166.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘These few examples illustrate how Jehovah, through his holy spirit, has given guidance and support to his faithful anointed servants at Bethel. And what about the angels? When you consider all the bitter opposition from our enemies and the difficult years when resources were scarce, there Is no doubt that without angelic protection and assistance, Bethel could not have operated so remarkably all these years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’Besides the headquarters staff in the United States, there are Bethel families In the 100 branches scattered throughout the world. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry,</span><span class="font10"> page 116, states: “The name Bethel... is certainly appropriate for these centers of theocratic activity.&quot; What kind of work are Bethel volunteers assigned to do?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> A Variety of Worki </span><span class="font10">The assignments of work given to members of the Bethel family are varied. At Brooklyn and in a number of other branches, some brothers work in the factory operating presses that print Bibles, books, magazines, brochures, and tracts for worldwide distribution. Others share in binding the Bibles and books, while the work of yet others involves shipping these publications to congregations around the world. A number are assigned to maintain the equipment and the buildings. In the Bethel Home, a lot of work is involved in caring for the family. For example, at Brooklyn Bethel, within 20 minutes breakfast is served to approximately 3,700 people in 12 dining rooms. In the laundry, brothers and sisters process 35,000 pounds of clothing each week, Including 13,000 shirts. In addition, housekeepers maintain a high standard of cleanliness in the 21 residence buildings in Brooklyn and care for a host of other vital duties.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Qualifications and Requirements: </span><span class="font10">In view of the physical stamina and strength required for much of this work, presently there is a need for healthy single young men. To apply for Bethel service, a young man must be dedicated and baptized for at least a year. He must be a devoted, spiritual person. Also, he must be willing to perform hard work. In the world today, many people view hard work as something to be avoided. So the young man applying for Bethel service needs to put on the new personality to such an extent that he wants to do hard work, doing with his hands what is good work. (Compare Ephesians 4:28.) That means that he should not be one who has his mind on the pursuit of personal pleasures, recreation, or entertainment. When considering Bethel service, he should already have put aside such youthful traits. Paul’s words at 1 Corinthians 13:11 well apply: “When I was a babe, I used to speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe; but now that I have become a man, I have done away with the traits of a babe.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Are you between the ages of 19 and 35? Do you enjoy good health, physically and emotionally? Can you read, write, and speak English well? Are you a spiritual person who has a deep love for Jehovah and his organization? If called to Bethel, would you remain faithfully in that service for at least one year, working at any job given you? If you can answer yes to these questions, you do well to consider the unique privilege of Bethel service. The blessings are abundant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Blessings of Bethel Service: </span><span class="font10">The article “Looking With Appreciation Upon the ‘House of God,’&quot; in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> of June 15, 1994, noted: “When attending an assembly, do you sense a deep contentment, surrounded as you are by happy worshipers of Jehovah? Just imagine, a Bethel worker has the privilege of serving Jehovah amid a group of brothers every day! (Psalm 26:12) What excellent prospects for spiritual growth that offers! A brother remarked that he learned more to help him shape his personality within one year at Bethel than he did in three years elsewhere. Why? Because nowhere else did he have the opportunity to observe and imitate the faith of so many mature Christian personalities.” (Prov. 13:20) Indeed, this is one of the unique blessings of Bethel service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>11</sup> At Brooklyn Bethel, volunteers enjoy close association with members of the Governing Body and other anointed ones, as well as with longtime faithful brothers of the other sheep class. No matter what assignment of work one has, it is a blessing to work in unity with such faithful, loyal companions. Here are some comments from members of the Brooklyn Bethel family that reflect the feelings of those who have a part in this precious privilege of service:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ A brother with 62 years of Bethel service, who has worked in a variety of assignments over the years, commented on the spirit that exists at Bethel: “We’re all one family; we’re all brothers. We work together. All of us have our assignments. It’s wonderful to see the brothers work hard; you can see the effort they put forth. We have brothers who sweep the floor. When you’re keeping the place clean, you’re keeping the family healthy. When you keep the family healthy, the family is productive. It’s essential. It’s important to have people in the office. All together we produce the result—the Kingdom witness worldwide. This is the best place in the world to make a career of serving Jehovah. If you want to be in the full-time service, you can do that best right here. Everything is available to you. We enjoy extra things here. It makes you see the organization because you hear from all comers of the earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ One 75-year-old anointed brother, whose first work assignment was in the bookbindery some 48 years ago, observed: “It’s a beautiful experience to live among dedicated, baptized servants of Jehovah. When I see a young man coming to Bethel, my heart wells up with thanks to Jehovah because I know this man is going to have a happy life here at Bethel.” Regarding things he treasures about Bethel, he added: “I love its people. I think they are beautiful. There is something about the brothers that have been at Bethel many years that you don’t find any place else on the face of the earth. There Is the warmth, understanding, and unity that is beyond understanding.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ Another brother who has been in Bethel service for over 62 years commented on further benefits received: “Coming to Bethel enables you to get a specialized education in the field of publishing . .. and above all, a Bible education to equip you to be a proper representative of Jehovah God wherever you’re sent in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ A member of the Governing Body, who is now 92 years old, has been serving at Bethel for 58 years. What does he think of Bethel service? “The Bethel family here and worldwide is a marvelous arrangement of devoted people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ Some months before a member of the Governing Body died faithful in his assignment at 98 years of age, he expressed himself this way: “I love to serve at Bethel. It is the best place under the sun.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ What is a young man’s view of Bethel service? One young brother recently wrote: “Since, as Jesus said, ‘giving reaps the greater happiness,’ Bethel is the happiest place I have ever been.” He has captured the spirit of Bethel—giving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ A brother who has 51 years of full-time service nicely summed things up by saying: “Bethel service is really unique. It is a vital part in the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose here upon the earth. So anyone who has the privilege of serving at Bethel should esteem that very highly. Really, Bethel enables us to give full expression to a life of godly devotion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup>The Daily Routine: </span><span class="font10">The dally routine of a member of the Bethel family totally absorbs him in a life of Kingdom activity. At 7:00 a.m. Monday through Saturday, morning worship begins in our dining rooms. There are comments on the day’s text by members of the family and then a summary by a member of the Governing Body or by another brother with many years of full-time service, followed by the morning prayer. This program strengthens the family spiritually for the day’s activity. Members of the Bethel family will tell you that it is a highlight of the day. After a hearty breakfast, Bethel family members eagerly go to their various assignments of work. The workday Monday through Friday extends from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with one hour set aside for the noonday meal. Work is also scheduled from 8:00 a.m. to 11:55 a.m. on Saturday. In the evenings, on Saturday afternoons, and on Sundays, Bethelites go to their congregation meetings, share in the house-to-house or Bible study activity, or care for personal responsibilities. They may use the Bethel library facilities for personal study or to prepare for meetings. Oh, yes, there is time for needed rest and relaxation. (Mark 6:31,34) From this brief description, it can easily be seen that Bethel service allows a person to devote a great amount of his time each day to sacred service, free from distractions of this old system of things.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> Congregation Activities: </span><span class="font10">Members of the Brooklyn Bethel family are assigned to more than 350 congregations in the New York City area. They value the role of the local congregation in maintaining their spirituality. Thus, they are active with their congregation, attending the five meetings and regularly sharing in the field ministry with their brothers. In addition to congregation meetings, the Bethel family has its own </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> Study on Monday evening; elders and ministerial servants are assigned to make comments for the benefit of all. Since the Bethel schedule emphasizes spiritual things, it results in a joyful, happy life of service to Jehovah.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> Preparation for Bethel Service: </span><span class="font10">Young men frequently ask what they can dp in order to prepare for Bethel service.<sup>-</sup>A member of the Governing Body serving on the Personnel Committee said: /When you come to Bethel, come to serve, not to be served. The more you learn to serve, the greater will be your happiness. Learn to give and not to take. Be modest, be humble. The fruitage of the spirit —that’s where real Christianity lies.”25fes, developing your spirituality &lt;and a close relationship with Jehovah are keys to success at Bethel. That is why pioneer</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">s are often chose</span><span class="font10">n when new volunteers are selected for Bethel. When a person has disciplined himself over a period of time to spend 90 hours a</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">month preaching and teaching and giving to others, as well as schedu</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ling necessa</span><span class="font10">ry work to sustain himsglf, he has built a good spiritual foundation for Bethel service and its orderly way of life. Please note, however, that Bethel service is not limited_to tho</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">se who are pioneer</span><span class="font10">ing. Anyone meeting the basic requirements can </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">apply</span><span class="font10">.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>16</sup> Additionally, it is good for young men to learn how to work with their hands. Manual labor is not looked upon with favor in this old system of things. Love of self motivates many people to desire work that requires little effort or that gives an outward appearance of prestige. Yet, knowing how to use various tools and devices is very practical and useful. (Prov. 22:29) Often, young men can learn manual skills from their parents or by helping experienced older men work on various projects around the Kingdom Hall or by assisting elderly ones with necessary maintenance of their homes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>16</sup> Sometimes young ones ask: “Should I get extra secular training to qualify for Bethel service?” Secular training, in itself, does not qualify a person for <sup>v</sup>Bethel service. Spiritual qualitiesareall-important and required of\all who are invited. We encourage parents and their children who are still of school age to consider carefully the balanced view of secular education that is presented in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font10">qf Noyember L 1992. pages 15 to 21. A decision on secular education is a personal matter. Whatever a person decides, he should make sure that he is able to maintai</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">n his spiritual progress</span><span class="font10"> by continuing to focusFbn the principal work of Jehovah’s people, bearing witness to the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>17</sup> No matter what kind of secular training one receives, it is highly valuable to learn how to think. The Bible commends thinking ability and practical wisdom. (Prov. 1:4; 3:21) Learning </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">how to think</span><span class="font10"> and retain information enables you to acquire knowledge and skills that will be useful to you and to Jehovah’s worldwide organization. Finally, no matter what skills one may have, it is very important to be able to get along well wit</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">h other</span><span class="font10">s. Bethel volunteers must work closeiy' together as a team to acpom-plish the work. Thus, an independent or competitive spirit must be replaced by a cooperative and loving disposition and a willingness to submit to theocratic direction.—Compare Ephesians 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>18</sup> Yo.ung pe</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ople</span><span class="font10"> in Jehovah’s organization have a wonderf</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ul opportuni</span><span class="font10">ty t</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">o work at developing</span><span class="font10"> the abilities mentioned above. Then, if invited to serve at Bethel, they will be in a good position to be trained by Jehovah’s organization for further responsibilities. We urge you Christian parents and elders to continue keeping this matter before young ones. Many parents bring their children to tour Bethel regularly, thus acquainting them with what is done here. This has led many to come to Bethel after finishi</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ng their educatio</span><span class="font10">n.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> E x perienced One* </span><span class="font10">i Occasionally there is an opening for a brother or a sister who is somewhat over the age of 35 and who has the training and skills that Bethel needs. Much of the work that the Society is presently engaged in requires experienced ones to serve along with strong, capable young men who can be trained, “the expert along with the learner.”—1 Chron. 25:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>20</sup> An increasing amount of today’s work calls for those who have a background in electronics or experience with computer programming. The Society has literally scores of photocopy machines, laser printers, and personal computers, all of which require maintenance. There is also a need in the legal and medical fields: attorneys, doctors, physical therapists, registered and licensed practical nurses. Those skilled in various construction trades, such as engineering, plumbing, electrical, and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning), can be used. Mature brothers with in-depth accounting background, particularly those who might be certified, could be helpful. In order to reduce costs, the Society has its own fleet of vehicles used for supporting shipping operations. Therefore, experienced drivers and mechanics are needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>21</sup> Our greatest need is for dedicated single brothers and for those with special skills, some of whom may be married. You may obtain Bethel applications from your circuit overseer or at a district convention at the special meeting held for those interested in Bethel service, or you may write to the Personnel Committee, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483. If you are married, keep in mind that your mate must also be spiritually, emotionally, and physically qualified for Bethel service. If you have training and experience in one of the fields previously mentioned, please write out a detailed r6sum6 and attach it to your Bethel application.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>22</sup> Can You Answer an Urgent Call? </span><span class="font10">An urgent need exists for Bethel volunteers. If you meet the requirements for Bethel service, we strongly urge you to submit a Bethel application in answer to this urgent call. Do not be discouraged if you are not invited right away. You can renew your application yearly. This provides us with current Information about your availability.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>23</sup> In the hearing of the prophet Isaiah, Jehovah asked: “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Without hesitation Isaiah responded: “Here I am! Send me.” Thus, Isaiah embarked on a remarkable career as God’s prophet. Can you say, “Here I am! Send me”? Many blessings await you if you are called to serve in the “House of God,” Bethel.—Isa. 6:8.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Reminder for Secretary and Service Overseer</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">Each year an announcement in the February issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> directs the secretary and the service overseer to “review the activity of all regular pioneers.” What is the purpose of this review? It is to determine who may need help to meet the hour requirement before the service year ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Regular pioneers are required to devote 1,000 hours each year to the ministry. By the end of February, some pioneers find that they have fallen behind, and this can lead to discouragement. The elders can often be helpful to pioneers, giving them encouragement and practical suggestions. This can make the difference between pioneers successfully meeting their requirements for the year or dropping off the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The pioneers will certainly appreciate the genuine concern of the elders in this regard. The congregation will also benefit by having pioneers who are happy in their ministry, faithfully sticking to their assignment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Most Important Event in Human History</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> Jesus came to the earth at the direction of his Father to bear witness to the truth that would lead us to everlasting life. (John 18: 37) His faithfulness until death brought honor to Jehovah, sanctified God’s name, and provided a ransom. (John 17:4, 6) This is what made Jesus’ death the most important event in all human history.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’Since the creation of Adam, there have been only two perfect men who have lived upon this earth. Adam was in a position to bring marvelous blessings to his unborn offspring. Instead, he selfishly rebelled, condemning them to a miserable existence that would end in death. When Jesus came, he displayed perfect loyalty and obedience, opening up the opportunity for everlasting life to all who exercise faith.—John 3:16; Rom. 5:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> No other event can compare with Jesus’ sacrificial death. It changed the course of human history. It provided the basis for resurrecting billions of people from the dead. It laid the foundation for an everlasting Kingdom that would bring an end to wickedness and make the earth a paradise. It will ultimately free all mankind from every form of oppression and enslavement.—Ps. 37:11; Acts 24: 15; Rom. 8:21, 22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’ All of this helps us to appreciate why Jesus instructed his disciples to commemorate his death with the Memorial observance each year. (Luke 22:19) Appreciating its significance, we look forward to assembling with congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide after sundown on Friday. April 14. Before that time, It would be good to read together as a family the Bible accounts of Jesus’ last days on earth and his courageous stand for the truth. (Recommended passages are noted on our </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1995 Calendar,</span><span class="font9"> April 9-14.) He set a pattern for us in devotion to our Creator. (1 Pet. 2:21) Let us do our utmost to invite our friends and family, as well as Bible students and other interested persons, to this important gathering. Explain beforehand what will take place and the significance of the emblems.—1 Cor. 11:23-26.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> The elders should plan well in advance to be sure that the Kingdom Hall is neat and clean. Arrangements should be made for someone to obtain the emblems. The serving of the emblems should be well organized. Helpful suggestions on how we can show respect for the Lord’s Evening Meal were given in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> of February 15, 1985, page 19. It would be quite fitting for the congregation to arrange for expanded field service activities during several days before the observance as well as a few days following it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">‘Last year, a total of 12,288,917 were in attendance worldwide for the commemoration of this important event. Since it is the most important day on our calendar, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font9"> of us should be present.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Proclaiming ‘the Words of the Prophecy’</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> We are living In a time when prophecies in the book of Revelation are being fulfilled. Many are seeking to understand the meaning of the disturbing events taking place. They can benefit from ‘hearing the words’ of the prophecy of Revelation. (Rev. 1:3) During the month of March, we have opportunity to assist them by featuring the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font9"> book. When offering it we should keep In mind that the problems facing mankind today were foretold in the book of Revelation. What, then, can we say?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> This approach might be effective:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “War, famine, and disease have plagued mankind in this 20th century. Why do you think that is so when man has made so much technical advancement? [Allow for response.] Many are surprised to learn that these conditions were foretold in the Bible. Likely you are familiar with the expression ‘the four horsemen of the Apocalypse.’ What the Bible says about these horsemen is actually a prophecy that is being fulfilled in world events today. [Open the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font9"> book to chapter 16, and point out the illustrations on pages 91-7.] While this prophecy predicts a time of great distress, it also offers hope. [Read Revelation 6:2 in paragraph 3.] The Rider on the white horse is Jesus Christ. He has promised to conquer wickedness and bring about a world of happiness and peace through the Kingdom that he taught us to pray for.” Offer the book.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Perhaps this question might prompt a meaningful discussion:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “What do you feel is needed to remove the bad conditions in the world? [Allow for response.] Most people agree that there is a need for drastic changes if this world is going to survive. The Bible shows that God knows how to solve our problems and has promised to help us.” Turn to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font9"> book, page 171, and read Revelation 11:15 in paragraph 1. Turn to the illustrations on pages 302 and 308, and point out the blessings that will be realized under Kingdom rule by Christ. Then explain how the householder can personally benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* You might feel comfortable saying something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Many people who have read the Bible book of Revelation found it difficult to understand. It describes a variety of unusual and significant events. This book, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!,</span><span class="font9"> provides a verse-by-verse consideration of the entire book of Revelation and shows how we are personally affected by the fulfillment of Its prophecies.” Open the book to page 15, paragraph 2, and point out Revelation 1:1, in bold type. Explain that specific comments of this kind are provided on every single verse in the book of Revelation and that this information will help him to understand these remarkable prophecies. Offer to leave the book if there is a favorable response.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> If the person is busy or you are not certain there is sufficient interest, you might leave a magazine or a tract. When you return and interest is shown, the book could be offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’The message contained in Revelation affects all mankind. Everyone needs to hear the words of the prophecy. May we do all we can to proclaim this vital message.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Others “Observe the Things Written”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> It Is not enough to “hear” the words of the prophecies in the book of Revelation. To benefit fully, one must “observe” what is written. (Rev. 1:3) Placing literature is just an initial step toward making disciples. Once we have found interested ones who are willing to hear, we should go back promptly to assist them in learning more. What can we talk about on our return visit?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> If you spoke about the symbolic four horsemen on your initial visit, you might begin your conversation this way:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “Previously we talked about the book of Revelation and how its prophecies are being fulfilled today in world events. Revelation chapter 6 foretold the ride of the symbolic four horsemen, which would result in much violence and distress in the earth. We have seen this take place right before our eyes. Many wonder when this distress will end so that we can enjoy life in a peaceful world. What is your opinion? [Allow for response.) Jesus' disciples were interested in the answer to this question.” Read Matthew 24:3, where the question is raised, and then verse 34, where Jesus gave the answer. If the response is positive, explain more about the last days.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you discussed God’s Kingdom on the first call, you may decide to continue by asking this question:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">■ “In your opinion, what kind of government is needed to satisfy all mankind’s needs? [Allow for response. Read Jeremiah 10:23.] As you can see, God never intended that man should direct his own affairs. Attempts to do that without God’s help are the cause of most of our problems. God’s Kingdom Is the only government that can provide what we need.” Turn to page 230 in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font9"> book, and discuss the scriptures under the first subheading. Continue the discussion by explaining why we can put our full trust in God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> You might like to try this to initiate a Scriptural discussion: </span><span class="font9">■ Show the illustration on page 302 of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font9"> book, and explain: “Mankind will enjoy these conditions when God’s will is done on the earth as it is in heaven. However, some fear that bad conditions will come back again. That will be impossible because all the wicked ones will be gone.” Read Psalm 37:10,11. Invite the householder to take advantage of our Bible study program to learn more.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* If you left the tract “Life in a Peaceful New World,” point to the illustration on the front and then read paragraph 1 under the heading “Life in God’s New World. ” Then say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ “If we want to live in a world like that, there is something important that we must do.&quot; Read the last paragraph, and offer the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font9"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’ Since our objective is to start Bible studies, we need to make effective return visits. Schedule time for them, and prepare well. In this way we can truly help the honesthearted. —Rev. 22:6,7.</span></p>

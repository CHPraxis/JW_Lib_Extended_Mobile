<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>“Keep on the Watch”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">’When Jesus spoke the words recorded at Matthew 26:38-41, he was approaching the most critical time of his human existence. It would prove to be the most Important time in all human history. The salvation of all mankind was at stake. Jesus’ disciples needed to “keep on the watch.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Today we stand at the threshold of Jesus’ arrival In the dual role of deliverer and executioner. As watchful Christians realizing the urgency of the times, we do not Just fold our arms and wait for deliverance. We know that we must be ready at all times. It is necessary for us to keep “working hard and exerting ourselves” in our service to Jehovah. (1 Tim. 4:10) What about each one of us individually? Are we keeping on the watch?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Examining Oursalvas: </span><span class="font8">Jesus also warned: “Pay attention to yourselves.&quot; (Luke 21:34, 35) We must be attentive to ourselves, making sure that we are “blameless and innocent ... in among a crooked and twisted generation.” (Phil. 2:15) Are we living each day as Christians, Imitating Jesus and walking in harmony with the principles outlined in God’s Word? We must avoid unchristian conduct characteristic of a world that is “lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1 John 5:19; Rom. 13:11-14) When we examine ourselves in the light of the Scriptures, are we truly on the watch as Jesus instructed?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Elders must be alert to be diligent in carrying out their assignments in the congregation, realizing that they will render an account for how they care for the flock. (Heb. 13:17) Family heads have a special obligation to direct their households in the ways of Jehovah. (Gen. 18:19; Josh. 24:15; compare 1 Timothy 3:4, 5.) Also, how vital it is that all of us fulfill the Scriptural command to love one another! It is the mark of true Christianity.—John 13:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Be Alert to Warn Others: </span><span class="font8">Keeping on the watch involves more than paying attention to ourselves. We have a commission to make disciples of others. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Love of neighbor should move us to warn others so that they may survive the destruction facing this world. This is a responsibility resting upon all Christians. It is an essential part of our worship. (Rom. 10: 9, 10; 1 Cor. 9:16) Often we encounter apathy or outright opposition to this lifesaving work. We have an obligation to persist, even if the majority ignore our warning. (Ezek. 33:8, 9) Genuine love for God and neighbor will move us to persevere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> This is no time for complacency. We should neither allow the everyday anxieties of life to distract us nor become so involved in the pleasures of this system that they prove to be a snare. (Luke 21:34,35) If there ever was a need for a sense of urgency, it is now. The time is rapidly approaching for Jesus Christ to execute Judgment against this wicked system. Only those who are awake, alert, and watchful will survive. If we obey Jesus’ instructions and “succeed in escaping all these things,&quot; how thankful we will be!—Luke 21:36.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Are Jehovah’s Reminders Rousing Us Spiritually?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The psalmist lauded Jehovah, saying: “Your reminders are a concern to me.” (Ps. 119:99) The Hebrew word for “reminders&quot; conveys the thought that Jehovah calls back to our minds what is stated in his laws, his orders, his regulations, his commandments, and his statutes. If we respond, they will rouse us spiritually and make us happy—Ps. 119:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> As Jehovah’s people, we regularly receive admonition and counsel. Much of it we have heard before. Although we appreciate this encouragement, we are inclined to forget. (Jas. 1:25) Jehovah patiently provides loving reminders. The apostle Peter recorded some of these reminders in order to ‘arouse our clear thinking faculties that we should remember the commandments of the Lord.’—2 Pet. 3:1,2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’Again and again we are reminded about the importance of personal study and meeting attendance. This is done because these activities are so vital to our spiritual well-being.—1 Tim. 4:15; Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ The greatest challenge for some is fulfilling the Christian commission to preach. It takes effort, determination, and perseverance. Even though it requires much of us, we are helped to “stand firm” by having our “feet shod with the equipment of the good news.&quot; —Eph. 6:14,15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Our service has to be motivated by more than just mental awareness of Jehovah’s requirements. The apostle Paul reminds us that the heart provides the motivation we need to make “public declaration for salvation.&quot; (Rom. 10:10) If we have strong faith and if our heart is inclined toward Jehovah’s reminders, we will be compelled to speak out in giving praise to his name.—Ps. 119:36; Matt. 12:34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> When we work hard in performing good works, we rightly expect that this will bring us joy. (Eccl. 2:10) Paul identifies Joy as a fruit of Jehovah's spirit, and we should seek to abound in displaying it. (Gal. 5:22) Peter added that an “earnest effort” will be rewarded with a fruitful ministry, which produces joy—2 Pet. 1:5-8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> When we are faced with a challenge, we should remember the apostles’ firm stand as they declared: “We cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.&quot; (Acts 4:20) We are strengthened to carry on when we remember that ’by doing these things, we will save both ourselves and those who listen to us.’—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>8</sup> We do not chafe or feel resentment because of receiving constant reminders. Rather, we deeply appreciate their excelling value. (Ps. 119:129) In these critical times, we are thankful that Jehovah keeps sending us reminders to rouse us up spiritually and to motivate us to be zealous in fine works!—2 Pet. 1:12,13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit Assembly Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Beginning in September, the theme for circuit assemblies will be “Listen and Learn to Carry Out God’s Word.” This theme, based on Deuteronomy 31:12, 13, provides a fitting basis for the entire program to highlight lessons we need to learn and apply.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Although most people today listen to misleading inspired expressions, there is a vital need for each of us to listen to God’s Word and learn to carry it out. (Luke 11:28; 1 Tim. 4:1) With this in mind, the circuit assembly program has been designed to provide encouragement and help for publishers, families, elders, and pioneers. On Saturday, there will be a four-part symposium on the subject “Coping With Our Problems—By Paying Attention to God’s Word.” And on Sunday morning, there will be a symposium entitled “How the Scriptures Discipline in Righteousness.” The entire program will present spiritual encouragement that you and your family should not miss.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’On both Saturday and Sunday, practical suggestions for the field ministry will be offered and demonstrated. Encouraging and instructive experiences and interviews will also be presented. Thus, by being present and listening with a view to putting into practice what you learn, you will be in a better position to carry out fully the commands of God’s Word.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> One of the highlights of the circuit assembly will be the baptism of newly dedicated brothers and sisters. Well before this public declaration of their dedication, the candidates should express their desire for baptism to the presiding overseer so that he can arrange for the elders to meet with them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> The public talk for this circuit assembly series is entitled “Why Be Guided by the Bible?” Invite interested persons to attend. In anticipation of the much-needed encouragement and assistance you and your family will receive, make definite plans to be present for the entire program.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> We can be upbuilding to others by what we say. When used properly, our words can be “as apples of gold in silver carvings.&quot; (Prov. 25: 11) By participating in the meetings, we are “encouraging one another.” (Heb. 10:25) Our tongue can be used In a positive way when we share experiences, give commendation, or discuss spiritual matters. Such wholesome use of the tongue ‘is good for building up. Imparting what is favorable to the hearers.’—Eph. 4:29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Talk About Thing* That Ara Upbuilding: </span><span class="font8">At Philippians 4:8, Paul provided hejpful guidelines for our speech. He said we should consider whatever things are true, of serious concern, righteous, chaste, lovable, well spoken of, virtuous, and praiseworthy. We can always be sure that what we say will be true and beneficial to others if it is based on God’s Word. (John 17:17) Our Christian dedication, what we learn at the congregation meetings, the way we fully accomplish our ministry, and other such matters are things of serious concern. Positive conversations about the standards and principles of God’s Word are sure to help us become “wise for salvation.” (2 Tim. 3:15) We can express our appreciation for the chaste conduct practiced by those in Jehovah’s clean organization. We can extol the lovable acts of kindness by our brothers. (John 13:34,35) Things that are well spoken of include the wholesome Christian qualities of faith, joy, peace, and long-suffering that we observe in our brothers. Conversation about such virtuous and praiseworthy things is ‘good for the upbuilding’of others.—Rom. 15:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Every day, we are confronted by the discouraging anxieties of the world. How refreshing to lay these things aside and share loving association with our brothers! The precious time we are able to spend together is a treasure to be cherished. If we are always encouraging and upbuilding, others will truthfully say of us: “They have refreshed my spirit.”—! Cor. 16:18.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul commended the Philippians because they ’revived their thinking in his behalf.’ (Phil. 4:10) If we use their example as a model for the field ministry, we will ‘revive our thinking’ in behalf of those to whom we witness and be prompted to make return visits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> If you placed the brochure “The Government That Will Bring Paradise,” you might say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “I was thinking about the conversation we had the other day. and two scriptures came to mind that I would like to share with you. You may recall that we talked about God taking over the rulership of the earth. In the Bible, Jehovah God has promised that this will take place. [Read Daniel 2:44.] Do you believe that could really happen? [Allow for response.] Listen to what God says about his ability to fulfill his promises. [Read Isaiah 55:11.] Shouldn't that encourage us to put our trust in God’s Kingdom? But when will God fulfill his promises?&quot; Explain that you will answer that question on your next visit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> You might take this approach tvhen making a return visit on a person who took the brochure “When Someone You Love Dies”:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “I made a special effort to return, in view of our discussion about losing someone in death.” Show illustration on page 30 as you say: “Remember this happy scene of people being resurrected and reunited with their loved ones? I left you with the question about where this is to take place, in heaven or on earth. Perhaps you found the Bible’s answer on page 26 of this brochure.&quot; Discuss the main points in the third through the fifth paragraphs, and read John 5:21. 28, 29. As time permits, read any of the remaining scriptures on the page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* Did you start a study in “Look! I Am Making All Things New”? On the return visit, you could do this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ Refer again to page 30, and point to the question: “In what ways is the Bible outstanding?&quot; Turn to pages 3 and 4. and review paragraphs 1-4 as well as the illustration on the cover of the brochure. Read one or two scriptures cited in the footnote on paragraph 4. Explain that the Bible is the only book that offers such a marvelous hope. Make arrangements for your next visit. After the third session, if it looks like the study will continue, you can start reporting a new study!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> You might resume a discussion on “The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever” this way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Previously, I was able to show you God’s name in the Bible. Knowing and using the name Jehovah is a vital part of our worship.&quot; Turn to page 31, review the main points in the last four paragraphs, and read John 17:3 and Micah 4:5. Explain that we provide a Bible study program that can show how God’s name will be sanctified in a proper way and how we can enjoy the blessings of a paradise earth.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> At our district convention this past summer, how delighted we were with the entire program! On Saturday afternoon our joy overflowed when we heard the announcement concerning the new book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life,</span><span class="font6"> and the related information that followed. Earth’s billions of people need knowledge that only God can give —knowledge of God and of his Son, Jesus Christ.—Prov. 2:1-6; John 17:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> How vividly the speaker described portions of the book! The captivating chapter headings, practical illustrations, positive presentation of the truth, uncomplicated questions, and, at the end of each chapter, a box entitled “Test Your Knowledge” are among the features that will appeal to all who read it. But our Bible students will especially benefit as they rapidly acquire the fundamentals of the Bible’s teachings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> During the concluding talks on Saturday and Sunday, we were encouraged to have a family study using this new book. By now, we have likely become acquainted with its contents. No doubt you have also discussed points to have in mind when offering this new book in the field.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Points to Review: </span><span class="font6">You may recall that when presenting the subject “Why Mankind Needs the Knowledge of God,&quot; the speaker emphasized a number of points, including the following; (1) When you use this book to conduct studies, it is not wise to bring in outside material, which could becloud the main points; just concentrate on conveying what the book is proving in each chapter. (2) Chapters are of moderate length so that you will usually be able to cover one each time you study. (3) At the end of each chapter, the questions In the box entitled “Test Your Knowledge&quot; will provide a succinct review.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>5</sup> Um</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> on Bible Studios: </span><span class="font6">Quite a few publishers have inquired whether it is advisable to change their Bible studies over to this new book. If you are well along in the book being studied at present, it would be practical to complete the study of that publication. Otherwise, it is recommended that you switch over to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font6"> book. If you used a brochure or a tract to start a Bible study, Introduce the new book at the appropriate time and use it for the study. More information on the use of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font6"> book will appear in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font6"> in the coming months.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">• Jehovah has provided this new book to help us teach others about the knowledge that leads to everlasting life. Now we need to prepare well and have a full share in the work yet to be done.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul urged us to remain “healthy in the faith.” (Titus 1: 9, 13) At congregation meetings we consider wholesome thoughts and are instructed in how to keep ourselves fully clad in spiritual armor so that we can “stand firm against the machinations of the Devil.&quot;—Eph. 6:11; Phil. 4:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Meetings Provide What Wo Need: </span><span class="font6">Attending congregation meetings regularly is essential to our standing firm. (1 Cor. 16:13) At meetings prayers are offered to thank and to praise God, as well as to petition him in behalf of the congregation and its needs. (Phil. 4: 6, 7) Joining in Kingdom songs uplifts us and enables us to express our sentiments and feelings as we worship Jehovah. (Eph. 5:19, 20) Our fellowship together at the Kingdom Hall before and after meetings encourages us, builds us up, and refreshes us. —1 Thess. 5:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Last April the special talk, “False Religion’s End Is Near,” forcefully impressed upon the minds of truth lovers the urgency of taking immediate action to get out of Babylon the Great. (Rev. 18:4) During June and July, how stimulating it was to cover three </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study articles on the flashes of light that have enlightened the path of the righteous! (Prov. 4:18) Think of what we would have missed had we neglected to attend those meetings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">‘At our “Joyful Praisers” District Convention, stress was laid on the need for education that enhances our ministry. As </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry</span><span class="font6"> points out on page 72, the Theocratic Ministry School is a provision for the ongoing education of the entire congregation. Currently, one feature of the program helps us to become better acquainted with the modernday history of the organization by using the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaimers</span><span class="font6"> book. We cannot afford to miss out on this education.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> Our Service Meeting equips us to be more effective in the ministry. This was Illustrated by the meeting in which we received instructions for sharing in the wide distribution of Kingdom News No. 34. Jehovah’s blessings on this work were abundant, as seen in the exceptional results worldwide. (Compare 2 Corinthians 9:6, 7.) Those regularly attending the meetings were encouraged, and they helped generate the support that was given the campaign.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“At the Congregation Book Study, our sense of urgency is heightened by the things we are learning from God's Word with the aid of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font6"> book. With events moving swiftly on the world scene, we need to understand the fulfillment of the deeper prophecies of Revelation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Give Priority to Rogular Mooting Attendance: </span><span class="font6">In many lands where our brothers are suffering trials, they still recognize how vital it is for them to come together each week. For example, in Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, so many new ones are at the meetings that two or even three times the number of publishers attend. In this way Jehovah helps the brothers to remain firm in one spirit.—Phil. 1:27; Heb. 10:23-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Any who may have been neglecting regular meeting attendance should take steps now to rectify this trend. (Eccl. 4:9-12) In order to stand firm, we need the mutual interchange with mature ones, as provided by regular meeting attendance.—Rom. 1:11.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6">Song 78 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Behave in a Manner Worthy of the Good News</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we desire to bring honor to Jehovah’s name. We know that our conduct, speech, grooming, and clothing can influence how others view true worship. This is especially true when we are at our meetings. We want to make sure that everything that is said and done at the meetings is worthy of the good news and brings honor to Jehovah.—Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Many of the world’s standards for dress and grooming are unacceptable for Christians. This is a matter that should be given careful attention by ministers of the good news. The June 1,1989, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> page 20, stated: “Our clothing need not be expensive, but it should be clean, tasteful, and modest. Our footwear should also be in good repair and of good appearance. Similarly, at </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> meetings, including the Congregation Book Study, our bodies should be clean, and we should be neatly and appropriately dressed.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Punctuality is a mark of loving consideration and thoughtfulness. Occasionally, unavoidable circumstances may prevent us from arriving on time for a meeting. But habitually arriving late may display a lack of respect for the sacred purpose of the meetings and a failure to appreciate our responsibility to avoid disturbing others. Latecomers often distract others and prevent them from getting the full benefit from the program. Punctuality shows respect for the feelings and interests of all In attendance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Love for our neighbors should make us careful to avoid causing distractions during the meetings. Whispering, eating, chewing gum, rattling papers, and making unnecessary trips to the rest room may interfere with the concentration of others and detract from the dignity due Jehovah’s place of worship. It is inappropriate for any to be conducting congregation business or conversing with others unless there is some emergency that requires the brothers to be away from their seats. Otherwise, all should be seated and listening to the program so as to benefit themselves and their families. Poor manners are out of place in the Kingdom Hall because “love . . . does not behave indecently.” —1 Cor. 13:4, 5; Gal. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> The fine behavior of our children at meetings also brings praise and honor to Jehovah’s name. Close supervision by parents is vital. Children should be encouraged to listen and participate. Many parents with young children choose to sit in a location where they can easily exit and care for the needs of their youngsters without unduly distracting others.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">’ Paul admonished: “Behave in a manner worthy of the good news.” (Phil. 1:27) Let us, then, strive to be mannerly and considerate of others when attending meetings. Cooperation by all will ensure that there will be “an interchange of encouragement ... by each one through the other's faith.&quot;—Rom. 1:12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Your Mind Fixed on the Things Above</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Commenting on the generation that surrounds us and its outlook on the future, an article in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span><span class="font6"> of December 31, 1994, stated: “They’re fearing the future. They fear it in terms of Jobs, in terms of disease, in terms of the economy, in terms of world situations.” Everywhere we look, there is a feeling of uncertainty about life. Our ministry as Jehovah’s Witnesses brings us into dally contact with people who feel this way. While we face the same problems as they do, our faith and confidence in the sure promises of God’s Word enable us to have a much different outlook on life and the future of mankind.—Isa. 65:13,14,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Our optimism and outlook of sure hope cause many honestheart-ed people to listen to the message that we bring to them. Many Individuals who feel depressed and downtrodden find it comforting to talk with us. Because they like what they hear, some agree to study the Bible with us. At times, however, people may first want to unburden themselves of their personal problems. While some time may be spent listening to someone’s personal anxieties, we should not lose sight of our objective, which is to teach people the positive truths of God’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> We do want to be sympathetic toward tho§e who are burdened down. Jesus set the example when he said, as recorded at Matthew 11:28: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down.” We want to encourage people in the same manner. Notice, however, at the conclusion of verse 28, Jesus said: “I will refresh you.” That should be our aim. We do that by sharing the refreshing promises from God’s Word. Being a good listener demonstrates our personal interest and concern and is vital to fulfilling our commission to preach the good news of the Kingdom, helping others to realize that the Kingdom is the only sure remedy for all the problems of mankind.—Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Our work is not that of professional health-care experts. Rather, it is as the apostle Paul explained, as noted at 1 Timothy 4:6, a ministry that focuses on “fine teaching,” the teachings that are found in the Word of God. Those having personal or emotional problems may need to be encouraged to lean on Jehovah. Teach them to keep their “minds fixed on the things above’—things that are related to the Kingdom hope. (Col. 3:2) When people keep their attention focused on the Word of God, they can be built up as a result of the powerful influence it exerts in their lives.—Heb. 4:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> So our goal Is to help people concentrate their thinking on things that are ’righteous, chaste, lovable, and praiseworthy.’ (Phil. 4:8) If they focus attention on the Kingdom hope, they will be blessed in the same way as we are. They too will experience the joy that comes with the knowledge that Jehovah will eventually solve all their problems through his Kingdom.—Ps. 145:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Opinions about the Bible’s value are many and varied. However, we are convinced that within its pages lie the answers to mankind’s perplexing problems as well as reliable guidance for our personal course In life. (Prov. 3:5,6) The wisdom of Its counsel is unequaled. The moral standards it advocates are unsurpassed. Its message is powerful, “able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (Heb. 4:12) How can we help others to see the need to take this book off the shelf and give it careful scrutiny? You may wish to try some of the following suggestions when offering the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font6"> with the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible-God’s Word or Man’s?</span><span class="font6"> during November.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Since many people worry about meeting their basic needs, perhaps t this approach would get their atten-j tion:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">*!■ &quot;Many people I talk to these days are Ifrorried about meeting their financial obligations. Many are caught up in the pursuit of material things, and this results In stress. Where is the best place to turn for advice on such matters? [Allow</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6">for response.] I have found that the Bible offers practical advice that can help us avoid unnecessary problems. Let me show you an example.” Turn to page 163 in the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man's?</span><span class="font6"> and read 1 Timothy 6:9,10, quoted in paragraph 3. Make farther comments on paragraph 4, and then offer the book.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Here is another suggestion you might consider: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ftt&quot; •</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Every time we read the paper or listen to the news we hear about another distressing problem that makes us feel anxious. [Mention some disturbing event reported recently in the news.] How can we cope with problems like this? [Allow for response.] Back In 1983 the then president of the United States [Ronald Reagan] said that the Bible has the greatest message ever written and that ‘inside its pages lie all the answers to all the problems that man has ever known.’ What he said brings to mind what the Bible itself states. [Read 2 Timothy 3:16,17.] Let me show you why we can have confidence in the Bible.&quot; Point out some highlights from the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Why</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Trust the Bible.</span><span class="font6"> Offer to return later to discuss how remarkable it is that Bible prophecies are being fulfilled in current world events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'If there are many nonreligious people in your territory, you might try this approach:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Many people In this area view certain holy books as contradictory and as nothing more than myths. They have seen so many bad things done in the name of religion that they do no</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">t trus</span><span class="font6">t even the Bible. In fact, more and more people are wondering whether the Bible is God’s Word or man’s. What is your opinion?” Allow for answer. Depending oh householder’s response, turn to a portion of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man's?</span><span class="font6"> that deals with the objection or viewpoint of the householder, and discuss one or two points. For example, you may have occasion to use paragraphs 27-9 beginning on page 66, under the subheading/Jesus—A Real Person.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>s</sup> Our Grand Instructor has made sure that a knowledge of his will is accessible to all who want to learn. Helping others to appreciate the Bible's real value is one of the best things we can do to help them; it can save their lives—Prov. 1: 32,33.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">‘Jesus provided what his disciples needed. Luke 24:45 reports: “He opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures.&quot; He knew that if they wanted to have his Father’s approval, it was essential for them to study and understand God’s Word, the Bible. (Ps. 1:1,2) Our preaching work has the same objective. Our goal is to start Bible studies, where we can ‘teach people to observe all the things Jesus commanded.’ (Matt. 28:20) With this in mind, the following are some suggestions on what might be helpful when you make return visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> If </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">you initially discussed the book “The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?” you might continue your discussion this way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ “I would like to show you something else that Illustrates the practical value of Bible counsel. Many people find it difficult to get along well with others. What can we do to develop a better relationship with those around us? [After a response, turn to pages 167-8, paragraph 15, and read Matthew 7:12. Add thoughts expressed in paragraph 16.] This is another example of the wisdom found in Bible counsel. The next time I call, I’d like to show you advice the Bible offers to help married couples to find greater happiness in their relationship.&quot; Make arrangements to return to discuss pages 170-2, which show what the Bible recommends for a happy family life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you spoke to someone who showed interest in the Bible, then perhaps this approach might be effective in getting a study started: </span><span class="font6">■ “Virtually all those you talk to will tell you that they would like to have a peaceful and secure world in which to live. If that’s what everybody wants, why do we have a world that’s filled with so much turmoil and violence? [Allow for response.] The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font6">shows you where in the Bible you can find the answer to that question.” Turn to page 1659, and point to “Bible Topics for Discussion” No. 43a, “Who is responsible for world distress.&quot; Read 2 Corinthians 4:4. Explain how God will destroy the Devil and will bring a world of lasting peace and happiness. Read Revelation 21:3,4. You can then say: “The next time I call, I would like to show you some scriptures that explain why you can look forward to a world without distress.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">’ If you used the direct approach to start a study and there was a good response, you might say this when you return:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ “When we spoke previously, we discussed some reasons why it is beneficial to study the Bible. A sincere effort to do more of this can help us appreciate what God has in store for us. [Read John 17:3.] We have developed a Bible study program that hai assisted thousands to learn more about what God has promised and how we can please him.” Display the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font6"> book, review the chapter titles, and demonstrate how we conduct a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> If you can help sincere persons to appreciate the excelling value of God’s Word, you have helped them In the best way possible. The wisdom they can learn by a study of its pages can be “a tree of life,” which will bring them much happiness.—Prov. 3:18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Starting April 24, we began general distribution of the special </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> that has stirred the interest of concerned people everywhere! Its message is not only timely but also </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">urgent.</span><span class="font10"> Publishers In every congregation have expressed wholehearted support, wanting to put this message into the hands of thousands of people. Are you reaching out for a full share?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> A consignment of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font10">was sent to each congregation, supplying approximately 50 for each publisher and 250 for each pioneer. How many have you been able to distribute? If you have not been able to do as much as you had hoped, have you considered ways to do more before the distribution ends on May 14? What about enrolling as an auxiliary pioneer? Can you take advantage of extra meetings for service during the week, such as those for evening witnessing?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> The elders will be carefully reviewing territory coverage. If it will not be possible for the assigned congregation to work some portions, the elders should contact neighboring congregations to enlist help. Our wholehearted efforts, along with good cooperation between congregations, should get the job done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> You have likely experienced extra joy in this work because so many have been able to participate, including new publishers and youngsters. Hopefully, this spirit of Joy will be sustained, encouraging all to follow through by returning to visit those who have responded favorably. We were urged to keep good house-to-house records, taking note of those who manifested Interest. The latter part of May would be a fine time to concentrate on making return visits with a view to starting new studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> What can we say when we go back? You might And It effective to say: “You may recall the printed Information I left with you recently; I hope you had an opportunity to read it and give the matter some thought. Its message has certainly stirred up a lot of discussion in our community, since it touches on vital issues that confront all mankind.” Refer to some of the thought-provoking statements on the second page, and then ask: “What do you think we need to do to make sure we are prepared for what the future will bring?” Allow for response. If Interest is shown, discuss other points on pages 2-4 of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font10"> and offer a Bible study or, if that is not possible, the latest magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If you work in another congregation’s territory, be sure to turn over the names of any interested ones you locate so that return visits can be made by the publishers of that congregation. Likewise, if you are given some calls for follow-up, do not fail to return promptly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">’The special distribution of this </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> has created excitement and motivated all of us to intensify our efforts in the Kingdom-preaching work. We can be confident that it will be a resounding success, heightening the awareness of people everywhere of Jehovah’s great name and purpose. (Isa. 12:4,5) The more we are able to do, the greater will be our joy—Ps. 126:3.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Following Our Exemplar as Light Bear$</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jesus declared concerning himself: “I am the light of the world.&quot; By following his example, Jesus' disciples also were “the light of the world.” (Matt. 5:14) As “the light of the world,” Jesus could say that all who follow </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">him will </span><span class="font10">possess “the.light of life.” (John 8:12) That makes us spiritual light bearers, who must never allow anything to hide or obscure that light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Jehovah’s organization provides training to show us how to be effective light bearers. If we closely follow the counsel and direction we receive, we will be able to enlighten people of all sorts concerning Kingdom truth. (1 Tim. 4:6) Serving as light bearers involves not only talking the truth at every opportunity but also rnalntoin-ing fine conduct as Christians. Our Exemplar’s conduct was above reproach. As his followers, we must demonstrate that Christianity is our everyday way of life. (Eph. 5:9; Titus 2?7, 8, 10) We must produce fine works that others can see, moving them to glorify God. —Matt. 5:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’One Witness encountered an unusual request while going from house to house. The man of the house and his wife were quite ill, but they needed to deposit some money in the bank. They asked if the Witness would do it. He agreed and was given $2,000 in cash to take to the bank! When he returned, he asked: “How could you trust me without even kriowlng me?” The answer: “We know, and everyone else knows, that Jehovah’s Witnesses are the only ones to trust.” How thankful we can be that our adhering closely to the moral principles of the Bible produces such a God-honoring reputation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> A first-grade^ teacher explained to her class why one six-year-old Witness student was not participatingjn coloring Halloween pictures. The teacher said she was very proud of her for having the courage to be different because of what she believes. If we firmly believe something, the teacher commented, we should have the courage to stand up for it. That night the teacher analyzed her own-beliefs, and had to admit that she had not shown the same courage to stand up for her convictions. The next day she announced that she was not </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">going tn tn</span><span class="font10">vnlvp h</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">p</span><span class="font10">r class in any future holiday celebrations, some of which she did not believe In herself!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’Jehovah’s people are eager to let their light shine, no matter where they are. The exemplary conduct of youngsters at school has favorably Impressed schoolmates and teachers. Adult Witnesses who display fine conduct in the neighborhood cause others to speak well of the Kingdom message. Informal witnessing under a multitude of circumstances attracts sincere people who want to learn more. Even our diligence and honesty in sec</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ular</span><span class="font10"> work give a witness. Yes, no matter where we are or what we are doing, we can arouse interest in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> By keeping our eyes on the flawless life-pattern of our great Exemplar, we can continue to perfect our skills as his disciples. Copying his example will ensure that our light “shines upon all.” —Matt. 5:15; 1 Pet. 2:21.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> How many reasons do we have to be joyful? Probably few of us have tried to list all of them. Despite living in a world of turmoil and uncertainty, we have so many reasons to be joyful. As announced in the January 1995 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font0"> “Joyful Praisers” is the encouraging theme for the 1995 district conventions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> We praise Jehovah because he taught us the truth. (Isa. 54:13; John 8:32) In turn, we joyfully share the truth with all who are searching for security and happiness. (Ezek. 9:4; Acts 20:35) Our Christian brotherhood als</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">o brings</span><span class="font0"> us joy. A loving spiritual family brings contentment and happiness. These are just a few of the reasons for our joy that impels us to praise Jehovah. The convention talks and demonstrations will draw our attention to additional Scriptural reasons for joy in these troubled last days.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> A Three-Day Convention: </span><span class="font0">Have you made arrangements with your employer to get time off in order to be in attendance for all three days of the convention? Parents of school-age children who will be attending one of the conventions while school is still in session should respectfully inform teachers that the children will be absent from school on Friday for this important part of their religious worship. Where is the convention nearest you? The February 15,1995, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> listed the dates and locations for all 181 conventions in the United States branch territory. By now your congregation secretary has informed you of the details for your congregation. In addition to English, there will be conventions in Chinese, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and American Sign Language.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> The program will begin on F</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">riday at 9:40 a</span><span class="font0">.m. and conclude on Sunday at approximately 3:50 p.m. On Saturday and Sunday, the program will start at </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">9:30 a.m.</span><span class="font0"> Doors will open at 8:00 a.m. Only those with specific work assignments will be permitted to enter earlier.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Will You Bo In Attendance?: </span><span class="font0">We are urged to attend all three days of the convention. Why is that? Jehovah wants us to be there. Today our faith and spiritual health are under intense bombardment. Paul counseled concerning “not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together” at a time when Christians in Judea were experiencing great pressure. (Heb. 3:12,13; 10:25) The Philippians were living “among a crooked and twisted generation.” Yet, they were “shining as illuminators in the world.” (Phil. 2:15) Why were these first-century Christians different? Because they obediently followed the leadings of holy spirit that directed them to meet together “to incite to love and fine works.”—Heb. 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> The world would influence us otherwise, weakening our desire, to meet with our brothers and praise Jehovah. This summer we are invited to yield to Jehovah’s spirit and enjoy all three days of the convention. Are we determined to be in attendance with our entire family? We need to fortify our love and faith on a regular basis. Jehovah has provided annual conventions to help us in this regard.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Take Home a Treasure: </span><span class="font0">How can you gain the most good, from the convention? In one word the answer is “conc</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">entratio</span><span class="font0">n.&quot; This is no easy task in today’s high-strung, fast-moving society. Energetic young people may find concentration difficult, but it is a challenge all of us face when attending a district convention. We will find concentration to be easier if we plan ahead. Ask yourself, ‘What is the convention theme?’ Meditate on it! ‘Why am I going, and what will I be doing during the three days? Will my evenings be filled with recreation, or have I scheduled sufficient time for rest and review of convention highlights?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> The February 1, 1984, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> article “Do You Meditate or Just Daydream?” offered several suggestions on how to get the most from a meeting and then drew this conclusion: “Mental discipline is perhaps the most important factor.” When a speaker begins, we are usually attentive, but perhaps partway through the talk, we let our mind “slip out of gear.” How can we prevent this from happening?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>9</sup> Suggestions offered in the past bear repeating because they work. If at all possible, try. to get sufficient rest each night. This is not always easy because travel may be involved, and if you are staying in a hotel, you may not retire as soon or rest as well as at home. Good planning will usually allow you to get the needed rest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> Simple note-taking has proved to be an aid in concentration. If you try to take down too much information, some vital points maybe missedentire-ly. As a suggestion, take notes with the object of presenting a summary of the program to a Bible student or a shut-in. Even though you may not have a specific individual in mind, you will have a purpose in taking notes, and after the convention</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY, MAY 1995</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">you may And occasions to present highlights of the program while witnessing informally to unbelieving family members. By taking notes and sharing what you heard, you will not quickly lose the information. Expression increases retention.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>11</sup> Although food will no longer be provided, there is still considerable expense involved in the rental of the convention facility, which often Includes additional cost for public-address equipment, literature, and so forth. How are these expenses covered? Through our voluntary donations, either In cash or by check made payable to “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” This is in harmony with Psalm 96:8 and 2 Chronicles 31:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Joyful Praisers Honor Jehovah by Godly Conduct: </span><span class="font0">Last year encouraging positive comments about our conduct </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font0"> received from motel personnel and the employees of convention facilities. One hotel </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">manag</span><span class="font0">er stated: (It is always a pleasure to accommodate the Witnesses because they are patient and cooperative and keep a close eye on their children.’’ . Another hotel director said the Witnesses seem to be happier and much more organized than other groups. Even though our convention was the largest held in the area, he said: (“We have fewer complaints and difficulties than with groups a firaction of their size.” j</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>13</sup> Another hotel employee disclosed that a recent convention held before ouis resulted in much damage, as well as thievery, even though the facilities were fully staffed. But, regarding our convention, he went onto say: “We don’t have to worry about that with the Witnesses.... When they’re here, we only have to keep one or two maintenance pe</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">ople</span><span class="font0"> on hand and that is oply to repair incidental problems with machinery. ”<sub>y</sub>.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>14</sup> We wish all the reports received were similar, but sadly, that is npt the case. One </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">conventio</span><span class="font0">n chairman observed^“After sessions, many of the teenagers congregate in large numbers in the [hotel] lobby late at night, laughing loudly and yelling. This disturbs other guests..., who appear irritated. Some youn</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">g ones run in t</span><span class="font0">h</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">e c</span><span class="font0">o</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">rrido</span><span class="font0">rs, slamming doors as they visit one another’s rooms and talk very loudly in the rooms.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>15</sup> Anotherjuroblem that has persisted over the years is the large number of brothers visiting in corridors and outside the audit</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">orium during ses</span><span class="font0">sions. At one convention last year, a note from a Bible student was found in the contribution box. It read: (“I have never been so shocked and appalled as I am at the noise, activity, talking, and carrying-on in the hallways during the talks... I’m not yet a Witness, only one who. is studying and learning godly fear and respect.” Surely, none of us would want to leave the impression that we lack appreciation for Jehovah’s provisions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>16</sup> At all times we should ask ourselves: ‘Whom do I represent, and why am I attendffig this convention?’ Our spirituality and godly devotion are reflected in our speech, conduct, and appreciation for spiritual provisions. (Jas. 3:13; 1 Pet. 2:2, 3, 12) Brothers who have endured years of restrictions and bans are often observed to be far more attentive and respectful at conventions, remaining in their seats, absorbed in the talks and demonstrations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> Your Dress and Grooming Send a Message: </span><span class="font0">At 1 Samuel 16:7, we are reminded that “man sees what appears to the eyes; but as for Jehovah, he sees what the heart is.” Thus, people often judge us on the basis of our appearance. Our dress and grooming come under close scrutiny, especially when we are attending a convention for worship and instruction in Christian living. If you are a young person going to school or if your secular employment puts you in close contact with people who follow worldly styles, it may be a challenge to adhere to Christian standards for modest attire.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>18</sup> Standards of dress and grooming vary throughout the world. Christians are expected to wear modest, well-arranged clothing. Who should determine this? Parents should be sure their teenage children do not dress like worldly youths in school. Constructive guidelines have been provided to help us make sound decisions in this sensitive area. We encourage review of the February 8, 1987, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font0"> article “What Do Clothes Mean to You?” What was observed at some of our conventions last year?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>19</sup> After one of the “Godly Fear” District Conventions, we received this observation: “The brothers and sisters have improved considerably in their dress, grooming, and conduct at the convention this year.... There are still certain conditions and habits that need further improvement, however.” After another convention it was reported that immodest dress was very noticeable. The report mentioned that the dress of some was offensive to others. Some outsiders present also noted the immodest dress. The clothing of some was both too revealing and too tight.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>20</sup> The majority of the brothers and sisters wear modest, respectable clothing while at the convention site. Later, however, at hotels or in restaurants, some brothers and sisters, still wearing their badges, were dressed in “tank tops, old denims, short-shorts, and... faddish clothes not becoming to God’s people.” If the elders observe that some have a tendency to dress this way during leisure activity, It would be appropriate to offer kind but firm counsel before the convention that such attire is not appropriate, especially as delegates attending a Christian convention. Please review with your Bible students who will be attending the convention the guidelines on conduct and dress outlined above.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> Hotel*: </span><span class="font0">Each year considerable effort is made to provide accommodations at reduced rates in order not to impose a financial burden on anyone. Please remember to be patient and kind when dealing with hotel employees. We may be tired from travel and the line of those waiting for accommodations may be long, but your patience will not go unnoticed. It would be very beneficial for publishers to review with their Bible students the January 1995 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font0"> insert regarding hotel accommodations. We must also remember the need to tip in an appropriate fashion.—June 22, 1986, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>22</sup> Cameras and Recording Devices: </span><span class="font0">It is fitting to offer kindly reminders about cameras and recording equipment. Please remember, if you plan to use cameras, camcorders, or any type of recording equipment, show consideration for those around you. Moving around during the sessions or even recording from your seat could be distracting to others. No recording devices of any sort are to be connected to the electrical or sound systems, nor should equipment block aisles or walkways. Whether you decide to take pictures or record parts of the program with a camcorder or an audiocassette recorder is a personal matter. Pictures and recordings can bring back fond memories when viewed at a later date. All such equipment should be used conservatively, in a way that does not distract others or hinder you from gaining the most benefit from the program. After you return home, will there be time to review the recordings? You may find that taking notes will suffice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>23</sup> Seating: </span><span class="font0">At the 1994 “Godly Fear” District Convention, did you note improvement in the matter of saving seats? Some progress has been made, but we still need to be conscious of this reminder: SEATS MAY BE SAVED ONLY FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ANY WHO MAY BE TRAVELING WITH YOU IN YOUR CAR. We are there as guests of the Society. The rental of the auditorium has been paid for by voluntary donations. Would it be loving and considerate to save a seat that we are not sure will be occupied? We are sorry that it will not be possible for us to accommodate requests for separate areas or rooms for those with environmental problems, such as allergies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>24</sup> Each convention makes provision for those with special needs, such as the elderly and the physically disabled. Please be sure not to occupy seats in one of these sections if you do not qualify. Also, be alert to assist those with special needs to find a seat if they are not accompanied by someone responsible for their care.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> Caring for Your Convention Food Noeda: </span><span class="font0">As you know, the December 1994 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font0"> announced: “Beginning with the 1995 district conventions and the September 1995 circuit assemblies and special assembly days, there will be no food served. Each one is to bring his own food and drink.” Then the February 1995 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font0"> insert explained why this adjustment has been made and gave fine suggestions as to how everyone can care for his own food and drink needs at the convention. It would be good for all not only to review that insert themselves but also to go over it with their Bible students as they prepare to attend the convention. It is important that Bible students be informed that all attending should bring their own food and drink to the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>26</sup> Just to emphasize some points, you will want to remember these suggested items to bring for the noon break: light, simple, and nourishing lunch items similar to what people often take with them to a secular job, such as cold sandwiches, dried fruits, nuts, baked items, and fresh fruit. Liquids may include coffee, soft drinks, fruit juices, or bottled water, in a nonbreakable container or a thermos. If small coolers are necessary, they are acceptable if they will fit under your seat. However, no large family-size picnic coolers, alcoholic beverages, or glass containers should be brought into the convention facility. Eating or snacking during the program sessions should be avoided. This would show disrespect for the spiritual meal being served.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>27</sup> An additional caution is that no cooking is to be done in hotel rooms unless they have a kitchenette for that purpose. It is good to reflect on the fact that the time allowed for the noon break is designed so that we can take in light refreshment and enjoy theocratic association with our brothers and sisters. As Jehovah’s people, we recognize that the spiritual food at the conventions is of primary importance in comparison with material things, and we should plan accordingly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>28</sup> On June 2,1995, the first of the “Joyful Pralsers” District Conventions will begin. Have you completed your preparations, and are you now ready to enjoy three days of happy fellowship and spiritual good things? It is our sincere prayer that Jehovah will bless your efforts to attend this summer’s convention with your brothers and sisters as we dwell on how to be joyful praisers of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>ninders</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Baptism: </span><span class="font0">Baptismal candidates should be in their seats in the designated section before the program begins on Saturday morning. It has been observed that some wear types of attire that are not dignified and detract from the occasion. A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">modest</span><span class="font0"> bathing suit and a towel should be brought by each one who plans to be baptized. After the baptism talk and prayer by the speaker, the session chairman will give brief instructions to the candidates and will then call for a song. After the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">last</span><span class="font0"> stanza, the attendants will direct the candidates to the immersion site. Since baptism in symbol of one’s dedication is an intimate and personal matter between the individual and Jehovah, there is no provision for so-called partner baptisms in which two or more baptismal candidates embrace or hold hands while being baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Badge Cards: </span><span class="font0">Please </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wear</span><span class="font0"> the 1995 badge card at the convention and while traveling to and from the convention site. This often makes it possible for us to give a fine witness while traveling. Badge cards and holders should be obtained through your congregation, as they will </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font0"> be available at the convention. Remember to carry your current Advance Medical Directive/Release card. Bethel family members and pioneers should have their identification cards with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rooming: </span><span class="font0">We are asking for the cooperation of everyone in using ONLY the listing of accommodations provided by the convention. If we bypass the Society’s arrangement and secure a hotel not on the approved list or pay more than the agreed-upon rate at one of the listed hotels, we undermine much of the hard work of our brothers who negotiate with the hotels for better rates. IF YOU EXPERIENCE A PROBLEM WITH A HOTEL, please do not hesitate to bring it to the attention of the Rooming Department overseer at the convention so that he can assist you in resolving the matter right away. Congregation secretaries should be sure that Special Needs Room Request forms are promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should immediately notify both the landlord or hotel and the convention Rooming Department so that the room can be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Baby Strollers and Lawn Chairs: </span><span class="font0">In many locations, baby strollers cannot be used in places of public assembly. Fire regulations prohibit placing them in corridors and aisles or between rows of seats. Since large crowds may cause congested conditions, baby strollers are potentially dangerous not only to the baby but also to any who may stumble over them. So please do not bring them to the convention site. However, infant or car seats are permissible, since these can be secured in seats next to the parents. Also, please do not bring lawn chairs. They are dangerous and are not allowed at large public facilities. Your cooperation in these matters is appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Service: </span><span class="font0">Can you set aside some time at the convention to assist in one of the departments? Serving our brothers, if only for a few hours, can be very helpful and bring a good measure of satisfaction. If you can assist, please report to the Volunteer Service Department at the convention. Children under 16 years of age can also make a fine contribution by working under the direction of a parent or other responsible adult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Words of Caution: </span><span class="font0">By keeping alert to potential problems, we can save ourselves unnecessary difficulty. Often thieves and other unscrupulous Individuals will prey on people who are away from their home environment. Be sure your vehicle is locked </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">at all times,</span><span class="font0"> and never leave anything visible to tempt someone to break in. Thieves and pickpockets focus their attention on large gatherings. It would not be wise to leave any valuables at your seat. You cannot be sure that everyone around you is a Christian. Why offer any temptation? Reports have been received of attempts made by some outsiders to lure children away. KEEP YOUR CHILDREN IN SIGHT AT ALL TIMES.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cable television that is available in many hotels often features lewd, pornographic movies. Be alert to this snare, and do not permit children to have unsupervised access to the television in the room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Please do not phone the management of the convention auditorium seeking information about any convention matters. If the information is not available from the elders, please write to the convention address found on the back of the Special Needs Room Request forms on file with each congregation secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ Literature to be used during </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May: </span><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines. For territory that Is covered frequently, any brochure (except the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font10"> brochure) may also be used.

If the presiding overseer’s address is being changed, please send a completed Presiding Overseer Change of Address form (S-29) to the Society immediately, since </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> is sent to the presiding overseer’s address.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Question box</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">■ What items should we take to meetings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Each week we receive beneficial instruction and encouragement at congregation meetings. (Isa. 48:17; Heb. 10:24,25) How much we benefit, however, depends largely on whether we come well prepared or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It would be good for each family member to have his own study material and other Items needed for the meetings. This would include a Bible, a songbook, the publica-tion(s) being studied, a notebook, and a pen or pencil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the Theocratic Ministry School, the Theocratic Ministry School Schedule and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook</span><span class="font10"> are needed. These items help us to keep in mind the theme of the student talks being given and to follow the school overseer when he gives counsel. We can make personal application of the counsel and suggestions in order to improve our own talks and field service presentations. Since January, most of the Instruction talks are based on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's Witnesses—Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom.</span><span class="font10"> It may not be practical for every family member to take his own copy; perhaps one volume could be brought so that the family will have it available for reference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the Service Meeting, we need to have the current Our </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font10"> and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font10"> book. Take along any publications referred to during the meeting, such as literature items that will be used in presentations to be demonstrated. Elders should have a copy of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Parents should endeavor to have their children sit still and pay attention at congregation meetings. Providing them with personal copies of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and other publications, even before they are able to read, encourages them to take an interest. When young ones are taught to respect theocratic publications and to use them, lifelong, wholesome spiritual habits are formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The joy and satisfaction we derive from congregation meetings are greatly enhanced when we come fully equipped. (2 Tim. 3:17) This is the best way to ensure that we are “filled with the accurate knowledge of [God’s] will in all wisdom and spiritual comprehension.”—Col. 1:9.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Keep a Record of Not-at-Homes?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> A Witness couple were out in field service early In the day. Later that same day, they returned to cover their not-at-homes in that territory. One man invited them In and listened Intently. He took a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font10"> book and asked if the Witnesses would return. He had never talked with Jehovah’s Witnesses before and had many questions he wanted answered; a Bible study was started. This couple were oveijoyed to locate such a sheeplike individual. Would you like to have an experience such as that? Keeping a good record of not-at-homes and returning promptly may make it possible for you to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> We have repeatedly been urged to keep an accurate record of not-at-homes and to call again soon. As the above experience shows, another visit on the same day may bring excellent results. While we may be intent on covering the assigned territory. perhaps we are not as diligent in keeping a record of those who are not at home. Some say: ‘We work our territory every two or three weeks; there is no need to keep such a record because we will be back very soon anyway.’ But that gives us even more reason to keep a record. Where territory coverage is frequent, following up notat-homes enables us to be more thorough in searching out deserving ones. How so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> In many areas, 50 percent or more of the residents are not at home during the day. So, in effect, we make more territory available by concentrating more on our not-at-homes. Even if the territory is seldom worked, we can improve the results when an effort is made to reach everyone before marking the territory as having been worked.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Calling on not-at-homes can usually be arranged for another day, preferably within a week. Many find it better to return on a day and at a time different from when the Initial call was made. You may choose to use some time on Saturday or Sunday to follow up not-at-homes noted during the week. Then again, many congregations find that making such calls in the early evening hours has been fruitful. They may find more than half the residents at home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> You should list return visits in your personal records. If you are unable to get back to where no one was at home, your record of not-at-homes should be given to the brother handling the group, for use by the next group going into that territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">‘Giving closer attention to this feature of our ministry can increase our productivity as well as our joy. It can give us the satisfaction that comes with knowing that we are thorough in searching out and caring for sheeplike ones.—Ezek. 34: 11-14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Good News for the Meek Ones</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> We live in a time of impending judgment. (Ezek. 9:5, 6) It is urgent that meek people everywhere be informed so that they can prepare for what is coming. In his loving-kindness, Jehovah has commissioned his people “to tell good news to the meek ones.&quot; (Isa. 61:1, 2) Our magazines help us declare this good news far and wide.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> provide solid spiritual food that strengthens and motivates us. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> comforts meek ones with the good news that God’s Kingdom will soon turn the earth into a paradise. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world. Widespread distribution of these journals is one of the fastest ways to bring the good news to the meek ones. What talking points can we highlight in the latest issues?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> You could present the May 1 “Watchtower&quot; by pointing to the article “Benefiting From Daily</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bible Reading” and asking the question:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “What benefit do you think we can derive from reading the Bible? [Allow for response.] The Bible itself, at Romans 15:4, helps us to reason on that question. [Read Romans 15:4.] Most people in our community have a Bible, but few find time to read it regularly. We believe that the only sure hope for the future is to be found in the Bible, and we will be blessed if we read it.&quot; Make additional appropriate comments, and then offer the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'The May 15 “Watchtower” features an intriguing article entitled: “A New Life for Our Ancestors.” You might be able to stir interest with this introduction:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “Many have often wondered what their ancestors were like. Since they are dead and gone, most people conclude that we will never know. Do you think there is any possibility that we will ever get to know our ancestors?” Allow for response. Read John 5:28, 29, and explain how God has promised to give them a new life in a paradise earth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> You could offer the May 8 “Awake!” by asking a question: </span><span class="font10">■ “What do you think it would take to make life really worth living?&quot; Allow for response. Refer to the article “What Is the Meaning of Life?”, page 26, and read Solomon’s words at Ecclesiastes 2:11. Then, point out his advice at chapter 12, verse 13.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> If you are working with the magazines prior to May 14, be sure to carry copies of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> No. 34 and offer them to anyone who has not yet received a copy. In distributing the magazines, we should remember that householders are welcome to give a small contribution toward the support of our work if they wish. We should always be ready to share our literature, realizing that it may be read by others in the family as well as by friends who may visit them.

<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Before executing his righteous Judgments, Jehovah always gives warning and provides the meek ones with a way of escape. In Ezekiel's day, there were those who were sighing and groaning about all the detestable things being done. Jehovah caused such deserving ones to be marked for deliverance. (Ezek. 9:4-6) Our preaching work today accomplishes the same purpose. We can play an Important role.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> In following up the placement of “The Watchtower,” you could focus on its main theme:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">■ “Note that on the front cover of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> appears the statement ‘Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom.’ What makes this magazine unique is that it advocates God’s Kingdom as the only solution to the world’s problems. It explains what God’s Kingdom will accomplish when God’s will is done on earth. This is the good news that Jesus said would be declared in all the earth.&quot; Read Matthew 24:14, and explain how </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> can be obtained regularly and used for personal Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* You might prefer to focus simply on the Bible itself and stress the need to read it regularly. You could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “It seems that Just about everyone we know would appreciate some practical advice on how to cope with the problems of everyday living. Where do you think we can'find advice that we can trust? [Allow for response.] Many who have put their trust in the advice of friends or who have paid for professional counsel have been sadly disappointed. On the other hand, millions of people have found the Bible to be the only source of advice they can really trust. The Bible provides instruction on how to cope with any problem we may face. [Read 2 Timothy 3:16,17.] Although you may have found the Bible difficult to understand, let me show you how you can use it to open up a treasure-house of wise counsel.&quot; Continue by turning to &quot;Love&quot; in the section “Bible Words Indexed” In the back of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font10"> and point out some of the references that show how love can help us resolve differences with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> With the goal of starting a Bible study, you might choose to use the book &quot;You Can Live Foreverin Paradise on Earth, ” using this introduction:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ “We love our families and want the best for them. How would your family benefit from living in a world like this?&quot; Show the illustrations on pages 156-7. Read one or two of the scriptures quoted on those pages, and explain that these are promises made by Jehovah God, who cannot lie. Refer to the list of chapters on pages 5-6, and ask the householder which subject Interests him most; turn to the chapter he selects, and discuss one or two paragraphs.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Always Plenty to Do</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s people are busy people. We have many obligations in connection with our family, employment, and school. And above all, there is always “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15:58) We must prepare for and attend weekly congregation meetings. We are encouraged not to let a week go by without having some share in the field ministry. Sufficient time must be regularly set aside for personal and family Bible study. Elders and ministerial servants have many congregation assignments. At times we are asked to help worthy ones in need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Occasionally, some of us may feel overwhelmed by all that we have to do. Yet, the busiest people can be among the happiest if balance and proper perspective are maintained. —Eccl. 3:12,13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> The apostle Paul was one who had plenty to do. While caring for his own personal needs by working secularly as a tentmaker, he labored in excess of the other apostles. He worked tirelessly as an evangelizer, preaching publicly and from house to house, while not neglecting his responsibilities as a shepherd of the flock. (Acts 20:20, 21, 31, 34, 35) Despite his busy schedule, Paul was always eager to do more in Jehovah’s service.—Compare Romans 1:13-15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’ Paul maintained his balance and a happy heart by relying on Jehovah for strength. He found his ministry to be rewarding and satisfying. (Phil. 4:13) He knew that God would not forget his work. (Heb. 6:10) The joy of helping others to know Jehovah energized him. (1 Thess. 2:19, 20) The assurance of realizing his Bible-based hope Impelled him to remain industrious. —Heb. 6:11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> We should also consider the good that results from our labors. Our presence at and participation in weekly meetings serve to upbuild and encourage others. (Heb. 10:24,25) Our earnest efforts to reach all with the good news contribute to the advancement of the congregation as interest is cultivated and new ones associate with us. (John 15:8) Assisting others in need promotes a close-knit, familylike spirit in the congregation. (Jas. 1:27) Furthermore, like Paul, we should never forget that being busy in profltable works is well pleasing to Jehovah God. We deem it a grand privilege to serve him. For us there is no better way of life!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> There is an added benefit in having plenty to do. When we are busy pursuing a healthy spiritual routine, time seems to go by much faster. Realizing that each day that passes brings us closer to the new world, we gladly accept the full life we enjoy now. We also realize the wisdom of staying busy, inasmuch as we have less time to get involved in futile worldly pursuits.—Eph. 5:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Surely, there is plenty to do in the work of the Lord. But we can remain happy if we continue to rely on Jehovah God and Jesus Christ, who make our service refreshing and rewarding. —Matt. 11:28-30; 1 John 5:3.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Study—A Matter of Concern</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> What matters give us cause for serious concern? We should be intensely concerned about building and maintaining a close relationship with Jehovah. Personal study plays a major role in developing such intimacy. Today, few of us have the circumstances that permit spending long periods of time in meditation and personal study. Yet, if we do not read God’s Word regularly, we can become weakened to the point of not having the strength to resist the spirit of the world and its fleshly desires.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Form a Longing for the Word: When we first learned about God’s purposes, likely we were eager to acquire more knowledge. Over a period of time, however, our hunger for spiritual nourishment may have become dull. There may be a need to “forma longing” for spiritual food. (1 Pet. 2:2) How can we develop such a longing?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> The aroma of a favorite food will stir hunger pangs because of pleasant memories. Brief periods of personal study can affect us in a similar way spiritually. Enjoying a few tasty spiritual morsels may whet our appetite for deeper truths. The satisfaction that comes with learning may encourage us to dig deeper into Jehovah’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Develop a Routine That Works Best for You: Some set aside an entire evening to 0o personal study, while others prefer shorter and more frequent periods of study. If you find that you can concentrate better in the early morning hours, you may decide to do some studying before breakfast. If you are more alert in the evening, you may choose to do your studying before retiring at night. Whatever the case, the important thing is to be regular and stick to the routine best suited to your needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> When we are encouraged to do more personal study, we may be quick to point out that we already have a full schedule. However, all of us need to be honest In evaluating how we spend our time. Are many hours consumed each day watching television programs? Are we willing to sacrifice some personal interests? A realistic examination of how we use our time will likely reveal daily periods that could be used more profitably in personal study.—Eph. 5:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> The study of God’s Word deserves our undivided attention. Trying to do something else at the same time minimizes the benefits. If we are inclined to study while eating, listening to the radio, or watching television, we are not likely to be absorbed in what we are trying to learn. (1 Tim. 4:15) So there is a need to get rid of distractions.—See </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook, </span><span class="font8">pages 33-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Daily study and application of Bible counsel are important because that is the way we receive guidance from Jehovah. Make it your goal to get the truth off the printed page and into your heart. Take advantage of every opportunity, no matter how brief, to read, review, or meditate on spiritual things.—Deut. 6:6-8; Col. 1:9,10.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1995 “Joyful Praisers” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> What a joy it was to be among the 1,481,258 who attended the “Godly Fear” District Conventions in the United States branch territory this past summer! A total of 13,742 expressed proper godly fear by being baptized. How encouraging it will be to assemble next summer for the three-day 1995 “Joyful Praisers” District Conventions! That intriguing theme should truly motivate us to make every effort to attend along with our Bible students. The program will prove to be a real source of spiritual refreshment for all of us as we continue faithfully serving Jehovah in this time of the end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Be sure to make your convention arrangements well in advance so that you can be there to enjoy all three days of the delightful spiritual program, from the opening song to the closing prayer. Lovingly include in your plans those who may need assistance, especially newly interested ones, so that they too can be present at every session. It would be very helpful to consider the information in this insert with any Bible students who may plan to attend. (Gal. 6:6,10) The program starts with music at 9:40 a.m. on Friday and ends at approximately 4:30 p.m. The Saturday program begins at 9:30 a.m. and closes with song and prayer at approximately 4:40 p.m. The morning session on Sunday begins at 9:30, and the day’s program concludes at approximately 3:50 in the afternoon. The following information will assist you with your preliminary preparations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Instructions for Obtaining Rooms</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> After the Service Meeting for the week of January 2, congregations should post on the information board the Recommended Lodging Locations list for the district convention to which the congregation is assigned. This list gives all the motels presently cooperating with the Society’s rooming arrangements. Your cooperation with these arrangements will assist the convention organization in its efforts to provide sufficient rooming accommodations for everyone at reasonable prices.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To Obtain a Room</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Phone the motel of your choice </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font9"> the Recommended Lodging Locations list is posted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Identify yoiirself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Be prepared to send one night’s deposit immediately after reservation is made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">■ If all motels or dormitories are filled, please wait patiently for the next list.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> What You Should Do: </span><span class="font9">After—NOT before—your congregation posts the Recommended Lodging Locations list containing the addresses, phone numbers, and agreed-upon rates of the motels, you are free to phone the motel of your choice from the list and make reservations. Identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower convention will qualify you for the rates listed, which in most cases are greatly reduced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> One night’s DEPOSIT IS REQUIRED to hold the room. Your deposit should be sent directly to the motel AS SOON AS you make reservations. If your deposit is not received by the motel, your reservations can be canceled at any time. MOTELS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO HOLD ROOMS WITHOUT A DEPOSIT. If you must cancel your reservation, you should immediately notify the motel, making the room available for other delegates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> If the motel you call first is filled, call your next selection from the list and so on. Often, everyone calls the motels closest to the convention facility being used; therefore, you may find it beneficial to try some motels farther away. These also have quality rooms at lower rates. The convention Rooming Department will continue to provide the congregations with revised lists, deleting motels that have been filled and listing additional motels until everyone has a room. Thus, if all the motels on the list are filled, please wait patiently for the next list, and you will be able to obtain a room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Dormitories: </span><span class="font9">A few conventions use school dormitories in addition to motels in order to accommodate everyone. Usually, congregations will receive information on these a month or so after receiving the first motel listing. Those needing such accommodations should follow the instructions on the list sent to the congregations.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Special Needs</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> This provision is only for exemplary publishers, including their well-behaved children, who are approved by the Congregation Service Committee. Arrangements to care for persons with special needs should be made by the congregation where they attend meetings, not shifting this obligation to the convention organization. Elders and others who are aware of the individual circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often requires that publishers consider the needs of those in full-time service, the elderly, the infirm, and perhaps others. Publishers may extend help by taking such ones with them or caring for their needs in other ways.—Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3: 17,18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> Of course, the Rooming Department will endeavor to provide suitable rooming accommodations for publishers with special needs if they cannot be assisted by those in the congregation. These publishers may discuss their situation with the congregation secretary. The secretary should speak with the Congregation Service Committee to see if it is possible for the congregation to assist these individuals in caring for their own rooming accommodations. If the congregation is unable to render the needed assistance, the secretary may give such persons a copy of the Special Needs Room Request form. Only those with special needs should fill out this form. It is to be filled out by the person making the request. It should be returned to the secretary, who will check it for completeness, accuracy, and verification of the circumstances that qualify the person for such consideration. The circumstances are to be EXPLAINED IN DETAIL by the secretary in the space provided on the form. All of this should be done well ahead of the convention. The secretary will then forward the form to the Rooming Department. The individual making the request will be notified directly about the accommodations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> Those with special needs should not go to the convention and request a room when they arrive because the Rooming Department must have the verification of the Congregation Service Committee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> Private-home accommodations are set aside for those who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who can afford motel rooms but who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money. Furthermore, it is not proper for those making such requests to presume upon the hospitality of brothers by expecting to be accommodated additional days before or after the convention. These rooms are provided for the convention period ONLY. Those receiving such accommodations should be sure that they and their children act respectfully toward the home of their host and not rummage through or damage the host’s possessions or enter private areas of the home. If householders experience problems along this line, these should immediately be brought to the attention of the rooming overseer at the convention, and he will be happy to help.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Delegates Attending From Outside the Assigned Area</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>12</sup> In nearly every case, the location assigned for you to attend is the one nearest your congregation. Arrangements for having adequate seating, literature, rooming accommodations, and so forth, are based on the premise that the majority of publishers will attend the convention to which their congregation is assigned. However, if for good reason you will be attending a convention other than the one assigned and need accommodations, the congregation secretary can give you the address for that convention headquarters from the list on the back of the Special Needs Room Request form. Then you can request in writing a copy of the motel listing for that location, sending along a stamped, selfaddressed envelope. Upon receipt of this list, you should use it to make your reservation.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Your Cooperation Needed</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>13</sup> The success of this rooming arrangement depends on the cooperation of all of those involved. (Heb. 13:17) Thus, we are asking everyone to cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement and USE ONLY THE MOTELS ON THE RECOMMENDED LODGING LOCATIONS LIST FOR THIS YEAR so that major difficulties we still experience in negotiating with the motels can be prevented. We have made contracts with the motels on the list, stating that our people will be using them. It is a guarantee that they will get the business if they make special rates for us. Most publishers are taking to heart the clear direction that has been given in previous convention inserts, and many good results are being experienced. However, it is still necessary to request that everyone PLEASE OBSERVE</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">WAYS YOU CAN COOPERATE, as noted in the box on page 6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>14</sup> On the other hand, IF YOU EXPERIENCE A PROBLEM WITH A MOTEL, please do not hesitate to bring it to the attention of the Rooming Department overseer at the convention so that he can assist you in resolving the matter right away.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>15</sup> The convention organization is working hard to save our brothers as much expense as possible. It is therefore in the best interests of all to cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement so that this provision can continue. The listing gives a choice of good-quality accommodations at motels that cooperate. With this arrangement our aim is to help delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Ways You Can Cooperate</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Do not call motels in the convention city to ask them if they are on the current list or have special Watchtower rates for the convention. Also, please do not use the same motel year after year without first checking to see that it is definitely on the current list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Do not accept a higher price for a motel room than what is quoted, on the current list.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Please do not make reservations at a motel you do not intend to use or at more than one motel with the idea of checking them, selecting the best, and canceling the others. (Matt. 5:37) This is unfair, as it prevents the motels from getting business they could have had and deprives other publishers of the use of those rooms, which are often vitally needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Do not reserve rooms for yourself or others without giving names and immediately sending the deposit for each room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">■ Do not put more people in the room than the law and the management allow, which is normally no more than four or five persons, including children. Remember, you are paying a rate based on the number of persons you AGREED would be in the room.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Sign Language Conventions</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>16</sup> Considering the success of American Sign Language conventions last year, we are happy to announce that the same provision will be made this year. The program parts will not be interpreted but will be given in American Sign Language by qualified brothers. This means that the entire convention program will be conveyed directly to those in attendance, who will also be able to enjoy very upbuilding fellowship. In view of this, NO PROVISION for any type of sign language will be made at any other conventions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>17</sup> It is important that all deaf individuals IMMEDIATELY begin making plans to attend one of these two sign-language district conventions. The elders should diligently check with each deaf person in their congregation to be sure that these know about this arrangement and to determine whether any assistance is needed so that they can attend.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Note to Body of Elders: </span><span class="font9">Please read the Society’s December 15, 1994, convention assignment letter and the first and last paragraphs of the Recommended Lodging Locations list for your congregation during the Service Meeting for the week of January 2. After that meeting, post the letter and the list on the information board. Elders are NOT to change their Service Meeting to an earlier night for this week. NO ONE, INCLUDING THE ELDERS, SHOULD MAKE MOTEL RESERVATIONS BEFORE THIS SERVICE MEETING. In this way all congregations will receive the information the same week. To the extent possible, the congregation secretary should handle convention-related material and announcements on future Service Meetings unless otherwise specified or he is unable to do so.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Announcements</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">■ Literature to be used during January: Any 192-page book published prior to 1982 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that do not have the older books in stock should offer </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">True Peace and Security —How Can You Find It?</span><span class="font8"> February: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth </span><span class="font8">will be featured. Placements of this book should be followed up with return visits, and efforts should be made to start Bible studies. March: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!</span><span class="font8"> April and May: The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">magazines. For territory that is covered frequently, any brochure (except the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font8"> brochure) may be used. Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S-14). The pre-1982 publications mentioned above are not available in Brooklyn.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">■ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to celebrate the Memorial this year on Friday, April 14, after sundown. While it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial celebration, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. The Memorial should not start so late that newly interested people find it inconvenient to attend. Further, the schedule should not be so tight that there is no time before or after the celebration to greet visitors, make arrangements for continued spiritual assistance for some, or enjoy a general interchange of encouragement. After thoroughly considering all factors, the elders should decide what arrangements will best help those who attend the Memorial to benefit fully from the occasion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">■ On Sunday, April 23,1995, a special public talk will be given in all congregations. The title will be “False Religion’s End Is Near.” Be sure to Invite all those who attend the Memorial this year. A special effort will be made to help the millions of students with whom home Bible studies are being conducted. Information to be presented following the meeting that day will stimulate them and our brothers in general to anticipate having a share in distributing a special tract. At the same time, it will point out problems individuals are facing and the need to act decisively in accord with God’s Word.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ Starting in February, and no later than March 5, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Divine Teaching Triumphs Worldwide.” This will be a slide presentation highlighting the special international “Divine Teaching” Conventions that were held during the 1993 and 1994 service years. In those areas where the slides will not be made available until a later date, circuit overseers will give the talk “Trust in the God of All Comfort” and continue with it until such time as the slides are received. When all congregations have had the slide talk, circuit overseers will continue giving the talk “Trust in the God of All Comfort” until the next new circuit overseer talk is scheduled for early in 1996. ■ At the Service Meeting the week of January 9, all baptized publishers present will have made available to them a personal copy of the Advance Medical Directive/Release card and Identity Cards for their children.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Consideration for Others—Part 1</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> We rejoice to' see the prosperity of Jehovah’s people, which has resulted in a growing number of congregations. In some areas, especially in larger cities, a strain has been put on Kingdom Hall facilities, sometimes requiring several congregations to use the same Kingdom Hall. This situation calls for extra consideration on the part of all involved.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Each congregation using the Kingdom Hall should leave it in neat and orderly condition for the brothers who come in next. The chairs should be put in order, any literature on the counter should be put away, and any personal items left around the Kingdom Hall should be collected. The rest rooms should be left in tidy condition, making sure that soap, towels, and paper supplies have been replenished and trash receptacles emptied.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> When another meeting is scheduled to start shortly, those remaining after an earlier meeting should not tarry unnecessarily, interfering with preparations for the next meeting. Extended social conversation may result in overcrowding in the lobby and delay the brothers in getting things organized for the next meeting. Parking space around the Kingdom Hall may be limited, and it would be a kindness to leave promptly so that those coming in will have a place to park. On the other hand, those attending the next meeting should not arrive too early, causing unnecessary congestion in the lobby, cloakroom, and parking lot.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Where several congregations are involved, there is a special need for close cooperation in making arrangements for weekly cleaning of the Kingdom Hall. Usually, the congregations take turns for a designated period. When your congregation has that responsibility, make sure that the cleaning is done thoroughly and promptly. The other congregations using the hall will then have no cause for complaint.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Occasionally there is a need for each congregation to change its meeting times, such as when the circuit overseer visits. If another congregation is affected, the elders should advise the other congregation well in advance so that they can inform their publishers as early as possible. Also, if some authorized activity, such as a Pioneer Service School, a meeting of the circuit elders, or a wedding, is scheduled, the other congregations and any circuit overseers affected should be consulted well in advance; they will thus not schedule use of the Kingdom Hall at the same time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> There are quite a number of halls used by congregations assigned to different circuits. It is essential that the traveling overseers visiting these halls keep one another informed about upcoming visits that are being scheduled. Last-minute adjustments or other difficulties can result when two traveling overseers schedule visits during the same week.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Loving consideration for others, good communication, advance planning, and cooperation will help to maintain a warm relationship between congregations and will ensure that “all things take place decently and by arrangement.”—1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Good Use of Our Older Books</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah has provided us with an abundance of rich spiritual food. Much of this material has been in the form of 192-page books that have been published in recent years. During January we will be offering any 192-page book that was published prior to 1982. Do you have some of these at home that are still in good condition? Does the congregation have some in stock? If so, it would be good to review their contents and pick out some talking points you can use in your presentation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> If you are using the book “Let Your Kingdom Come, ” you might begin by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Christians have prayed for the coming of God’s Kingdom for almost 2,000 years. What do you think the Kingdom will do for mankind? [Allow for response. Turn to the box on page 25, and point out some of the blessings that will be realized under Kingdom rule.] This book discusses things the Kingdom will accomplish and explains how you and your loved ones can benefit. If you would like to read it, I will be pleased to leave you a copy.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you are featuring the book “Happiness—How to Find It,” you might try this approach:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Most people have difficulty finding happiness in this world because there are so many problems. Do you think it is possible to be happy under present conditions? [Allow for response. Turn to page 41, and point out some common problems that give us cause for anxiety.] The Bible shows how we can cope with these problems and eventually enjoy unending happiness in a peaceful new world. [Turn to page 190, and read Isaiah 32:17, 18.] The Bible gives specific counsel that can help us find greater happiness in living. This book reviews that counsel and explains how we can apply it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'If you are using the book “True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?,” you might like to try this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Everyone would like to live in a world where there Is peace and security. Sad to say, we have not experienced that in our lifetime. What do you think we need to do to make peace and security a reality? [Allow for response.] God has the power to bring peace to this earth, and he has promised that he will do it.” Turn to the picture on page 98, and then read Micah 4:3, 4. If there is good response, explain more about the Kingdom hope, offer the book, and make arrangements for a return visit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> You might choose to use the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” If so, you could say this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Many people wonder why God permits so much suffering in the world. Since he is almighty, why doesn’t he do something to bring an end to our distress? How do you feel? [Allow for response.] The Bible assures us that God has not abandoned us.” Turn to page 27, paragraph 22, and read Psalm 37:11, 29. Point out the appealing illustration depicting what we can look forward to. If the brochure is accepted, offer to return to show how it can be used for Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Our literature has motivated thousands of people to examine the Bible more closely. What they have learned has brought them hope for a happy future. (Ps. 146:5) It is our privilege to help them.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Show You Care by Making Return Visits</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">'Searching out interested persons from door to door demonstrates your desire to give others the opportunity to hear the Kingdom message. So be sure to follow up the literature placements you make during the month of January, as this is a fine way to show you care about others.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> If you left the book “Let Your Kingdom Come,&quot; you could try to resume your conversation this way:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Previously we talked about God’s Kingdom and what It will do for us. That Kingdom will soon make this earth a paradise. Since we have never seen a paradise, it may be hard to visualize it. Here is what it might look like. [Refer to the illustration on pages 4 and 5.] Such a paradise is promised in the Bible.” Read Psalm 72:7. If there is interest, turn to page 175, paragraphs 3 and 4, and point out what we must do if we want to live in the coming Paradise.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Here is a suggestion for following up your placements of the book “Happiness—How to Find It”:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “All of us would like to be happy. Many feel that genuine happiness is an impossibility in this world. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.] It has been said that happiness is a state of mind. If our minds are filled with love for others, respect for God, and a sure hope for the future, we can experience genuine happiness in spite of our problems.” Read Psalm 119: 1, 2. Explain that a study of the Bible teaches us how to love others, show respect for God, । and find a comforting hope for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">* You might follow up a placement of the book “True Peace and Security—How Can You Find It?” with a brief presentation something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ “World leaders today have been unable to bring peace and security. Jehovah God is the only one who can do that. The Bible shows us what we need to do. [Discuss points in paragraphs 1 and 2 on page 175, and then read Isaiah 26:4.] I’d like to show you how this book can help you.&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> You might follow up a placement of the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” with this suggestion:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">■ “Previously I left you a copy of this brochure, which raises a vital question: ‘Does God really care about us?’ After reviewing this brochure, what conclusion did you come to? [Allow for response.] Likely you were encouraged by reading the scriptures that promise a paradise new world, where we can live in peace. [Show the illustrations on pages 2 and 3, and point out some of the appealing features of the new world.] I feel sure that you and your loved ones would like to live in such a world. Notice what paragraph 16 on page 31 says about this.” Read the paragraph, and point out that searching for Jehovah means learning more about him and his purposes by studying his Word, the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah has set a perfect example as a loving Shepherd who cares for his sheep. (Ezek. 34:11-14) Our sincere effort to imitate his loving care pleases him, demonstrates our love, and brings blessings to others.</span></p></li></ul>

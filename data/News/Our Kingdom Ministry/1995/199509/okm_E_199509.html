<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>DISTRICT CONVENTION SOUNDS A STIRRING CALL!</span></h2>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Joyfully Praise Jehovah From Day to Day!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">praised, j (Ps. 96:2, 4j Does this apply only to pioneers? No! Does this mean, that all of us should talk to others</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “If the trumpet sounds an indistinct call, who will get ready for bat-tte?” asked the apostle Paul. (1 Cor. 14:8) Was the call that went out at the “Joyful Praisers&quot; District Convention loud and clear? Yes, indeed. ‘Praise Jehovah joyfully and daily’ was the rousing message! Was your heart stirred by this call to action? The convention program abounded with powerful reasons for our constantly praising the King of eternity, Jehovah.—<sup>:</sup>Ps. 35: 27, 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The awesome heavens declare Jehovah’s glory “one day after another day.” (Ps. 19:1-3) If voiceless, Inanimate creations constantly give praise tb”Je-hovah, should not we intelligent humans feel moved to lift our voices in praise to him at all times for his incomparable qualities and accomplishments? Who is more deserving of our Joyful praise than our magnificent Creator?—Ps. 145:3,7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> From Day to Day: </span><span class="font11">The Inspired psalmist wrote’'’&quot;From day to day tell the </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">good news of salvation</span><span class="font11"> by him. For Jehovah is great and very much to be about Jehovah whenever and wherever we can, even on days we are not engaged in the house-to-house ministry? Yes! The need to praise Jehovah daily and tell others about his means of salvation Is urgent. People must know that Jehovah Is the King Eternal and that He has given world rulership to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">His glorified Son, Jesus Christ. Loye. for Jehovah and for people will keep us talking about this message and about his provisions for salvation wherever people can be found.—Ps. 71:15.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">* Every day of his earthly ministry, Jesus Christ set the finest example as a forthright pralser of Jehovah. He said: “I p</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">^bllclv</span><span class="font11"> praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth.” (Matt. 11:25) True to his word, wherever Jesus was, he publicly praised Jehovah. And wher-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">ever crowds would gather—whether In the synagogues, at the temple In Jerusalem, on a mountaintop, or at the seashore—he praised Jehovah. If we closely follow Jesus’ footsteps by maintaining daily, consistent activity in publicly exalting Jehovah, we will experience Joyful, happy r</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">esults</span><span class="font11">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Answering ths Call: </span><span class="font11">Will you answer the call to praise Jehovah publicly each day? Remember, age is no barrier. Psalm 148:12 Invites young men, virgins, old men, and boys to praise Jehovah. Young ones, will you praise Jehovah among schoolmates and teachers during this new school year? Adults, are those you work with at your place of employment hearing about Jehovah and his purposes, when there is an appropriate occasion to talk together? All of us should make talking about Jehovah as much a part of our life as is breathing and eating. Even if apathetic people do not pay attention to what we say, there is One who does, and he will reward us.—Mal. 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">• As the system’s end draws near, the call goes out to the ends of the earth: “Praise Jah, you people!&quot; (Ps. 106:1) May our shout of praise grow louder with each passing day so that all will know that the One whose name Is Jehovah is the Most High over all the earth.—Ps. 83:18.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Examined by Jehovah—Why Beneficial?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Everyone desires good health. It makes life much more enjoyable. Yet, many who enjoy good health still get a checkup occasionally. Why? They seek to detect any developing health problems so that measures can be taken to remedy them. It is even more important to safeguard our spiritual health. Jehovah’s approval depends on our keeping “healthy In the faith.&quot; —Titus 1:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Now is an appropriate time to be examined by Jehovah. Why so? Because Jehovah is in his holy temple, and he is examining the hearts of all men. (Ps. 11:4,5; Prov. 17:3) Like David, we ask Jehovah to give us a thorough examination: “Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys and my heart.&quot;—Ps. 26:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> We must guard against threats to our spiritual health that may come from within us because of our imperfect flesh. Proverbs 4:23 counsels: “More than all else that is to be guarded, safeguard your heart, for out of It are the sources of life.&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">’Our spiritual health can also be threatened by the corrupt, Immoral world that surrounds us. If we allow ourselves to get too close to this wicked system, we could begin to think as it does and develop worldly attitudes. Or we might adopt a worldly Ufe-style and be overcome by the spirit of the world.—Eph. 2:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">* Satan may use persecution or direct opposition in an effort to devastate us spiritually. Far more often, however, he craftily uses worldly attractions to seduce us. Peter urges us to ‘keep our senses and be watchful,’ since Satan is “like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.&quot; We are urged to ‘take a stand against him, remaining solid in the faith.’—1 Pet. 5: 8, 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> There is a need to protect our spiritual health, keeping our faith strong by strengthening it each day. The apostle Paul recommends that we test our faith continually. Just as we wisely heed practical advice given to us by a competent doctor, we also listen to Jehovah when His spiritual examination reveals a problem that needs to be corrected. This makes it possible for us “to be readjusted.&quot;—2 Cor. 13:5,11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">’Jehovah is truly the great Examiner. His diagnosis is always accurate. He knows exactly what we need. Through his Word and ‘the faithful slave,’ he prescribes a healthful spiritual diet. (Matt. 24:45; 1 Tim. 4:6) Regular feeding on this diet of nutritious spiritual food at home and at congregation meetings enables us to keep spiritually healthy. Regular spiritual exercise in the ministry and other Christian activity is also beneficial. Therefore, we welcome a regular examination by Jehovah, confident that he will keep us in the best of spiritual health.</span></p>

Since the magazines are published in a variety of languages, we should tell foreign-language-speaking persons that the magazines are available in their native language. (The local foreign-language congregation assigned to that territory should be informed.) In frequently worked territory, distributing our magazines can be the most effective means of cultivating interest, since they provide fresh information on a weekly basis. Where interest is found on return visits, offer a subscription. Have a family group demonstrate a practice session, as described in paragraph 14. Also, point out some practical suggestions for increasing placements.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Do All Things for God’s Glory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> How refreshing it is to associate with our dear brothers and sisters! (1 Cor. 16:17, 18) We do this at meetings, at assemblies, at conventions, and in the field ministry. We also fellowship on informal occasions, as when we have guests visit in our home. Doing so, we show hospitality and encourage one another. (Rom. 12:13; 1 Pet. 4:9) When arranging wedding receptions, keep in mind the fine counsel in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> of April 15, 1984.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Organized Social Affaire: </span><span class="font11">Whether we are “eating or drinking or doing anything else,&quot; we should “do afi things for God’s glory.” (1 Cor. 10:31-33) This counsel is not observed by some, and problems continue to develop because of social gatherings too large to be properly supervised. In some instances, hundreds of people are invited to elaborate functions where worldly entertainment is featured. Sometimes those attending are asked to pay admission or other fees. Such gatherings closely resemble worldly affairs, the spirit of which is out of harmony with decency and Bible principles. —Rom. 13:13, 14; Eph. 5:15-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> It has been reported that large numbers of Witnesses have gathered at rented facilities where the entertainment is unwholesome and worldly and where proper supervision is lacking. Similar activities advertised as a “Jehovah’s Witness&quot; weekend have been held at hotels or resorts. Because of the difficulty in properly supervising such large groups, problems have developed. Rowdiness, overindulgence in alcoholic beverages, and even immorality have sometimes resulted. (Eph. 5:3, 4) Social gatherings where such conduct occurs do not honor Jehovah. Rather, they bring reproach upon the good name of the congregation and stumble others.—1 Cor. 10:23, 24. 29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">* Christians are encouraged to show hospitality, but the emphasis should be focused on the spiritual interchange. (Rom. 1:11, 12) Small get-togethers are usually best. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font11"> book says on pages 135-6: “At times, several families may be invited to a home for Christian fellowship. ... Reasonably, those who are hosts in such cases should feel personally responsible for what takes place. With this in mind, discerning Christians have seen the wisdom of limiting the size of such groups and the duration of the gatherings.&quot; Jesus Indicated that nothing elaborate is needed when our goal is to encourage our friends spiritually.—Luke 10: 40-42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>s</sup> It is a fine thing to show hospitality to fellow Christians. However, there is a big difference between a modest gathering in our home and an elaborate affair reflecting a worldly spirit in a rented facility. When you invite others to be your guests, you should be sure that you can assume full responsibility for what takes place.—See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> of August 15,1992, pages 17-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Truly, Jehovah has blessed us with a brotherhood from which we derive refreshing encouragement that motivates us to continue in fine works. (Matt. 5:16; 1 Pet. 2:12) By displaying modesty and reasonableness in social activities, we will always bring glory to our God and be upbuilding to others.—Rom. 15:2.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Make the Best Use of Our Magazines</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When you approach a newsstand, what do you see? </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Magazines.</span><span class="font12"> At a corner store, what catches your eye? </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Magazines.</span><span class="font12"> What makes the mailman bend under the weight of his mailbag? </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Magazines. </span><span class="font12">Thus, what are many people reading? </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Magazines. </span><span class="font12">Surveys have shown that 9 out of 10 youths between the ages of 10 and 18, and the same percentage of adults, read at least one magazine every month. The world is magazine conscious.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Can we make honesthearted persons </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> conscious? Yes, if WE are </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> conscious. What can help us? Consider these suggestions:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">■ Read the Magazines:</span><span class="font12"> One traveling overseer reported that, on the average, only 1 publisher in 3 in his circuit reads each issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> from cover to cover. Do you? As you read each article, ask yourself, ‘Who would appreciate this information—a mother, an agnostic, a businessman, a youth?’ In your personal copy, mark a point or two that you can use when presenting the magazine. Then think of how you might arouse interest in the subject in just one or two sentences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">■ Have a Definite Magazine Order:</span><span class="font12"> Place a realistic order with the brother handling magazines for a definite number of copies of each issue. In this way, you and your family will have a regular and adequate supply of magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">■ Schedule a Regular Magazine Day:</span><span class="font12"> Many congregations have set aside a designated day primarily for magazine witnessing. Can you support the congregation’s Magazine Day? If not, try to use some service time periodically for magazine street witnessing and personal distribution of the magazines, both from door to door and on magazine routes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">■ Be “Watchtower&quot; and “Awake!&quot; Conscious:</span><span class="font12"> Carry copies of the magazines with you when traveling or shopping. Offer them when you talk to coworkers, neighbors, schoolmates, or teachers. One couple who often travel by plane use a point in one of the current magazines to strike up a conversation with the passenger seated next to them. They have enjoyed many delightful experiences. Some young people regularly bring to school articles that they feel will interest their teachers or fellow students. Carry copies with you when you run errands, and offer them to the merchants after you have finished your business. Many of us buy gasoline regularly; why not offer the magazines to the gas station attendant? Keep them handy when relatives visit, when you use public transportation, or when you are waiting for an appointment. Can you think of other appropriate occasions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">■ Prepare a Brief Magazine Presentation:</span><span class="font12"> Plan to say only a little, but say it well. Be enthusiastic. Appeal to the heart. Be specific. Pick out one idea from an article, put it into a few words, and offer the magazines. The best presentation raises a question on a subject of interest and then points to an article that gives the Scriptural answer. Consider a few examples of how this might be done:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you are highlighting an article on the rising crime rate, you could ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ “What will it take to make it possible for us to be able to sleep at night without fear of crime?” The householder may be pessimistic about things getting better. You can reply that many people feel the same way and add that you have some information you believe will be of interest to him. Then refer to an appropriate point in the article.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> When offering an article on family life, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Many people find that it is a real challenge to earn a living and raise a family these days. A number of books have been written on the subject, but even the experts don’t agree on the solutions to our problems. Is there anywhere we can go to obtain reliable guidance?” Then point to a specific comment in the magazine that demonstrates the wisdom found in the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> You might take this approach when featuring an article on a social problem:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Most people are under pressure today. God never intended for us to live this way.” Then show how the Bible-based material in the article can help us cope with life’s problems now and provide hope for a permanent solution in the future.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> What about donations? To make appreciative ones aware of how they can assist, you could say: “Although our literature is offered without charge, we do accept modest donations for our worldwide work.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Street Witnessing Is Effective: </span><span class="font12">It was in the January 1940 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Informant (Our Kingdom Ministry)</span><span class="font12"> that publishers were encouraged for the first time to schedule a special day each week for street witnessing using the magazines. Do you engage in street witnessing from time to time? If you do, is the method you use truly effective? Some publishers have been observed standing on a busy street comer, talking to one another while scores of people passed by unnoticed. Rather than stand side by side with the magazines, it is more effective to separate and approach people. Strangers may stop and listen briefly if they are approached by only one person, but few will take the initiative to approach a group engrossed in conversation. Since we attract a lot of attention on the street, there is a special need to be well-groomed and modestly dressed as befits God’s ministers. —1 Tim. 2:9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Magazine Routes: </span><span class="font12">Those who have a magazine route place many magazines even though the territories are being covered regularly. Magazine routes are an excellent source of potential home Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> When you make regular return visits to deliver the magazines, you will find that the warmth and friendliness between you and the householder will grow. The better you become acquainted, the easier it will be to converse about Scriptural topics. This can lead to starting a productive home Bible study. At calls where there is obvious appreciation for the magazines, offer a subscription. And remember, each time you contact the householder you can report a return visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> One sister regularly took magazines to a woman who always accepted them but said: “I don’t believe what you’re telling me.” On a later visit, the sister found the husband at home. After a friendly talk, arrangements were made to start a Bible study. The sister made friends with the three sons who came to join in the study. Eventually, the mother and her sons dedicated their lives to Jehovah and were baptized. To date, 35 members of the family have accepted the truth. All of this because the sister followed up on her magazine route!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> There are many ways to start a magazine route. You can start a route by simply keeping a record of your placements and arranging to return every two weeks with the latest issues. One way is to use information under the heading “In Our Next Issue.” When you return, tell the householder that you have the article you mentioned previously. Or, when making the return visit, you could say: “When I read this article, I thought it might interest you . . .” Then make a few brief comments on the article and offer it. When you have completed the call, note five simple points on your house-to-house record: (1) householder’s name, (2) householder’s address, (3) date of visit, (4) issues placed, and (5) article featured. Some publishers have been very successful in developing magazine routes, accumulating as many as 40 or more calls on their list!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Business Territory: </span><span class="font12">Many magazines are placed by publishers who work business territory. Have you tried the store-to-store work? Reports indicate that in some congregations, participation in this feature of service is quite limited. At first, some are apprehensive about calling on businesspeople, but after they try it a few times, they find it both interesting and rewarding. Why not ask an experienced publisher or pioneer to help you get started?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>13</sup> There are several advantages to working from store to store. There are very few not-at-homes, at least during business hours! Businesspeople are usually courteous, even if they may not be particularly interested in the Bible. Get an early start; you will likely be better received. After introducing yourself, you might say that you rarely find businesspeople at home, so you are visiting them for just a few moments at their workplace to offer the latest issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">Point out that many businesspeople appreciate our magazines because they need to keep up-to-date on world events but have little time to read. The magazines present thought-provoking information from a fresh perspective, without religious, political, or commercial bias. A magazine route may be developed with interested persons found in business territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> Prepare as a Family: </span><span class="font12">Some time may be set aside during your family study to discuss which articles in the latest magazines might be appropriate for use in your territory. Family members —including the children—can take turns practicing their presentations and overcoming common objections that are raised, such as: “I’m busy,” “We have our own religion,” or “I’m not interested.” Good cooperation can make it possible for the whole family to have a regular share in magazine distribution.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>IS</sup> Book Study Conductors Can Help: </span><span class="font12">Whenever practical, schedule the meetings for service on Magazine Day at the book study locations instead of having the entire congregation meet at the Kingdom Hall. Those in charge of meetings for field service should be well prepared with specific suggestions for the group. These may include a sample presentation and a point or two from the current issues that might be used to arouse interest locally. Meetings for field service—including the organizing of the group—should be brief, lasting no more than from 10 to 15 minutes. Study conductors should make sure that there is sufficient territory so that the group will be kept busy for the entire field service period.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> Show Appreciation for the Magazines: </span><span class="font12">The article “Making Good Use of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!”</span><span class="font12"> that was published in the July 1993 issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> made this important point: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> do not lose their value, even if they have not all been placed within a month or two of their issue date. The information they contain does not become less important with the passage of time ... Allowing older magazines to accumulate and never using them shows a lack of appreciation for these valuable instruments. ... Instead of setting aside older issues and forgetting about them, would it not be better to make a special effort to place them in the hands of interested people?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>17</sup> Today there are many honesthearted people who are searching for the truth. The information contained in one magazine could be just what they need to lead them to the truth! Jehovah has given us a thrilling message to proclaim, and our magazines play a vital role in getting the message to others. Will you be more conscious of magazine distribution in the future? Will you apply some of these suggestions this very weekend? You will be richly blessed if you do.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Practical Suggestions:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Read the magazines in advance, and get acquainted with the articles.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Select an article that deals with something of general interest in your community.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ Prepare a presentation that will be appropriate for a variety of people, whether men, women, or youths. Show how the magazine relates to the householder and how the whole family will enjoy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Plan to engage in your field service activity when most people are at home. Some congregations arrange for evening witnessing with the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Keep your presentation short and to the point. ■ Don’t talk too fast. If your listener has no interest, talking faster will not help. Try to be relaxed, and give the householder opportunity to respond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Offering Magazines From House to House:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Have a friendly smile and a kindly tone of voice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Be enthusiastic about the magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Speak slowly and distinctly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Speak on only one subject; briefly stimulate interest, and show its value to householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Highlight just one article.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Feature only one magazine, offering the other as a companion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Hand the magazines to the householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">■ Let the householder know you plan to return.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ Have a friendly, positive conclusion if the magazines are refused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Make notation on house-to-house record of all interest and placements.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Maintaining a Balanced View of Computer Technology</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul urged Christians in the first century not to be distracted, because “the time left is reduced.” (1 Cor. 7:29) As the end of this old system of things nears, how urgent it is for us to ‘seek </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font12"> the Kingdom and God’s righteousness’ and to ‘buy out the opportune time’! Time is precious.—Matt. 6:33; Eph. 5:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Technology has been hailed as a great saver of time. For example, at the click of a computer button, a user can instantly access huge amounts of information. Computers can often do in seconds what would have taken hours or weeks to do by other means. When properly used, they are a helpful tool.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Will It </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Really</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Save Time?: </span><span class="font12">On the other hand, such technology does not come to the user without substantial costs—both in money and in time. Hours may be required to learn how to make the computer do some tasks. Moreover, a person who becomes intrigued with the technology itself may consume time that could be better spent. We must keep a balanced view, having in mind the principle involved in the apostle Paul’s admonition to walk “as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves.”—See 1 Corinthians 7:31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> A number of well-intentioned individuals have designed computer programs for keeping congregation records. It is, of course, a personal decision as to how an individual uses his computer. However, congregation records for which forms have been provided should not be kept on computers, since children or other unauthorized persons could access them. All congregation records—accounts records, Congregation’s Publisher Record cards, and so forth—should be kept on the forms provided by the Society, and the information on these congregation forms should not be stored in a computer. In this way, the confidential records of the congregation will be protected.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Responsible overseers should be discerning in making assignments for the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting program. They need to have in mind the material to be covered in a particular part. In the school, for example, some material may not be appropriate for just any student to handle. The purpose of the presentation as well as the qualifications of the individual and the nature of the material should be considered. It should not be left to the computer to decide.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> A brother who is assigned a part to be presented at congregation meetings should not rely on material prepared by someone else, particularly an unknown Individual, just because it has been made available on a computer network and using it will save him work. Responsible Christians do not presume to prepare Bible talks or meeting parts and make them available on computer networks for others to use. However, the computer and the Society’s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Library</span><span class="font12"> on CD-ROM may be valuable tools in the hands of the individual brother, contributing to effective research in the limited time available.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> As for reproducing and distributing computer programs, lists, and related documentation among the brothers, and preparing and distributing parts on the Service Meeting and Theocratic Ministry School by electronic or other means, it is usually better for brothers to prepare their own material, with local benefits in mind. (1 Tim. 4:13,15) On no account should congregational connections ever be exploited for making financial gain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> What about the distribution of computer printouts of scriptures used in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> Study or in the Congregation Book Study? Well, it may be preferable for publishers to make their individual notes and markings right in the Bible and the publications being studied. At the meeting, use of computer printouts of Scripture texts that are cited in the publications could discourage use of the Bible itself in finding scriptures. Yet looking up Scripture texts during a Bible study or at a congregation meeting is part of the training received, equipping us for effective use of the Bible in the field ministry. In most instances, and especially with longer quotations, reading directly from the Bible is more effective, particularly when the audience is encouraged to follow along in the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> Other Serious Pitfalls: </span><span class="font12">As outlined on page 17 of the August 1,1993, issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> connecting a computer to an electronic bulletin board can open the way to serious spiritual dangers. Just as an unscrupulous individual can place on a bulletin board a virus—a program designed to corrupt and destroy computer files—apostates, clergymen, and persons seeking to corrupt others morally or otherwise can freely place their poisonous ideas on bulletin boards. Unless a bulletin board, even one labeled “JW Only,” is properly supervised, with its use being limited to those who are mature, faithful servants of Jehovah, it could expose Christian users to “bad associations.” (1 Cor. 15:33) The Society has received reports that such so-called private networks have been used not only to speculate regarding spiritual matters but also to give bad advice, spread gossip and false information, plant negative ideas, raise questions and doubts that subvert the faith of some, and disseminate private interpretations of Scripture. On the surface, some information may appear to be interesting and informative, and yet it may be laced with poisonous elements. Christians look to “the faithful and discreet slave” for timely spiritual food and for clarifications. (See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> of July 1, 1994, pages 9-11.) A Christian has the serious responsibility to safeguard his faith against all corrupting influences and, basic to that, should always know with whom he is associating.—Matt. 24:45-47; 2 John 10,11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> The same </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> article emphasized the importance of respecting copyright laws. Most companies that prepare and sell computer programs copyright these, and they provide a license outlining how the programs can legally be used. The license usually says that the owner cannot give to others copies of the program; in fact, international copyright law makes it illegal to do so. Many greedy people have no scruples about breaking the law. Christians, though, should be conscientious in legal matters, rendering to Caesar what belongs to Caesar.—Matt. 22:21; Rom. 13:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> Some large firms sell computers containing preinstalled and licensed programs. However, certain computer stores do not provide licenses because the programs they preinstall are illegal copies, meaning that the purchaser violates the law in using the programs. Related to this, Christians should avoid putting onto, or downloading from, electronic bulletin boards material that is copyrighted (as are the Society’s publications) and that is being copied without legal permission from the owners.—Heb. 13:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> The value of any application of technology must be weighed against the potential dangers inherent in its use. Just as television can be used to good advantage, the unwholesome effect it is having on mankind today has caused even worldly sources to express serious concern. Computer networks extend worldwide and can bring unlimited valuable information into the home or workplace. They offer much-needed services to businesses and organizations as well as to individuals who need to keep pace with personal or business interests in the fast-moving society in which we live. At the same time, computer networks are plagued with problems such as pornography, divisive hate propaganda, and detailed Information on how to perform vile and wicked deeds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>13</sup> There are many important reasons, therefore, why a Christian must maintain a balanced view of computer technology. Many individuals are enjoying the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation, Insight</span><span class="font12"> volumes, and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Get-Verse</span><span class="font12"> program, which the Society has made available on computer diskettes. Others have been benefited by using the Society issued </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Library</span><span class="font12"> on CD-ROM, which incorporates additional research capabilities. While recognizing the value of certain technology, a person who uses such modem technology for beneficial purposes should also be on guard to protect himself and others from any negative aspects. We need to exercise balance so that even the harmless use of technology does not consume an inordinate amount of our dedicated time or distract us from our primary work and goals—Matt. 6:22; 28: 19,20.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">■ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make an announcement to the congregation when this has been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Publishers planning to serve as auxiliary pioneers in October should tum in their application early. This will allow the elders to make necessary arrangements for literature and territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on pages 21-3 of the April 15, 1991, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated persons who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ A new </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Publications List </span><span class="font11">has been prepared, and four copies are being sent to each congregation.

<p><span class="font11">■ The Society receives many inquiries from publishers and others interested in financially advancing theocratic activities. In response to these inquiries, a magazine-size brochure entitled </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Planned Giving to Benefit Kingdom Service Worldwide</span><span class="font11"> has been prepared. The brochure contains Information on gifts, wills, and trusts, as well as information</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">regarding estate, financial, and tax planning. It is designed to help those desiring to benefit Kingdom service worldwide to select the best way to do so, given their family and personal circumstances. By reading the brochure and conferring with those working with the Society's Planned Giving Desk, many have been able to assist the Society and at the same time maximize the tax benefits of doing so. The elders have a brochure available for inspection, or a personal copy may be obtained by writing or calling the Watch Tower Society, Planned Giving Desk, 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204, telephone (914) 878-7000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What Goals Have You Set for Your Children?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Success in life depends on setting and achieving worthwhile goals. Those who pursue trivial or unrealistic goals end up disappointed and unfulfilled. It takes wisdom to discern which objectives to pursue in order to “get a firm hold on the real life.” (1 Tim. 6:19) How thankful we are that Jehovah, through his Word and organization, shows us exactly which way to go!—Isa. 30:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In providing such loving guidance, Jehovah sets a fine example for parents. Instead of leaving it up to their inexperienced children to choose which way is best, wise parents train them in the way that they should go, and when they grow old, they “will not tum aside from it.&quot; (Prov. 22:6) Christian parents know from experience that they cannot trust their own judgment; they must rely on Jehovah. (Prov. 3:5, 6) This need is even greater for children, who are limited in knowledge and experience.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Parents can set before their children worthwhile goals that will help them focus on “the more Important things.” (Phil. 1:10) They can start with the family study, encouraging the children to appreciate its importance and to learn from it. It is good for children to acquire the habit of studying in advance for congregation meetings and preparing to offer comments in their own words. A regular share in the preaching work is important. Young children can contribute by offering tracts, reading scriptures, or presenting magazines. When they are able to read, enrollment in the Theocratic Ministry School can accelerate their spiritual progress. Qualifying as an unbaptized publisher or being accepted for baptism is a mEyor step forward.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">* As their children approach the teenage years, or even earlier, parents should realistically talk to them about career goals. School counselors and classmates can easily influence them in favor of worldly, materialistic pursuits. Parents should assist their children to choose school courses that provide practical training, equipping them to care for their material needs without sacrificing Kingdom Interests. (1 Tim. 6:6-10) They can be encouraged to pursue the “gift” of singleness, and then later, if they decide to marry, they will be in a position to assume the heavy responsibilities of marriage. (Matt. 19:10, 11; 1 Cor. 7:36-38) By speaking in a positive way about pioneering, serving where the need is greater, Bethel service, or missionary activity, parents can instill in children even at an early age a desire to use their lives in a way that pleases Jehovah, benefits others, and brings blessings to themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> It is not by accident that we have so many young people in the organization today who hold to high Christian values and pursue theocratic goals. Much of their success can be attributed to loving parents. If you are a parent, where do your children seem to be headed? Are they moving ahead progressively toward a life focused on Kingdom interests? Remember, one of the most important things you can do is to inculcate the truth in your children, and speak of it every day. You may be blessed with a household that is faithful in serving Jehovah.—Deut. 6:6, 7; Josh. 24:15.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Others to Benefit Themselves</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah promises to teach us what we need to know. He assures us at Psalm 32:8: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go. I will give advice with my eye upon you.” This assurance is of great benefit to us. Unselfishly, we want to show others how they can benefit themselves by heeding the wise counsel from the Bible. (Isa. 48:17) During September we can do this by offering the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font11"> book. In making our presentations, there are various ways we can show the practical value of the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> In view of the prevalence of marriage problems today, you might choose to feature this thought from the “Live Forever&quot; book:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Most of the people I have spoken to are very concerned about the tremendous increase In marital unhappiness and divorce. How do you feel about this problem? [Allow for response.] Many have failed to realize the underlying causes. If they make a sincere effort, not only can couples save their marriage but they can find genuine happiness as well. The key to success lies in applying counsel found in the Bible.&quot; Read Ephesians 5:28, 29, 33. Turn to page 243, discuss paragraphs 16 and 17, and then offer the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">’ Children need quality time and training from their parents. In featuring the &quot;Live Forever” book, you could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ “All of us are concerned about the future well-being of our young people. In your opinion, what is the best way that parents can help their children find a secure future? [Allow for response.] Listen to this advice from a Bible proverb written about 3,000 years ago. [Read Proverbs 22:6.] While our children can benefit a great deal from instruction they receive in school, their most valuable training is provided at home by their parents. It requires time, attention, and love, but it is well worth the effort.&quot; Turn to page 245, discuss paragraphs 20 and 21, and then explain how the book can be used as a basis for family study of the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> You may wish to offer the &quot;Live Forever” book by showing how the earth will become a paradise:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “I’m sure you are concerned about what your life will be like in the future. In the Lord's Prayer, Jesus taught us to pray for God’s will to be done on the earth as it is in heaven. What will the earth be like when that takes place? [Allow for response.] Here is an artist's portrayal of a paradise world. [Point out the illustration on pages 12 and 13. Then read Isaiah 11:6-9, included in paragraph 12.] Wouldn't it be wonderful to live in such a world? This book will show you how you and your family can live in a paradise like this.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Preparing your presentation in advance is a key factor in determining your success at the door. Before you knock, make sure you have something specific to say about a Scriptural thought. Also, have in mind a brief comment about an interesting feature of the magazine or tract you plan to offer if the book is not accepted. Take advantage of every opportunity you have to sow the seeds of Kingdom truth during September. (Eccl. 11:6) You will be helping others to reap benefits that will last forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow Up All Interest to Benefit Others</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> What is the key factor that helps us determine whether or’not we should leave our literature with someone? Interest! The same is true when it comes to making return visits. Whenever someone shows even a little Interest in the Kingdom message, we want to do whatever we can to benefit that person. So we make return visits with the objective of cultivating the person’s Interest and starting a home Bible study. This is our goal even when we do not leave literature. How can this be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> If your previous conversation was about the prevalence of marriage problems today and you left the “Live Forever” book, you could open your conversation this way: </span><span class="font11">■ “On my previous visit, we talked about marriage and practical Bible counsel that can help us find greater happiness. Isn’t it true that even in the best of families, problems arise from time to time? [Allow for response.] The Bible gives us excellent counsel that can help us resolve problems in family relationships. A family can be blessed by studying the Bible together.” Turn to page 246, and discuss paragraph 23. Read John 17:3, and offer your assistance in helping the family to begin studying the Bible in the home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> If you spoke about children and their need for training, you might continue the discussion in this manner:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Previously we spoke about the spiritual training that children need and how parents can help them. Most parents I have spoken to are alarmed about the bad conduct of so many young people today. What do you think about . . . ? [Mention an example of youthful misconduct often observed in your community. Allow for response.] Let me show you some of the practical advice given in the Bible.&quot; Turn to paragraph 22 on page 246 in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font11"> book, discuss the main point, and read Ephesians 6:4. Point out that most children actually want discipline and guidance. When parents are diligent in providing it, the children are happier and more respectful in their conduct. Explain how we study the Bible with our children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">’ If the subject of your conversation was the Paradise earth, then you might say this to rekindle the interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ “We looked at some illustrations in this book that showed us what the earth will be like when God makes it into a paradise. It would mean little to us if we could not enjoy it with our loved ones. Wouldn’t you agree?&quot; Allow for response. Then turn to page 162 in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font11"> book. Read Revelation 21:3,4, and explain how our loved ones can always be with us. If there is good response, read John 5:28, 29 to show that the dead will return to life. Point to the cover of the book and say: “It’s really true—we can live forever in Paradise on earth!&quot; Arrange for another visit to discuss why we know it is near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The main purpose of a return visit is to help Interested persons benefit from the Kingdom message. Most people need a stimulus to whet their appetite for spiritual things. Direct their attention to specific points of practical value in the literature, stressing how it can help them to understand the Bible better. Return visits that accomplish these goals will help others to benefit themselves in the best way possible.</span></p>

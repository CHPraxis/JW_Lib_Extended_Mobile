<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Preaching—An Honored Privilege J</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1">For United States of America fa <sub>T</sub>w &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. 38, No. 2</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The ministry of the good news is an honored privilege that Jehovah has extended to us. (Rom. 15:16; </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">1 Tim. </span><span class="font12">1:12) Is that the way you view it? Nei-tfier the passage of time nor the ridicule of others should be allowed to diminish its importance in our eyes. Bearing God’s name is an honor given only to a few. How can we make our appreciation for this privilege grow?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Preaching the Kingdom message does not bring us the world’s favor. Many view our work with apathy or indifference. Others ridicule and oppose it. Such opposition can come from workmates, neighbors, or even family members. In their eyes we may appear to be misguided and foolish. (J</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ohn 15; 19;</span><span class="font12"> 1 Cor. 1:18, 21; 2 Tim. 3:125 Their discouraging comments are designed to dampen our zeal and cause us to slow down or to relinquish our honored privilege. Negative views are promoted by Satan, who &quot;has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">. . . might not shine through.&quot; (2 Cor. 4:4) How do you react?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> It is important to keep in mind that our preaching about the Kingdom is the most important work any of us could be doing today. We have a lifesaving message that is available through no other means. (Rom. 10: 13-15) Having God's approval, not that of man, is what counts. The world’s negative view of our preaching activity does not deter us from boldly declaring the good news.—Acts 4:29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’ Jesus highly esteemed his privilege to do his Father’s will. JJ^hn 4:34) He devoted himself exclusively to the ministry and did not allow either distractions or opposers to slow him down. Preaching the Kingdom message always took first place in his life. (Luke 4:43) We are commanded to im-itatnnSTXafnple. (1 Pet. 2:21) In doing so, we serve as “God’s fellow workers.” (1 Cor. 3:9) Are we taking full advantage of this privilege? Do we seek occasions to share the good news with others both formally and informally? </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">•[ As</span><span class="font12"> Witnesses of Jehovah, we should always be ready to “make public declaration to his name.”—Heb. 13:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Our share in the ministry is largely determined by our attitude. Do we deeply appreciate all that Jehovah has done for us? Have we developed in our hearts a love for Jehovah that motivates us to do all we can in his service? Meditating on the blessings we now enjoy as well as what Jehovah has promised for the future helps us to abound in love for our Creator. Such love motivates us to action—persistence and regularity in the Kingdompreaching work to the extent our circumstances allow. Our zeal will give evidence of our love for Jehovah and our neighbor.—Mark 12:30, 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> We show how highly we value something by what we do with it and say about it. Do we truly value our privilege to preach about the Kingdom? Do we glorify our ministry? Are we determined to persevere in this vital work in spite of opposition? If we highly esteem this wonderful privilege, we will surely be zealous and wholehearted.—2 Cor. 4:1, 7.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Word of the Kingdom —Getting the Sense of It</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In his illustration of the sower, Jesus said that the seed falling on “the fine soil&quot; pictured “the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it.” (Matt. 13:23) After hearing about the Kingdom, have we got “the sense of it”? How much does it influence our lives? Have we put Kingdom interests in first place, thus revealing that we did get the sense of the message?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> A correct understanding of the Kingdom message requires personal study. We need to take time to meditate on the spiritual food provided. Hasty reading of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">is like gulping down a tasty and nutritious meal. Do you take time to give the spiritual food thorough consideration? To gain the most benefit, there must be an incentive and a healthy spiritual appetite. If these are lacking, other activities can minimize the benefits of personal study or consume the time we need for it. Sticking to a good study schedule is not easy. While it takes a careful balancing of priorities, the spiritual riches to be gained are priceless.—Prov. 3: 13-18; Col: 1:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Examining the Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> helps us each day to entertain positive, upbuilding thoughts about the Kingdom. Those Who are “conscious of their spiritual need” plan to take a few minutes every day to read the text and comments. (Matt. 5:3) Many texts explain various facets of the Kingdom. For example, on November 22, 1994, the text featured was Matthew 13:4. The comment considered the Kingdom hope and reminded us of the dangers of unwholesome association with relatives and neighbors. The fact that at Bethel homes around the world, there is a 15-minute discussion of the daily text each workday morning emphasizes the benefits and the seriousness of considering the day’s text together. Does your family include a similar consideration in your daily routine?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> As you grow in appreciation for the Kingdom, there will be a greater incentive to share the Kingdom message with others. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> provide what might be likened to mental fuel that feeds our minds with fresh, up-to-date information. They help us to maintain a keen awareness of how much the world needs God's Kingdom. They help us to be spiritual persons, who “have the mind of Christ.&quot; (1 Cor. 2:15, 16) All of this can strengthen our hope and increase our zeal to share the Kingdom hope with others. —1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> It is vital that we personally get the sense of the Kingdom message. The Kingdom is the means that God will use to uphold his sovereignty, end wickedness, and bring a new world—a paradise. Jesus commanded us to put it first in our lives. We must be sheeplike subjects to live under its rule. (Matt. 6:10, 33) Make the most of your opportunity to enjoy its blessings.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The modem history of Jehovah's Witnesses is accurately described in the words of Proverbs 4:18: “The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> In line with this, the Christian congregation continues to receive timely clarification of and updated information on Bible teachings. (Matt. 24:45-47) Likely you can relate examples of this that you have noted since you began to associate with Jehovah's Witnesses. Congregation meetings, including public talks, help us to keep abreast of the increasing light of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Revised Outlines: </span><span class="font12">Recently, the Society has updated a number of public talk outlines. Fresh material has been incorporated into them, and Important points have been clarified. If the congregation is to receive the full benefit of this updated information, brothers who give public talks should use only the very latest outlines.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> With a view to getting the most out of public talks, give some thought to the titles of the talks to be given. Before you attend the Public Meeting, try to recall the latest information from theocratic sources on the subject. Then, while lis</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Public Talks Should Inform and Also Motivate Listeners: </span><span class="font12">When Jesus spoke, he reached the hearts of his listeners. At the conclusion of Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, the most famous public talk ever given, as Matthew 7:28 reports: “The effect was that the crowds were astounded at his way of teaching.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Having Jesus’ example in mind, bodies of elders should use discretion in approving new public speakers, assigning only those brothers who are fine teachers, who will adhere closely to the Society’s outlines, and who are able to hold the attention of the audience. Brothers who are assigned the privilege of giving public talks should continually strive to improve their speaking ability, accepting any counsel and suggestions received from the elders.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’ As foretold at Isaiah 65:13,14, the spiritual prosperity of God’s people continues to become more evident. The arrangement for public talks is one of the many ways that we are “taught by Jehovah.&quot;—Isa. 54:13.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1995 District Convention Simplification</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> How thrilling it is to be present at spiritual feasts, whether at congregation meetings, circuit assemblies, special assembly days, or district conventions! Why? Fellowship with God-fearing persons is refreshing, and the spiritual matters presented on such occasions remind us of the more important things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Increasing thousands have been drawn to such spiritual gatherings in recent years. Between the years 1985 and 1994, the number of congregations worldwide increased over 50 percent, from 49,716 to 75,573. As Jehovah speeds up the ingathering work, the number of district conventions and circuit assemblies increases accordingly. (Isa. 60:22) Even the increase in the number of conventions held just in the United States branch territory, from 113 in 1985 to 168 in 1994, is a reflection of this tremendous growth in the number of congregations. The resulting work involved in arranging for and handling these conventions has been escalating. Since we assemble to benefit from the spiritual program prepared for these feasts, it is wise to simplify as far as is practical in caring for the physical arrangements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Further Steps to Be Taken: </span><span class="font3">We look to Jehovah for his blessing as we move forward progressively. We are happy to see that he has given his people the needed spirit of wisdom and understanding. We must agree that through the faithful slave class, Jesus Christ has directed matters efficiently for the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose in a marvel- ' ous way. (Matt. 24:45-47; Col. 1:9, 10) An announcement in the December </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font3"> stated: “Beginning with the 1995 district conventions and the September 1995 circuit assemblies and special assembly days, there will be no food served. Each one is to bring his own food and drink.” Circuit assemblies and special assembly days will continue with their present simplified food service arrangements through August 1995.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">There has been a positive response to this announcement. You may be interested in knowing how this change will be of benefit. Perhaps the following review of adjustments that have been made in recent years will prove to be a good reminder of the benefits we have already received by simplifying the work at conventions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Previous Adjustments to Simplify: </span><span class="font3">Prior to the implementation of standardized and simplified district convention arrangements, such as food service, volunteer service, and rooming, much work was required on the part of thousands of local brothers and sisters in preconvention work. In view of the pressures and demands made on our brothers by daily living and the continued growth of the organization, adjustments to simplify the work were indeed necessary. Additionally, as a result of simplifying our food service operation in the United States in 1978, over 70,000 brothers and sisters who used to work hard during the sessions to provide us with food were able to listen to the program. In 1987 further simplification procedures were implemented with regard to food service at conventions and during the following service year at Assembly Halls. Later, food items were made available at conventions and assemblies at no charge to those attending. What fine adjustments these were, making the work lighter and allowing more attention to be given to the spiritual aspects of the convention, with the workers being able to listen and enjoy more of the program. (Deut. 31:12) Those faithful ones among us with many years of loyal service well remember these advancements and have expressed appreciation for the direction received. But what work could further be eliminated to make it possible for even more to benefit fully from the spiritual program?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Anticipated Changes: </span><span class="font3">During the years that a simplified menu was prepared and served, it was seen that relatively “few</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">things” were truly “needed.” (Compare Luke 10:38-42.) However, multiplying such few things times the number attending still represented a great volume of supplies and work, as well as added expensive equipment. Then, too, a very large number of volunteers were needed to organize and support the arrangements. Food storage and distribution centers had to be provided. Additionally, some municipal health departments have been extreme in their requirements for serving food, and this has been a burden to the brothers in charge. The Society’s refrigerated trailers have had to be loaded with consignments of food, transported many miles, and unloaded. All of this has involved liabilities of great concern to the Society. The trailers have also required maintenance, storage, and routing that involve work, time, and expense. With further simplification, there will be no need to have refrigerated trailers for convention use or tractors to move these trailers. Furthermore, many brothers will be relieved of the large task of maintaining this equipment.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> The willing service of those who have served as volunteers in these related areas has been of inestimable value and very much appreciated. However, with this further simplification, those thousands serving in the field doing maintenance and driving trucks as well as purchasing, preparing, expediting, and serving the food will be able to use their time in other necessary Kingdom pursuits, including enjoying fellowship at the conventions more fully. Those volunteers who used to serve in Food Service will now be able to assist in other departments, such as Attendants and Cleaning. This will lighten the load for everyone and will not require that many work late at night, early in the morning, or during the sessions, as was the case with a number in Food Service.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Supporting the Arrangements: </span><span class="font3">The Society appreciates very much the fine support you brothers and sisters have given “with a complete heart” over the years to the convention arrangements, including food service. (1 Chron. 29:9) This has helped in many ways. It has made it possible to rent good buildings and care for the convention expenses. It has also enabled those attending to remain at the convention site during the short noon break so as to obtain food conveniently, be refreshed, and then be present for the spiritual program. And no doubt the generosity and support that has been shown by the brothers and sisters in contributing for these provisions will continue. It has been an expression of their appreciation in a practical way.—Prov. 11:25; Luke 16:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Caring for Your Food Needs: </span><span class="font3">With these further adjustments, however, it will be necessary for individuals and family groups to provide just for themselves what is needed in the way of material sustenance during our noon break. We highly esteem the fine benefits of the spiritual program. To let physical food assume undue importance would be unwise. It is vital that each one “make sure of the more important things” in this regard. (Phil. 1:9, 10a) Recent large conventions of Jehovah’s people in Poland, Russia, and Ukraine, as well as in other places, have been held with fine success without food service arrangements. Additionally, some circuits in this country have held their assemblies and special assembly day programs without food service because of local circumstances. In each case the delegates brought their own food for lunch. We will find that if we bring just a light noon snack, it will contribute to our having an alert mental state, enabling us to derive full benefit from the afternoon program. In harmony with this, everyone should bring food that is simple and nourishing. For example, when Jesus fed the crowds, he provided just two items, bread and fish. (Matt. 14:16-20; see also Luke 10:42a.) To that end, we are pleased to offer some suggestions as to what might be appropriate and practical in view of the shortened noon break and the type of facilities we use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> Since there will no longer be food service arrangements at the convention, with good planning those attending will be able to enjoy breakfast with their family either at home or at a local eating place. By getting sufficient rest the night before, you should be able to rise early enough to obtain what is necessary for morning nourishment and arrive at the convention in plenty of time to enjoy fellowship with other delegates. Another benefit of the new arrangement is that the doors to the facilities will not need to be staffed and opened as early as when food service volunteers were admitted along with their families. The doors to the buildings will open at 8:00 a.m. for all delegates, with the exception of those few with specific work assignments that make it necessary for them to enter earlier. As previously, there will be no need for any to rush to the convention site looking for seats, for there has been adequate seating planned for the estimated crowd.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The noon break will be somewhat shorter than at previous conventions. However, it will still provide an opportunity to take in some light nourishment, as well as time for. some association with others. Our brothers and sisters who live in the convention city or nearby and who daily return home in the evening will readily be able to prepare a small amount of food for each member of the family to bring for the day’s noon break. This would be much the same as the lunch youths take to school, perhaps a sandwich and a piece of fruit, a cookie, and something to drink. Many people take similar lunches to their secular jobs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> This will no doubt present more of a challenge for those attending from localities outside the convention city, as some advance planning for their noon food items will be necessary. Perhaps such items as napkins and disposable paper cups for those traveling in your group could be brought from home. Some may find that a light snack of some fresh fruit or vegetables would be enough to satisfy their needs, and this could be brought from home as well. Other food needs for each day’s noon break may be obtained at a grocery store in the convention city. Of course, we realize that refrigeration of an extended menu will not be possible for those staying in hotels.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> As a reminder, please DO NOT COOK IN hotel ROOMS unless they have a kitchenette for that purpose. It is dangerous and illegal to do so and can damage room furnishings with stains and grease. It produces odors that are hard to remove from the room for days. All of this makes it difficult for the hotel to rent the room again without the expense and work of cleaning and deodorizing it. That is why it may be wise to consider purchasing nonperishable items, such as nuts, dried fruit, and crackers, or you may choose to bring along baked items, such as bread, rolls, or muffins. If a lunch item, such as a sandwich, is desired, perhaps the food store you locate may have a delicatessen section where these items are prepared. Purchasing this type of item already made would eliminate food preparation in hotel rooms or vehicles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Inasmuch as the convention site actually becomes a large Kingdom Hall during the convention, it is also wise to avoid developing a picnic atmosphere during the noon break. And just as we do not eat during meetings at the Kingdom Hall, neither would we be eating or drinking during convention sessions. Large family-size picnic coolers will not be permitted in the facility where the convention is held. They could create hazards and cannot be left in aisles or placed on seats. Perhaps reusable tote bags or disposable paper sacks would be better suited to the light snack items that will be needed for our noon break. If necessary, a small cooler that can be placed under, not on, a seat might be used.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Caution also needs to be exercised with regard to the types of drink containers we choose to bring to the convention site. Hot drinks may be brought in thermoses. Glass containers of any kind can prove to be a hazard. Many facilities even prohibit their use. We request, therefore, that NO GLASS containers be brought on the premises. If your selected cold beverage cannot be purchased in a plastic or aluminum container, it would be best to pour it into another type of small nonbreakable container that would fit under your seat.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> Additional Benefits: </span><span class="font3">Truly we can see the wisdom of such adjusted arrangements. All will be able to give full attention to the receiving of spiritual benefits—the real purpose of our assembling. These benefits are provided in the association we enjoy as well as the program itself. So instead of leaving the facility at the noon break to seek food, how beneficial it will prove to be to bring something with us. This will make it possible to enjoy the fellowship of our brothers and sisters and will prevent us from missing any of the afternoon program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> Being spiritually refreshed following the afternoon program, some might enjoy continuing Christian fellowship and conversation about the good things learned while taking in a more substantial meal with family and friends in local eating establishments. Others may just pick up something in a grocery store or a delicatessen. Those who are able to return to their own home may choose to have an evening meal there, much as they do other days that they spend in secular work or field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> We truly enjoy the spiritual banquet at these assemblies and conventions, where we receive new publications, fine teaching, and practical counsel. These blessings are what everyone remembers, along with the joy of being with God’s assembled people. Proverbs 10:22 says: “The blessing of Jehovah —that is what makes rich, and he adds no pain with it.” This is because as Jehovah’s people, we do not attend conventions with material wants and comforts in view. We assemble with the positive desire to gain the greatest benefit possible in a spiritual way, and Jehovah richly rewards us for the spirit we show.—1 Tim. 6:6-8; Heb. 11:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> These occasions for encouragement also remind us of the progress of the spiritual harvest. (John 4:35,36) The opening words of Isaiah chapter 54 call upon Jehovah’s wifelike organization to prepare for joyous increases. Further growth, expansion, and renewed strength are in the offing as Isaiah prophesied: “Make the place of your tent more spacious. And let them stretch out the tent cloths of your grand tabernacle. Do not hold back. Lengthen out your tent cords, and make those tent pins of yours strong. For to the right and to the left you will break forth.” Fulfillment of this exciting prophecy has resulted in the phenomenal expansion of true worship that we now see.—Isa. 54:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> It truly does appear to be the course of good judgment to implement this further simplified convention arrangement so that with less distraction all will be able to enjoy the spiritual program that has been prepared. We trust that this also will have Jehovah’s blessing, since it will allow for more efficient handling of further growth. By focusing on what is needed, we will be able to enjoy our planned days of happy fellowship and spiritual good things. It is our sincere prayer that Jehovah will bless all our efforts as we continue to convene and be fed at his table.—Compare Deuteronomy 16:14,15.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> As far as reasonably possible, we want to maintain a good relationship with people who live in our community. This requires that we show consideration and respect for their rights and feelings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s Witnesses are known for good manners. Our standards of decorum in the neighborhood, at school, and in the workplace, as well as at our assemblies, have been the subject of many favorable comments. —See the June 15,1989, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font12">page 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Fine conduct, of course, includes many things, such as honesty, diligence, and good morals. It also includes being respectful of residents who live in the area around our Kingdom Hall. Our godly conduct in other respects may be ignored if we fail to be considerate of our neighbors. Paul urged us to “behave in a manner worthy of the good news.”—Phil. 1:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> From time to time, complaints have been made by residents living near certain Kingdom Halls because of what they feel is a lack of consideration shown by those attending the meetings. Brothers and sisters should avoid congregating on the sidewalk in front of the Kingdom Hall and carrying on animated conversations that can be heard in nearby homes. Children should not be allowed to run in and out of the Kingdom Hall. Thoughtlessly slamming car doors or blowing horns can disturb the neighborhood. Conduct of this type reflects unfavorably on the congregation. Also, it is important that we observe all traffic regulations when driving in the area—Rom. 13:1,2,5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>s</sup> Cars should not be parked on private property or in places where they obstruct traffic or block driveways.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Parking lots maintained by nearby business establishments for their customers should not be used unless permission is given. Where three or four congregations use the same Kingdom Hall, meetings are scheduled virtually every day of the week, and this requires close cooperation between bodies of elders.—See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> October 1,1988, page 17, paragraph 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“The Bible urges us to “do all things for God’s glory,&quot; and that includes showing consideration for outsiders. (1 Cor. 10:31-33) If we ‘keep an eye on the personal interests of others,’ we will not thoughtlessly intrude on their property. (Phil. 2:4) We will also avoid interfering with business activities of local merchants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">’ Showing consideration for others —both inside and outside the congregation—is an outward expression of what we feel in our hearts. What we do and say should demonstrate that we ‘love our neighbors as ourselves.’—Matt. 7:12; 22:39.</span></p>

On one occasion he initiated a conversation with a Samaritan woman by simply asking her for a drink of water. This immediately captured her attention because 'Jews had no dealings with Samaritans.’ The ensuing conversation eventually helped her and many others to become believers. (John 4:7-9, 41) We can learn from his example.</span></p></li>

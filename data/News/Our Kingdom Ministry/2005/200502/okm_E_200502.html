<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ’s Death to Be Commemorated on</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">March 24 *</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>x</sup>The psalmist exclaimed: “O let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loving-kindness and for his wonderful works to the sons of men.” (Ps. 107:8) God’s loving-kindness is more than just the tender regard he has for people. That is made clear in the inspired expression of praise: “Your own loving-kindness, O Jehovah, kept sustaining me.” (Ps. 94:18) What extraordinary loving-kindness Jehovah demonstrated in giving his only-begotten Son in our behalf! —1 John 4:9,10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> As the Memorial of Christ’s death approaches, how can we thank “the God of loving-kindness”? (Ps. 59:17) Each of us will want to set aside time to meditate on Jesus’ final days on earth. (Ps. 143:5) It will also be beneficial to follow the special Bible reading scheduled for the Memorial, as outlined in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Examining the Scriptures Daily—2005 </span><span class="font16">and, if possible, do additional reading and research in chapters 112-16 of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font16"> book along with other Bible-based publications. Linger over the passages you read, and become absorbed in them. (1 Tim. 4:15) Prayerful reflection on God’s Word not only nourishes our heart but also expresses our love for Jehovah.—Matt. 22:37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Incite Others to Thank God: </span><span class="font16">Last year 16,760,607 attended the Memorial worldwide. In a village in Liberia, the brothers wrote a letter to the town chief, informing him of their intention to observe the Lord’s Evening Meal in his town. The chief gave permission for the brothers to use the local football field for the event and had an announcement made about it throughout</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. How has Jehovah shown us loving-kindness?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. How can we show our thankfulness to Jehovah? 3, 4. (a) How can we imitate the spirit of our Liberian brothers? (b) Whom do you plan to invite to the Memorial? </span><span class="font16">the area, inviting people to attend. Though there were only five publishers in that village, the attendance for the Memorial was 636!</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> Likewise, we want to help as many as possible to join us for the Memorial observance. Why not make a list of those you want to invite? The illustrations on the back covers of the March 8 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font16"> and March 15 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font16"> extend an invitation. The printed Memorial invitations can also be used. Type or neatly write the time and location of the commemoration on the slip, and leave one with each person you invite. As March 24 approaches, call again to remind each one and to finalize any arrangements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> How can we help Bible students who are not yet coming to meetings to attend and benefit fully from the event? Spend a few minutes during each study to build appreciation for the importance of the observance. Excellent material can be found in the March 15, 2004, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font16"> pages 3-7, and the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font16"> book, pages 266-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Welcome Visitors: </span><span class="font16">At the Memorial, approach visitors and welcome them. (Rom. 12:13) Arrange to sit with those you invited, and make sure they have a Bible and a songbook. We will especially want to take the initiative to greet warmly any inactive brothers and sisters who have made the effort to attend. Our loving interest may help them to resume regular association with the congregation. (Luke 15:3-7) On this most sacred occasion, may we do all we can to encourage others to join us in giving thanks to Jehovah for his “wonderful loving-kindness.” —Ps. 31:21.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>1</sup> At designated times during the year, the ancient Israelites celebrated “seasonal festivals of Jehovah.” (Lev. 23:2) Taking time to reflect on the goodness of their God resulted in great joy and moved them to be zealous for pure worship.—2 Chron. 30:2131:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>2</sup> In modern times, our joyful theocratic activity intensifies each year during the Memorial season. It is a time when we reflect deeply on the priceless gift Jehovah gave in our behalf —his only-begotten Son.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">(John 3:16; 1 Pet. 1:18, 19) As we meditate on the love shown by God and his Son, we feel impelled to praise Jehovah and to exert ourselves in doing the divine will.—2 Cor. 5:14,15.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">How Will You Increase Your Activity?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">■ Preach when people are at home</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>3</sup> This year the Lord’s Evening Meal will be observed on Thursday, March 24, after sundown. How might we increase our share in the ministry during the months of March, April, and May?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Reaching More People: </span><span class="font16">Look for ways to reach as many people as possible when you share in field service. Can you plan to participate in door-to-door work when more people are at home, such as in the late afternoon or in the evening? If some in your book study group would like to share in service before the study, the book study overseer may be able to arrange to have a brief meeting for service in order to work a nearby territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>5</sup> Another way to reach many people is</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. What effect did “seasonal festivals” have on Godfearing Israelites?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2, 3. Why is it fitting that we increase our spiritual activity during the Memorial season, and when will we observe the Memorial?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4, 5. (a) What has helped some to reach more people with the good news? (b) What have you found to be effective locally?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">by witnessing in public places. A sister in Japan wanted to auxiliary pioneer even though she had a full-time job. An elder suggested that each day before going to her secular job, she might do street witnessing near a train station. After overcoming her own timidity and the ridicule of some commuters, she developed a magazine route of some 40 persons, including commuters, station workers, and nearby shop owners. She placed an average of 235 magazines a month. By sharing Scriptural points with people for just a few moments each day, she was able to start six Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Opportunities to Witness: </span><span class="font16">Many school-age publishers have periods of time off during the year. These may be opportune times to auxiliary pioneer. In addition, Christian youths can increase their activity by giving a witness at school. You may be surprised how curious classmates may be about your beliefs. Why not take advantage of classroom discussions or school essays to give a witness? Others have been able to do so using our videos. Some have started Bible studies with classmates and helped them progress to dedication and baptism. These are fine ways to “praise the name of Jehovah.”—Ps. 148:12, 13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>7</sup> In your daily routine, look for ways to speak with people about our wonderful God and his marvelous promises. One brother who travels on the same trains every day witnesses to fellow commuters when appropriate. For example, while waiting at one station for his next train, he</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">6. How might youths increase their spiritual activity?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">7. (a) How did one brother take advantage of opportunities to witness to others? (b) Have you enjoyed a similar experience?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">witnessed to a young man each day for about five minutes. As a result, the young man and his colleague agreed to a Bible study. The Bible study was conducted on the train as they traveled. Some time later, an elderly woman who had been listening to their conversations approached the brother and asked him for a Bible study. She too is enjoying her study on the days she uses the train. In this way, the brother has studied with ten different individuals on the train.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>8</sup> What if you are limited in what you can do because of advanced age or health problems? There may still be ways you can increase your praise to Jehovah. Have you tried telephone witnessing? If you are unsure of how to go about this, mention it to your book study overseer. He may be able to arrange for publishers who use this method to work with you. Working together as partners, you can learn from one another and help one another to give an effective witness. Fine suggestions for doing telephone witnessing can be found in the February 2001 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font16"> pages 5-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>9</sup> Attending the Memorial may stimulate new ones to want to increase their praise to Jehovah. You can help them to overcome any apprehension they may have about sharing in the formal preaching work by relating positive field service experiences and by progressively training them to explain Bible teachings and defend their faith. (1 Pet. 3:15) If a Bible student expresses a desire to begin publishing the good news, speak with the presiding overseer. He will arrange for a meeting with the student to determine whether he qualifies to share with the congregation in the public ministry. How it must make Jehovah’s heart rejoice to see new ones take their stand on his side of the universal issue! —Prov. 27:11.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">9. How can we help Bible students to qualify to share with the congregation in the public ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Can You Auxiliary Pioneer? </span><span class="font16">The auxiliary pioneer requirement of 50 hours should be viewed seriously. (Matt. 5:37) This means that you will need to arrange to spend an average of 12 hours in field service each week. Does one of the sample auxiliary pioneer schedules on page 5 fit your circumstances? If not, can you arrange a schedule that will enable you to auxiliary pioneer in March, April, or May? Ask Jehovah to bless your efforts to increase your service activity.—Prov. 16:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>11</sup> The elders and ministerial servants will fully support your endeavors to make this Memorial season one of special praise to Jehovah. Likely, many of them will be auxiliary pioneering. The elders will arrange to have extra meetings for service, such as in late afternoons, on weekday evenings, and on weekends, as needed. To determine where and when such meetings will be held and who will be available to take the lead, the elders may speak with those who have definite plans to pioneer or who are considering doing so. The elders will strive to coordinate the arrangements so that there will be other publishers to work with on the days and times that you have set aside for service. In this way, plans can be firmly established and much good can be accomplished.—Prov. 20:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> Do Your Utmost: </span><span class="font16">If your circumstances do not allow you to auxiliary pioneer, remember that Jehovah accepts our efforts and sacrifices ‘according to what we have, not according to what we do not have.’ (2 Cor. 8:12) We have so much for which to thank Jehovah. With good reason David wrote: “I will bless Jehovah at all times; constantly his praise will be in my mouth.” (Ps. 34:1) May that be our determination during this Memorial season.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>^Memorial Reminders*</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Memorial observance this year falls on Thursday, March 24. The elders should give attention to the following matters:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">■ In setting the time for the meeting, make sure that the emblems will not be passed until after sundown.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">■ Everyone, including the speaker, should be informed of the exact time and location of the observance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">■ The appropriate type of bread and wine should be obtained and made ready.—See the February 15,2003, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font17"> pp. 14-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">■ Plates, glasses, and a suitable table and tablecloth should be brought to the hall and put in place in advance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">■ The Kingdom Hall or other meeting place should be thoroughly cleaned ahead of time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">■ Attendants and servers should be selected and instructed in advance about their duties, the proper procedure to be followed, and the need for dignified dress and grooming.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">■ Arrangements should be made to serve any of the anointed who are infirm and unable to be present.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">■ When more than one congregation is scheduled to use the same Kingdom Hall, there should be good coordination among congregations so as to avoid unnecessary congestion in the lobby or entryway, on the public sidewalks, and in the parking lot.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Conducting Progressive Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 6: When a Student Raises a Question</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Once a Bible study is well established, it is usually best to consider Bible teachings in an orderly manner rather than jump from subject to subject. This helps the student to build a foundation of accurate knowledge and to progress spiritually. (Col. 1: 9, 10) Often, though, students raise questions on various subjects during the study. How should these be handled?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Be Discerning: </span><span class="font2">Questions related to the study material being considered can usually be answered on the spot. If a question will be addressed later in the study publication, it may be sufficient simply to point that out. However, if a question is unrelated to the study material or will require research to answer properly, it may be better to consider the matter after the study or at another time. Some find that writing the question down assures the student that his question is being taken seriously and helps prevent the study from becoming sidetracked.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Many Bible teachings are considered only briefly in our basic study publications. What if a student has difficulty accepting a certain teaching or holds strongly to a false belief? It may be beneficial to consider additional material that thoroughly discusses what the Bible says on that subject. If the student is still not convinced, leave the subject for another time and continue on with his regular study. (John 16:12) As he gains a broader knowledge of the Bible and progresses spiritually, he may come to understand that Bible teaching.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Be Modest: </span><span class="font2">If you are not sure of the answer to a question, resist the temptation to venture an opinion. (2 Tim. 2: 15; 1 Pet. 4:11) Explain that you will research the matter and return with an answer. You might even use the opportunity to teach the student how to do research. Progressively show him how to use the various research tools provided by Jehovah’s organization. In this way he will eventually be able to answer his own questions. —Acts 17:11.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Them Receive a Further Witness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>x</sup>As we share the good news, we often meet people who live outside our territory or who speak another language, including sign language. Others with whom we have enjoyed good Bible discussions may move out of our territory. How can we arrange for such ones to receive a further witness? By using the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Please Follow Up</span><span class="font2"> (S-43) form.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> People often listen more intently to the good news when it is presented in their mother tongue. (Acts 22:1, 2) Hence, in most cases, when we meet someone who speaks another language, we should fill out the form </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">even if the person does not show interest in the Kingdom message. </span><span class="font2">However, where there is a sizable foreign-language population that is regularly receiving a witness in their own language, it may not be necessary to fill out the form except when interest is shown.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Filling Out the Form: </span><span class="font2">Tactfully endeavor to obtain the person’s name, his address, and his telephone number. Indicate the degree of interest shown, when the person can be reached, the literature that was placed or requested, and the language that the person best understands. After completing the form, promptly give it to the congregation secretary, who will forward it to the appropriate congregation or group.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Forwarding the Form: </span><span class="font2">If the secretary does not know which congregation or group should receive the form or does not have the mailing address, he may telephone the Territory Desk at the branch office to obtain the needed information. It is no longer necessary to involve the city overseer when forwarding the form.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Whenever a congregation or a group receives a completed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Please Follow Up</span><span class="font2"> form, arrangements should be made to call on the person promptly. As we diligently do our part, we can be confident that Jehovah will open the hearts of those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” —Acts 13:48.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> “Interesting, timely, and uplifting.” “The most encouraging journals I’ve ever read.” These comments well describe how readers the world over feel about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> Indeed, our magazines have proved to be invaluable tools in reaching “all sorts of men” with the good news. —1 Tim. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> A career-oriented man obtained an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> magazine on a subject that interested him. Later, he read the accompanying issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font2">which contained an article that prompted him to scrutinize his lifelong belief in the Trinity. This sparked his interest. Six months later he was baptized. Another man regularly received the magazines but never read them. His wife, on the other hand, avoided the Witnesses but read the magazines left with her husband. Her heart was touched by the Bible’s promise of an earthly paradise filled with righteous people. In time, she, her son, and her sister became servants of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Offer Them as a Set: </span><span class="font2">As the foregoing examples show, we cannot be sure who will read our magazines or what may arouse their interest. (Eccl. 11:6) Therefore, it is advantageous to offer </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> together as a set, even though we will generally highlight only one magazine in our presentation. In certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to offer several differ-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">1, 2. How have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> touched people’s lives?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">3. What is the advantage of offering the magazines as a set?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">ent issues of our magazines on a visit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> It is beneficial to schedule one day each week to share in magazine work. On the 2005 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses,</span><span class="font2"> every Saturday is designated as “Magazine Day.” Of course, since local and personal circumstances vary, some may set aside another day to focus on offering our journals. Is this part of your weekly schedule?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Set a Personal Goal: </span><span class="font2">Setting a personal monthly goal of magazine placements can help us to be more magazine conscious. Do you have a magazine route? Do you offer magazines to those whom you meet in the ministry? Could you offer magazines in street work, in business territory, and in public places? Do you carry magazines with you when traveling, shopping, and going to appointments? Take advantage of every appropriate opportunity to help others benefit from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>

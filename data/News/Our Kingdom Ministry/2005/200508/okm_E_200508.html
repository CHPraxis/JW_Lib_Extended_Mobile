<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Preaching—A Precious Privilege</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Daily, billions of earth’s inhabitants benefit from Jehovah’s generous provisions for life. (Matt. 5:45) However, very few enjoy the unique privilege of showing appreciation to their Creator by preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom. (Matt. 24:14) How highly do you esteem this precious privilege?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Kingdom preaching honors God and brings hope and peace to people who are distressed by today’s turbulent times. (Heb. 13:15) To those who respond to the message, it means everlasting life. (John 17:3) What secular career or profession offers such benefits? The apostle Paul demonstrated his appreciation for the ministry in the way he carried it out. He viewed it as a treasure.—Acts 20:20, 21, 24; 2 Cor. 4:1, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Treasuring Our Precious Privilege: </span><span class="font11">One way we show appreciation for the privilege to preach is by giving attention to the quality of our service. Do we take time to prepare a presentation that will touch the hearts of our listeners? Can we improve our skill in using the Scriptures and in reasoning with people? Do we work our assigned territory thoroughly? Can we start and conduct a Bible study? Like faithful Christians, both past and present, we are motivated by a proper view of this activity, and we cherish our privilege. —Matt. 25:14-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> When we are dealing with the effects of advanced age, poor health, or other difficult circumstances, it is comforting to know that our zealous efforts to share in the ministry are indeed highly valued. God’s Word assures us that Jehovah values such efforts in serving him, even those efforts that may not seem impressive in the eyes of others. —Luke 21:1-4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Kingdom preaching is a source of great satisfaction. A 92-year-old sister said: “What a privilege to look back over 80 years of dedicated service to God—with no regrets! If I could live my life again, I would live it the same way because, indeed, ‘God’s loving-kindness is better than life itself.’” (Ps. 63:3) May we too treasure this precious privilege from God—the Kingdom-preaching work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Conducting Progressive Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 12: Helping Students Start and Conduct Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> When our Bible students begin sharing in the field ministry, they may be intimidated by the thought of starting and conducting their own Bible studies. How can we help them develop a positive attitude toward this essential part of our ministry?—Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Once a Bible student qualifies to be an unbaptized publisher, he is likely already taking full advantage of the Theocratic Ministry School. The training he receives in preparing and presenting student assignments will help him to develop the teaching skills that are needed by “a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.” —2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Teach by Your Example: </span><span class="font11">Jesus trained his disciples by giving clear instruction and setting a fine example. He said: “Everyone that is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher.” (Luke 6: 40) Your imitating Jesus by setting a proper example in your own ministry is vital. As your student observes your lead in the ministry, he will appreciate that the objective in making return visits is to start Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Explain that when we offer a study, it is not generally necessary to describe the study arrangement in detail. Often it is best simply to demonstrate the study by using one or perhaps two paragraphs from a study publication. Helpful suggestions for doing this can be found on page 8 of this issue and on page 6 of the January 2002 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> When appropriate, invite the student to accompany you or another experienced publisher on other Bible studies. He might share in commenting on a paragraph or a key scripture. Thus, by observation, the student will learn much about conducting progressive Bible studies. (Prov. 27:17; 2 Tim. 2:2) Give him commendation, and discuss how he can improve.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Training new publishers to be teachers of God’s Word will equip them for the “good work” of starting and conducting studies of their own. (2 Tim. 3:17) How satisfying it is to work side by side with them in extending the loving invitation: “Let anyone that wishes take life’s water free”!—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Service Meeting Schedule</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE: </span><span class="font11">A month or two after the congregation attends the “Godly Obedience” District Convention, 15 to 20 minutes should be set aside on the Service Meeting (perhaps using a local needs portion) for a review of points from the convention that the publishers have found to be helpful in the field ministry. The special Service Meeting part will give us the opportunity to explain how we are using what we learned at the convention and how it has helped make our ministry more effective. —See the April 2005 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> p. 2.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Now Is the Time to Preach!</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “Fear God and give him glory.” Under angelic direction, this message is being declared “to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.” Why? “Because the hour of the judgment by [God] </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">has arrived.”</span><span class="font11"> Today, we are living in that ‘hour of Judgment,’ which will culminate with the destruction of the present system of things. It is vital for people to “worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.” No other work being done today can compare in importance or urgency with the proclamation of the “everlasting good news.” Yes, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font11"> is the time to preach! —Rev. 14:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> During the past ten years, servants of Jehovah have spent nearly 12 billion hours in the Kingdom-preaching and disciplemaking work. Many have made adjustments in their lives in order to share more fully in the spiritual harvest. (Matt. 9:37, 38) Last year, for example, an average of over 850,000 publishers each month served as pioneers. For regular pioneers, this requires spending an average of 70 hours every month in the preaching work. For auxiliary pioneers, the requirement is 50 hours.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> How to Pioneer: </span><span class="font11">Recognizing that “the time left is reduced,” pioneers strive to keep their life simple. (1 Cor. 7:29,31) They look for ways to reduce expenses so that they can spend less time doing secular work. For example, some have moved into smaller dwellings. Others have eliminated unnecessary material possessions. (Matt. 6:19-21) Often, they must also curtail personal pursuits. All of this is done with the goal of devoting more time and attention to the ministry. (Eph. 5:15, 16) With persistence, a self-sacrificing spirit, and prayerful reliance on Jehovah, many publishers have been able to arrange a practical schedule that enables them to pioneer.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. Why is now the time to preach?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2. How are servants of Jehovah demonstrating that they recognize the urgency of the times?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">3. What adjustments do publishers often need to make in order to pioneer?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Can you pioneer? Why not ask successful pioneers how they are able to do it? Work with them in the field ministry, and experience their joy. Consider articles on pioneering that have appeared in our publications. Set practical goals for yourself that can serve as stepping-stones to pioneering. If there are obstacles that presently prevent you from serving as a pioneer, bring them before Jehovah in prayer, and ask him to help you resolve them.—Prov. 16:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Blessings and Joys: </span><span class="font11">Pioneering sharpens our skills in the use of God’s Word, which in turn brings increased joy. “Being able to handle God’s Word of truth aright is a real blessing,” commented one young pioneer sister. “When you pioneer, you use the Bible so much. Now when I go from door to door, I can think of scriptures that are appropriate for each householder.”—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Pioneering also teaches many valuable life skills. It can help young people learn how to budget time wisely, how to manage finances, and how to get along with people. Many develop a more spiritual outlook on life as a result of pioneering. (Eph. 4:13) Furthermore, pioneers are often privileged to see Jehovah’s hand at work in their behalf.—Acts 11:21; Phil. 4:11-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Perhaps one of the greatest blessings of pioneering is that it helps us draw close to Jehovah. This can sustain us through trials. A sister who endured a period of severe difficulty said: “The close relationship that I have developed with Jehovah through pioneering helped me through it all.” She added: “I feel so happy that I’ve spent my adult life serving Jehovah full-time. It has enabled me to give of myself in ways I never thought I could.” (Acts 20:35) May we likewise experience rich blessings as we do our utmost in the all-important preaching work. —Prov. 10:22.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11">6. What training does pioneering provide?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Using Handbills?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">One day an 11-year-old boy found a handbill advertising a public lecture on the subject of hell. “This keenly interested me,” he later explained, “as it seemed that I was always doing the wrong thing, and so I worried a lot about going to a burning hell when I died.” He attended the lecture, and about a year later, after several sessions of Bible study, he was baptized. Thus began the Christian career of Karl Klein, who later served for many years as a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It all began with a handbill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Handbills continue to be an effective witnessing tool today. Many publishers find that handing one to a person is a good way to introduce themselves and start conversations. Parents can involve their young children in the ministry by having them offer a handbill at the door. Publishers who share in witnessing by letter can advertise the meetings by enclosing a handbill. And, of course, handbills are a convenient way to invite Bible students and other interested ones to come to our meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the front of the handbill is a brief description of each congregation meeting. Since the Kingdom Hall address and meeting times are not included, you will need to supply that information when offering the handbill. There is space to print or stamp that information on the handbill if desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Are you making good use of handbills in your ministry?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit Assembly Program</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">During the final days of this corrupt old world, it is vital that we maintain our spiritual attire and safeguard our Christian identity. (Rev. 16:15) It is appropriate, therefore, that the theme of the circuit assembly program for the 2006 service year is “Clothe Yourselves With the New Personality.”—Col. 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">First Day: </span><span class="font11">The first symposium, “Manifesting Aspects of the New Personality,” will highlight how cultivating the new personality benefits us in every area of our lives. How do we cultivate the new personality? That will be considered in the last two talks of the first day, “Discipline Yourself to Meditate Properly” and “Education That Molds the New Personality.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Second Day: </span><span class="font11">How the new personality influences our use of the tongue will be considered in the second symposium, “Cultivating the Tongue of Wise Ones.” “Are You Conquering the Wicked One?” is the theme of the public address, which will highlight the need to remain alert to Satan’s tactics. The last two talks of the assembly, “Keep Yourself Without Spot From the World” and “Daily Renewing the Man We Are Inside,” will help us to shun attitudes and conduct that conflict with God’s righteous ways and to remain steadfast in our worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How we look forward to receiving this encouragement to put on and maintain the new personality!</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The eye is a marvel of design. (Ps. 139:14) Yet, it can focus on only one thing at a time. That is true both literally and figuratively. For our spiritual vision to be clear and in focus, we must center our attention on doing God’s will. In view of the everincreasing distractions of Satan’s world, how appropriate that the special assembly day program for the 2006 service year will develop the theme “Keep Your Eye Simple”!—Matt. 6:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How can we put ourselves in line to receive blessings from Jehovah? (Prov. 10:22) This question will be considered in the part “Reap Blessings for Keeping a Simple Eye.” Interviews will highlight how we can benefit from applying Scriptural principles. The first talk by the visiting speaker, “Keeping a Simple Eye in a Wicked World,” will warn us of things that can complicate our lives and gradually choke our spirituality. We will also learn what is involved in choosing “the good portion.”—Luke 10:42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How can parents and others encourage young Christians to focus on spiritual pursuits? The parts “Parents Who Aim Their Arrows Aright” and “Youths Who Reach Out for Spiritual Goals” will include expressions from parents and youths on this important question. (Ps. 127:4) The concluding talk by the visiting speaker will consider how we can keep pace with Jehovah’s organization as individuals, as families, and as a congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Whether we are newly acquainted with the truth or have been serving Jehovah for decades, it is vital that we ‘keep our eye simple.’ The special assembly day program will help us to do just that.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A Witness Without Words</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Without uttering a word, Jehovah’s physical creation speaks volumes about his invisible qualities. (Ps. 19: 1-3; Rom. 1:20) Similarly, our fine conduct, Christian qualities, and modest appearance give a witness without words. (1 Pet. 2:12; 3:1-4) It should be the desire of each of us to “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things” by the way we comport ourselves.—Titus 2:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> How is it possible for imperfect humans to add luster to Bible teachings? This is possible only through the guidance of God’s Word and the power of holy spirit. (Ps. 119:105; 143:10) God’s word “is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword.” (Heb. 4:12) It penetrates deep within us and enables us to put on the new personality. (Col. 3:9,10) Holy spirit produces in us desirable qualities, such as kindness, goodness, mildness, and self-control. (Gal. 5:22, 23) Are we individually allowing God’s word and spirit to work in our lives?—Eph. 4:30; 1 Thess. 2:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Others Take Notice: </span><span class="font11">When we live by Jehovah’s standards and strive to reflect his qualities, others take notice. Consider, for example, a man who was ridiculed by his workmates because he was short. A sister who worked in the same office always treated him with dignity and respect. This moved him to ask her why she was so different. She explained that her respectful conduct was the result of applying Bible principles in her life. She also shared with him the marvelous Kingdom hope. The man began to study the Bible and eventually progressed to baptism. When he returned to his homeland, his relatives were impressed by his fine conduct, and several of them also accepted the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> At work, in school, or in dealing with relatives and neighbors, we can by our fine conduct, along with our witnessing, cause others to give glory to God.—Matt. 5:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Starting Bible Studies at the Doorstep and by Telephone</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> People today are busy. Yet, many have an interest in spiritual things. How can we help them to satisfy their spiritual need? (Matt. 5:3) Many publishers are able to study the Bible with people at their doorstep or by telephone. Could you expand your ministry in this manner?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> To start Bible studies, we need to be prepared to demonstrate a Bible study whenever the opportunity presents itself. How and where can this be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> At the Doorstep: </span><span class="font11">When you meet a person who is willing to converse about the Bible, simply open to a paragraph that you have prepared in advance, such as the first paragraph of lesson 1 in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require </span><span class="font11">brochure, and begin. Read the paragraph, consider the question, and discuss one or two cited scriptures. Often this can be done right at the doorstep in five to ten minutes. If the person enjoys the discussion, make an arrangement to consider the next paragraph or two at another time.—Further suggestions on using the direct approach to start studies can be found in the January 2002 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom. Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> p. 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> A similar approach can be used to start Bible studies when making return visits. For example, you might introduce the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font11"> brochure and feature God’s name, using les-</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">3. Why demonstrate a Bible study on the initial call, and how can this be done?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">4. How might we start a Bible study at the doorstep when making return visits? son 2, paragraphs 1-2. On the next visit, you could discuss what the Bible reveals about Jehovah’s qualities, using paragraphs 3-4. For the following discussion, you could consider paragraphs 5-6 and the picture on page 5 to highlight how a study of the Bible helps us to get to know Jehovah. All of this can take place while standing at the doorstep.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> By Telephone: </span><span class="font11">Some people may be more willing to study the Bible by telephone than in person. Consider the following experience: While preaching from house to house, a sister met a young woman who is a mother and a busy career woman. When the sister was unable to contact her again at home, she decided to telephone her. The young woman explained that she really did not have time to discuss the Bible. The sister said: “In 10 or 15 minutes, you can learn something new, even by telephone.” “Well, if it’s by phone, then, OK!” answered the woman. Before long, a regular study was being conducted over the telephone.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Would some of those whom you visit be willing to study by telephone? You could try the approach just described, or you might simply say: “If you prefer, we could discuss the Bible by telephone. Would that be better for you?” By adapting our Bible study program to the circumstances of others, we may help them to “find the very knowledge of God.”—Prov. 2:5; 1 Cor. 9:23.</span></p></li></ul>

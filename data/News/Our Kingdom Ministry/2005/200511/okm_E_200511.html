<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Declare Jehovah’s Glory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The psalmist proclaimed: “Sing to Jehovah, all you people of the earth.... Declare among the nations his glory, among all the peoples his wonderful works.” As we ponder what Jehovah has done, is doing, and will yet do for us, our hearts stir us to declare his glory!—Ps. 96: 1,3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> In Our Ministry: </span><span class="font10">Jehovah’s Witnesses are privileged to bear God’s name and to praise it publicly throughout the earth. (Mal. 1:11) What a contrast to Christendom’s clergy, who presumptuously remove God’s name from their Bible translations! The work of making known God’s name is urgent, since people must call upon that name in faith in order to be saved through the coming great tribulation. (Rom. 10:1315) Moreover, universal peace, including peace among earth’s inhabitants, depends on the sanctification of God’s name. Indeed, all of God’s works are linked to his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> “Jehovah is great and very much to be praised.” But in order for people to “ascribe to Jehovah the glory belonging to his name,” they must know the truth about him. (Ps. 96:4, 8) However, some deny that God exists. (Ps. 14:1) Others malign him as powerless, or they claim that he is not interested in mankind’s affairs. As we help honesthearted ones gain accurate knowledge about our Creator, his purposes, and his endearing personality, we glorify Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> By Our Conduct: </span><span class="font10">Living in harmony with Jehovah’s righteous standards honors him. Our fine conduct does not go unnoticed. (1 Pet. 2:12) For example, our clean and neat personal appearance may elicit favorable comments from others, providing us with an opportunity to talk about the benefits of living by the principles found in God’s Word. (1 Tim. 2:9, 10) How delighted we are when others ‘see our fine works and give glory to our Father who is in the heavens’!—Matt. 5:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> By word and deed, let us extol our magnificent God each day, thereby responding to the joyful call: “Sing to Jehovah, bless his name. From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.”—Ps. 96:2.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Personal Interest —By Being Observant</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah God and Christ Jesus excel in recognizing the specific needs of people and in offering them assistance. (2 Chron. 16:9; Mark 6:34) When we identify the interests and concerns of those we meet in our ministry, we may be able to adapt our presentation of the good news accordingly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Be Attentive to Details: </span><span class="font10">Jesus was observant. (Mark 12:4143; Luke 19:1-6) Similarly, when we approach the householder’s door and take note of religious decorations, slogans on vehicles, or toys in the yard, we may be able to create opportunities to give an effective witness of the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> A person’s facial expressions and demeanor may indicate something about his feelings. (Prov. 15:13) Perhaps the loss of a loved one or some other distressing circumstance has left him in need of comfort. Sharing some appropriate scriptures may be appreciated. (Prov. 16:24) Is the householder rushing out the door or holding a crying baby? If so, it may be better to arrange to call at another time. By being considerate and “showing fellow feeling,” we may move the person to listen when we return.—1 Pet. 3:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Adapt Your Comments: </span><span class="font10">The apostle Paul observed that the city of Athens had an altar dedicated “To an Unknown God.” This influenced the way he presented the good news, for he said: “What you are unknowingly giving godly devotion to, this I am publishing to you.” Paul’s tactful approach moved some of those present to give consideration to the Kingdom message and to become believers.—Acts 17:23, 34.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>6</sup> In like manner, our being observant helps us to discern a person’s interests and thus allows us to tailor our approach. Use questions that might serve to draw out the householder. Think of scriptures that could be used to heighten his interest. (Prov. 20:5) Our being observant and showing sincere personal interest in others will help us to share the good news skillfully.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">■ Literature offer for </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">November: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Learn From the Great Teacher.</span><span class="font9"> If individuals say they have no children, offer the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font9"> book or the tract </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> December: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.</span><span class="font9"> As an alternative offer, you may use </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?,</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> January: </span><span class="font9">Any book published prior to 1991 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Worship the Only True God.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> February: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Draw Close to Jehovah.</span><span class="font9"> If this publication is not available, you may use the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font9"> book as an alternative offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. If a separate checking account is maintained, such as for maintenance or construction, arrangements should also be made to audit this account. When the audit(s) have been completed, this should be announced to the congregation with the next accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ The secretary of each congregation holding title to property should review paragraphs 42-4 in the form entitled </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Information Regarding Ownership of Kingdom Halls</span><span class="font9"> (T-36). Even after real-estate tax exemption has been obtained, an annual filing is required in some states. Check carefully with your local tax assessor’s office to confirm whether any action is required. All taxes and assessments are to be paid within the time provided. If any tax or assessment is questioned, promptly follow through on the matter so that either it is removed or a proper challenge is filed within the applicable time limit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Donations made by check and put in the local Kingdom Hall contribution boxes for the worldwide work and the Kingdom Hall Fund should be made payable to “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Donations made by check at district conventions and those sent to the branch office should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” The branch office financial address is Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, c/o Office of the Secretary and Treasurer, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 112012483.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ If you are admitted to a hospital and want visiting local elders and, in larger cities, elders serving on a Patient Visitation Group to have access to your name, what must you do? When identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you should also explain that you are willing to have a minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses visit you. A federal law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), protects your privacy, but with your consent, the law allows for the elders to learn of your admission and provide spiritual encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ It is necessary for the branch office to maintain an up-to-date record of addresses and telephone numbers for all presiding overseers and secretaries. If there is a change at any time, the Congregation Service Committee should complete, sign, and send a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Presiding Overseer/Secretary Change of Address</span><span class="font9"> (S-29) form to the branch office promptly. This includes any changes in telephone area codes.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How Can We Help?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The question “How can we help?” is often raised by Jehovah’s Witnesses when they hear of a disaster that has occurred in some part of the world. As the account at Acts 11:27-30 shows, Christians in the first century provided a relief ministration to the brothers dwelling in Judea because of a famine that took place.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>2</sup> In modern times, our organizational charters have permitted money to be used for charitable activity and to provide humanitarian assistance to those suffering from natural or man-made disasters and in other times of need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> For example, last year many brothers contributed toward helping those affected by the tsunami disaster in South Asia. This heartfelt response in the way of donations to the organization’s relief funds was very much appreciated. However, when donations are earmarked specifically for a certain disaster, it is necessary in some countries to use such funds only for the purpose specified by the donor and within a certain period of time, whether the needs of our brothers have been cared for locally or not.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>4</sup> Consequently, it is recommended that donations for humanitarian and relief assistance be made to the worldwide work. This fund is used for relief efforts as well as for advancing the spiritual needs of the Christian brotherhood. If, for some reason, a person wishes to make a relief donation separate from contributions to the worldwide work, it will still be accepted and used wherever there is a need for relief assistance. However, it would be appreciated if such donations are made without restrictions as to where and how the funds may be used.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Our directing donations primarily to the worldwide work allows for more funds to be available for use in connection with all features of the Kingdom work rather than being held only for future relief needs. This is in harmony with the spirit of Ephesians 4:16, that we work together to give what is needed “for the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.”</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>What Our Ministry Accomplishes</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> God’s Word describes Christians as marching triumphantly in Jehovah’s service, as though in a victory procession. (2 Cor. 2: 14-16) As we make known the knowledge of God, our offerings of service are like pleasing incense to Jehovah. Some people are drawn to the sweetness of the good news; others turn away from it. But the negative response of the majority does not mean that our work is unsuccessful. Consider what our ministry accomplishes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Magnifying Jehovah: </span><span class="font10">Satan contends that humans serve Jehovah for selfish reasons. (Job 1:9-11) The Christian ministry provides us with an opportunity to demonstrate that our devotion to God is genuine. Many publishers continue to obey the command to preach and make disciples despite difficult personal circumstances or the indifference of people in general. Such loyal endurance makes Jehovah’s heart rejoice! —Prov. 27:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>3</sup> Additionally, our ministry plays a role in the outworking of God’s purpose. In connection with the coming destruction of Satan’s world, Jehovah says: “The nations will have to know that I am Jehovah.” (Ezek. 39:7) For the nations to know this, it is imperative that God’s servants continue declaring his name and purpose “to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.”—Rev. 14:6, 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. How does Jehovah view our ministry, and what is the response of humans?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. What does our ministry enable us to demonstrate?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. Why is it so important for us to continue making known God’s name and purpose?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Basis for Judgment: </span><span class="font10">The preaching of the good news also serves as a basis for judgment. The apostle Paul stated that Christ Jesus will bring vengeance upon “those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus.” (2 Thess. 1: 8, 9) People will be judged by their response to the good news. What a serious responsibility this places upon God’s servants! In order to avoid bloodguilt, we must not hold back from making known the lifesaving Kingdom message.—Acts 20:26, 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>5</sup> Our ongoing efforts to help our neighbors gain God’s favor are an expression of Jehovah’s mercy. (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) Knowing that the lives of people are constantly changing, we go to them again and again and urge them to seek Jehovah while there is yet time. By so doing, we reflect “the tender compassion of our God,” who “does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.”—Luke 1: 78; 2 Pet. 3:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Benefiting Ourselves: </span><span class="font10">Keeping busy in Jehovah’s service is a protection for us. It helps us to keep “close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah” and to avoid becoming defiled by the present wicked system of things. (2 Pet. 3:11-14; Titus 2:11, 12) May we, therefore, be “steadfast, unmovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord,” knowing that our efforts in the Christian ministry are not in vain.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">4. How does the preaching work serve as a basis for judgment?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10">5. How is God’s mercy reflected in our ministry?</span></p></li>

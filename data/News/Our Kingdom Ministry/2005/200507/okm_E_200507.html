<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A Debt We Owe to Others</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul felt an obligation to preach to people. He knew that Jehovah had made it possible for all sorts of men to be saved by means of the precious blood of His Son. (1 Tim. 2:3-6) Therefore, Paul stated: “Both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to wise and to senseless ones I am a debtor.” He eagerly and tirelessly labored to discharge his debt to his fellow humans by sharing the good news with them.—Rom. 1:14,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Like Paul, Christians today seek to share the good news with their neighbors at every opportunity. With the “great tribulation” fast approaching, our search for honesthearted ones is urgent. May genuine love for people move us to be diligent in this lifesaving work.—Matt. 24:21; Ezek. 33:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Discharging Our Debt: </span><span class="font14">The principal way in which we reach people is by preaching from door to door. In territories where there are many notat-homes, keeping accurate records and returning at different times will enable us to contact more people. (1 Cor. 10:33) We can also reach individuals by witnessing in business territory, on the streets, in parks, in parking lots, and over the telephone. We could ask ourselves, ‘Am I doing my best to pursue all avenues of preaching in order to share the message of life?’ —Matt. 10:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> One pioneer felt a keen responsibility to reach all the people in her territory. At one house, the blinds were always shut and no one was ever at home. However, one day when the pioneer was not in service, she noticed a car in front of this perpetual not-at-home. Not wanting the opportunity to slip by, she rang the doorbell. A man answered, and the initial conversation led to several return visits by this sister and her husband. Eventually, the man accepted a Bible study, and he is now a baptized brother. He is grateful that this sister felt a debt of responsibility to preach to others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> With time fast running out, now is the time to pay our debt to our fellowman by exerting ourselves vigorously in the preaching work.—2 Cor. 6:1, 2.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Conducting Progressive Bible Studies Part 11: Helping Students to Make Return Visits</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> When a Bible student begins to share in the preaching work, he will meet people who show interest in the good news. How can we help the new publisher to make effective return visits and to cultivate the interest he finds?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>2</sup> Preparation for a return visit begins with the initial call. Encourage the student to take a sincere interest in those with whom he speaks. (Phil. 2:4) Progressively train him to draw them out, to listen to their comments, and to note the things that concern them. When someone shows interest, have the new publisher write down the pertinent information about the call. Use that information to help him plan further discussions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Preparing to Return: </span><span class="font14">Review the initial call, and show the student how to select an aspect of the Kingdom message that will appeal to the householder. (1 Cor. 9:19-23) Prepare together a brief presentation that features one Bible text along with a paragraph in a study publication. In addition, prepare a question that can be raised at the conclusion of the discussion to lay the groundwork for the next visit. Show the new publisher how to add to the person’s knowledge of God’s Word with each successive visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> It is also helpful to provide the student with a simple introduction. After greeting the householder, he might say: “I eryoyed our previous conversation, and I have returned to share further Bible information on [mention the topic].” You may also need to show the new publisher how to respond if a different person answers the door.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Follow Up Diligently: </span><span class="font14">Encourage the student to set a good example in returning promptly on all who show interest. Finding people at home may require persistence in calling back. Teach the student how to make appointments to visit again, and help him appreciate the need to return as promised. (Matt. 5:37) Train the new publisher to be kind, considerate, and respectful as he searches for sheeplike ones and cultivates their interest.—Titus 3:2.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Your Children Progress in the Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Christian parents shoulder the serious responsibility of training their children in the ministry from a young age. This may be achieved in a number of ways. Some children are able to recite an appropriate Bible text even before they are able to read. This can have a powerful effect on listeners. As little ones get older, they can do even more in the ministry. How can you parents help your children to share in giving a witness? Perhaps the following suggestions will be of further help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup><a name="bookmark11"></a>2</sup> After a greeting, you might say:</span></h5></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ “My son, [his name], has a meaningful scripture that he would like to call to your attention.” Your child may say: “This scripture in Psalms taught me God’s name. [Child reads or recites Psalm 83:18.] These magazines talk about what Jehovah God will do for us. May I leave them with you?” You could conclude the conversation by explaining how the worldwide work is supported.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup><a name="bookmark13"></a>3</sup> Or you might try this approach:</span></h5></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">■ “Hello. I am training my daughter, [her name], to show concern for others in the community. She would like to share a brief Bible message with you.” She could say: “One way I like to help people is by sharing the Bible’s hope for the future. [Child reads or recites Revelation 21:4.] These magazines explain what God’s Kingdom will do for us. I think you will enjoy reading them.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>4</sup> Consistently using a simplified presentation allows children to gain confidence in their ability to share the Kingdom message. Practice sessions that focus on speaking clearly and with adequate volume will equip them to speak under a variety of circumstances. Good advance preparation and sincere commendation will help little ones to express their faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> With such encouragement, many young ones have qualified as unbaptized publishers. What a joy it is to see our children making progress in the Christian ministry!—Ps. 148:12, 13.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaching as Many People as Possible</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>1</sup> Jesus’ early followers earnestly sought to spread the Kingdom message. They took practical steps to make the good news available to as many people as possible. Christian Bible writers penned their inspired writings in the common Greek, which was the international language of the Roman Empire. Further, zealous preachers of the second and third centuries C.E. on may have pioneered the use of the codex, which was easier to use than a scroll for looking up references.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Use of Technology: </span><span class="font14">Through the prophet Isaiah, Jehovah foretold: “You will actually suck the milk of nations.” (Isa. 60:16) In the modern-day fulfillment of this prophecy, Jehovah’s servants are making use of valuable resources from the nations to advance the preaching work. For example, in 1914, years before talking motion pictures became successful commercially, the Bible Students began showing the “Photo-Drama of Creation.” This eight-hour-long motion picture and slide presentation, complete with color and sound, gave a powerful witness to millions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">’Today, God’s people make use of high-speed printing presses and computerized tools to publish Bibles and Bible literature in hundreds of languages. Rapid means of transport move Bible literature to distant parts of the earth,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">1. What did the early Christians do to reach as many people as possible with the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">2, 3. (a) How is Isaiah 60:16 being fulfilled in modern times? (b) How is technology being used to advance pure worship? reaching people in 235 lands. Through his spirit, Jehovah has impelled his servants to put such technology to practical use, making Bible truth available to more people than ever before in history.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Personal Adjustments: </span><span class="font14">True worshippers have also been motivated to make personal adjustments so as to reach more people with the good news. Many have simplified their lives in order to have a fuller share in the preaching work. Some have moved to serve where there is a greater need for Kingdom pro-claimers. Others have expanded their ministry by learning a foreign language.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>5</sup> In addition, we can reach more people with the good news by preaching </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">when</span><span class="font14"> people are at home and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">where</span><span class="font14"> people can be found. If people are often not at home during the day in your territory, could you adjust your schedule to witness during the early evening hours? Are there public places where a witness can be given? Have you tried telephone witnessing and working business territory? Do you look for opportunities to witness informally?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14"><sup>6</sup> How privileged we are to share in the grand witness being given about Jehovah’s name and Kingdom! May we continue to share the life-giving truth from God’s Word with as many people as possible.—Matt. 28: 19, 20.</span></p></li></ul>

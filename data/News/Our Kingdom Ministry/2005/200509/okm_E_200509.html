<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">September 2005 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United States of America </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">km-E</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Us 9/05 Vol. 48, No. 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">With the start of the new service year, there are 9 new circuits in the United States branch territory, making a total of 41 new circuits in the last five years. Of these, 22 are Spanish, 11 are English, and 8 are other languages. The United States branch territory now comprises 580 circuits and 45 districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Outstanding work is being done to spread the good news in Bermuda and the Turks and Caicos islands, which are part of the United States branch territory. The 679 publishers serving on these islands conduct an average of 536 Bible studies each month, and their Memorial attendance of 1,385 was more than twice the number of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At Wallkill, visitors have been coming in record numbers to see the completed printery addition. After visiting for the first time, one older sister said: “This tour was awe-inspiring! I have so much to tell the brothers back home. If Jehovah is willing, I plan to come back every year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The printery expansion and other Bethel construction projects were accomplished, thanks to the help of more than 1,500 Regional Building Committee volunteers. A brother overseeing the construction work stated: “The willingness of those invited has been encouraging, and their experience has been a</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Our desire to please Jehovah moves us to center our lives on spiritual activities. His Word instructs us to ‘keep on seeking first the kingdom’ and to “make sure of the more important things.” (Matt. 6:33; Phil. 1:10) How can we buy out time for Kingdom interests and keep less important activities in their place?—Eph. 5:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Put Kingdom Activities First: </span><span class="font12">Schedule your time so that it is not wasted on nonessentials. Some start each month by blocking out specific times on their calendar for the field ministry. Then they are careful not to allow other matters to interfere with those plans. The same can be done to buy out time for meetings, personal study, and conventions. Many have a daily plan that begins or ends with Bible reading. Set aside a specific time for each important activity, and do not let other things needtremendous asset. We sincerely appreciate their help.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">We would also like to express our gratitude to the many thousands of brothers and sisters who came from 45 states to assist those whose homes were damaged or destroyed by the hurricanes that struck Florida. How privileged we are to be part of a loving Christian brotherhood! —1 Pet. 2:17. lessly interfere.—Eccl. 3:1; 1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Limit Use of the World: </span><span class="font12">In some lands, sports, entertainment, recreation, hobbies, and other pursuits are readily available. Many spend an inordinate amount of time watching television or using computers. However, becoming preoccupied with leisure activities and new gadgets that this world has to offer will inevitably lead to disappointment. (1 John 2:15-17) Hence, the Scriptures urge us not to use the world to the full. (1 Cor. 7:31) By heeding that wise counsel, you can show Jehovah that his worship occupies first place in your life.—Matt. 6:19-21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> The time left for this present system is about to run out. Those who put Kingdom interests first will be happy and will gain God’s favor. (Prov. 8:32-35; Jas. 1:25) May we, therefore, make wise use of this valuable resource, our time.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">All this zealous activity in advancing Kingdom interests is commendable! Your generous financial support of the work is also very much appreciated. (Prov. 3:9, 10) May Jehovah continue to bless our united efforts to “serve for the praise of his glory.”—Eph. 1:12.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Conducting Progressive Bible Studies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This insert is a compilation of key points from the series of articles on conducting progressive Bible studies that has appeared in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> All are encouraged to save this insert and to consult it when conducting Bible studies. In addition, points from this insert may be highlighted during meetings for field service, and service overseers may use it as the basis for talks they present when visiting book study groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parti: What Is a Bible Study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">If you regularly and systematically have Bible discussions, though brief, using the Bible or along with it one of the recommended publications, you are conducting a Bible study. The study may be reported when it has been conducted two times after the study arrangement is demonstrated and if there is reason to believe that the study will continue—km 7/04 p. 1.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Recommended Publications</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">■ What Does God Require of Us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">■ Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">■ Worship the Only True God</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">■ You Can Be God’s Friend!</span><span class="font5"> may be used to study with people who have limited education or reading ability.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 2: Preparing to Conduct the Study</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">We need to present the information in a way that touches the student’s heart. This requires thorough preparation with the student in mind.—km 8/04 p. 1.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>How to Prepare</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">■ Examine the title, subheadings, and visual aids of the chapter or lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Identify the answers to the printed questions, marking only key words and phrases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Decide which cited scriptures to read during the study. Make brief notes in the margin of the study publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Prepare a brief review of main points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Personalize the Lesson</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Pray about the student and his needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Anticipate points that the student may have difficulty understanding or accepting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Consider: What does he need to understand or work on in order to make spiritual progress? How can I reach his heart?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ As needed, prepare an illustration, an explanation, or a series of questions to help the student grasp a point or a scripture.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 3: Effective Use of the Scriptures</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our purpose in conducting Bible studies is to “make disciples” by helping people to understand and accept the teachings of God’s Word and apply them in their lives. (Matt. 28:19, 20; 1 Thess. 2:13) Therefore, the study should center on the Scriptures.—km 11/04 p. 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Teach From God’s Word</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Show the student how to find specific texts in his own copy of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Look up and discuss Bible texts that show the Scriptural basis for our beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Use questions. Instead of explaining Bible texts to the student, have him explain them to you.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Keep it simple. Do not try to explain every aspect of a scripture. Include </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font5"> what is needed to make the point clear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Make practical application. Help the student to see how Bible texts apply to him personally.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 4: Training Students to Prepare</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A student who reads the lesson beforehand, marks the answers, and thinks of how to express them in his own words makes rapid spiritual progress. Therefore, once a regular study has been established, prepare a lesson together to show the student how. With most students, it will be helpful to prepare an entire chapter or lesson together.—km 12/04 p. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Markingsand Notations</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Explain how to find direct answers to the printed questions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Show the student your copy of the study publication in which you have marked only the key words or phrases.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Help the student to see that each cited text supports a point in the paragraph, and show him how to make brief notations in the margin of his study publication.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Survey and Review</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Show the student how to examine the chapter or lesson title, subheadings, and illustrations before beginning his detailed preparation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Encourage the student to review the main points at the conclusion of the preparation session.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 5: Determining How Much Material to Cover</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The amount of material that can be considered will depend on the ability and the circumstances of both the teacher and the student.—km 1/05 p. 1.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Build Solid Faith</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Do not sacrifice the student’s having a clear understanding of God’s Word for the sake of speed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Spend whatever time is necessary to help the student understand and accept what he is learning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Allow sufficient time to consider key scriptures that provide the basis for the teachings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep the Study Moving</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">■ If the student is inclined to speak at length about personal matters, you may need to arrange to discuss these after the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Do not talk excessively during the study. Limit the discussion of side points and experiences so as not to hinder the student from acquiring an accurate knowledge of basic Bible teachings.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 6: When a Student Raises a Question</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Once a Bible study is well-established, it is usually best to consider Bible teachings in an orderly manner rather than jump from subject to subject. This helps the student to build a foundation of accurate knowledge and to progress spiritually.—km 2/05 p. 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Discerning</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Questions related to the study material can usually be answered on the spot.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Questions unrelated to the study material or that require research can be considered at another time. It may be helpful to write down such questions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">■ If the student has difficulty accepting a certain teaching, consider additional material that thoroughly discusses the subject.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">■ If the student is still not convinced, leave the subject for another time and continue with the study.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Be Modest</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">■ If you do not know the answer to a question, do not venture an opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Progressively teach the student how to do research.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 7: Offering Prayer at the Study</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In order for Bible students to make spiritual progress, Jehovah’s blessing is essential. Therefore, it is proper to open and close an established study with prayer—km 3/05 p. 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Introduce Prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ With those who are religiously inclined, prayer can often be offered from the very first study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ With others, we need to discern the appropriate time to introduce prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Psalm 25:4, 5 and 1 John 5:14 can be used to explain why prayer is offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ John 15:16 can be used to show that we should pray to Jehovah through Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Include in Prayers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ It is fitting to praise Jehovah as the Source of instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Express sincere interest in the student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Express appreciation for the organization that Jehovah is using.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Request Jehovah’s blessing on the student’s efforts to apply what he is learning.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 8: Directing Students to the Organization</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our goal in conducting Bible studies is not only to teach doctrinal information but also to help students become part of the Christian congregation. Take a few minutes each week on the study to share a point about Jehovah’s organization.—km 4/05 p. 8.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Congregation Meetings</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">■ Describe each congregation meeting. From the first study, invite them to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Share outstanding points that were presented at the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Build enthusiasm for the Memorial, assemblies, and the visit of the circuit overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Use photographs in our publications to help them visualize what takes place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Encourage them to read the brochure </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Videos to Build Appreciation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">■ Jehovah’s Witnesses—The Organization Behind the Name</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">■ Our Whole Association of Brothers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">■ United by Divine Teaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">■ To the Ends of the Earth</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 9: Preparing Students to Witness Informally</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">As </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bible students begin to exercise faith in what they are learning, they are impelled to speak about it.—km 5/05 p. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Encourage Them to Witness</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Are there friends and family members whom they could invite to sit in on the study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Have any of their workmates, schoolmates, or other acquaintances expressed interest?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Train Them to Share Their Beliefs</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ At selected points during the study, ask the student, “How would you use the Bible to explain this truth to your family?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Help the student appreciate the need to be respectful and kind when speaking with others about God and his purposes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 10: Training Students in the House-to-House Ministry</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">When the elders determine that a Bible student qualifies as an unbaptized publisher, he may begin to share with the congregation in the public preaching work.—km 6/05 p. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Preparing Together</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Show the new publisher where he can find suggested presentations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Help him select a simple approach that is practical for the local territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Encourage him to feature the Bible in his ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Rehearse together. Show him how to handle common responses tactfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Preaching Together</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Let the student observe as you give the presentation that you prepared together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Take into consideration the personality and abilities of the student. In some cases, it may be best to have him give only part of the presentation.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 11: Helping Students to Make Return Visits</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation for a return visit begins with the initial call. Encourage the student to take a sincere interest in those with whom he speaks. Progressively train him to draw them out, to listen to their comments, and to note the things that concern them.—km 7/05 p. 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 12: Helping Students Start and Conduct Bible Studies</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Your imitating Jesus by setting a proper example in your own ministry is vital. As your student observes your lead in the ministry, he will appreciate that the objective in making return visits is to start Bible studies.—km 8/05 p. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Offering a Bible Study</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">■ Explain to the student that it is not generally necessary to describe the study arrangement in detail.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Building One Another Up</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul did all that he could to strengthen fellow believers. (Acts 14:1922) Likewise, we are concerned when our brothers face difficult situations, and we want to help them. The Bible indicates that all, not just elders, should take an interest in others. (Rom. 15:1, 2) Consider two ways in which we can heed the loving admonition: “Keep comforting one another and building one another up.”—1 Thess. 5:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Discern Others’ Needs: </span><span class="font12">God’s Word reports that Dorcas “abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy.” (Acts 9: 36, 39) She took note of those who were in need and did what she could to help them. What a fine example she set for us! You may learn that an older one needs a ride to the meeting. Or there may be a pioneer who has no one to work with in service on a weekday afternoon. If you discern such a need and offer practical assistance, imagine how that one will be encouraged!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Spiritual Conversations: </span><span class="font12">We can also build others up by our speech. (Eph. 4:29) An experienced elder observed: “If you want to be encouraging, talk about spiritual things. To start an upbuilding conversation, you might use a simple question, such as, ‘How did you learn the truth?’ ” Show a sincere interest in the young people in the congregation. Reach out to those who are discouraged and those who may be shy. (Prov. 12:25) Do not allow discussing the world’s entertainment to crowd out good spiritual discussions with fellow believers.—Rom. 1:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> What, though, can you say to build others up? In your personal Bible reading and study, did you recently find a principle that deepened your appreciation for Jehovah? Were you moved by something you heard in a public talk or at a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> Study? Or was your heart touched by a faithstrengthening experience? If you treasure up such spiritual gems, you will always have something encouraging to share with others.—Prov. 2:1; Luke 6:45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> By offering practical assistance and making wise use of our tongue, may we keep building one another up. —Prov. 12:18.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Help Others to Become “Obedient From the Heart”</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Obedience is fundamental to worshipping Jehovah acceptably. (Deut. 12:28; 1 Pet. 1:14-16) Soon, God’s judgment will come upon “those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news.” (2 Thess. 1:8) How can we help others to become “obedient from the heart” to the teachings of God’s Word? —Rom. 6:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> By Helping to Build Faith and Love: </span><span class="font12">In the Scriptures, obedience is closely associated with faith. The apostle Paul spoke of “the command of the everlasting God to promote </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">obedience by faith.”</span><span class="font12"> (Rom. 16:26) Hebrews chapter 11 cites numerous examples of faith, many of which involved acting in harmony with Jehovah’s expressed will. (Heb. 11:7,8,17) On the other hand, disobedience is associated with lack of faith. (John 3: 36; Heb. 3:18, 19) We need to develop skill in the use of God’s Word in order to help others develop the kind of faith that produces obedience.—2 Tim. 2:15; Jas. 2:14, 17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">’Obedience is also linked with love for God. (Deut. 5:10; 11:1, 22; 30:16) “This is what the love of God means,” says 1 John 5:3, “that we </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">observe his commandments;</span><span class="font12"> and yet his commandments are not burdensome.” How can we help Bible students to develop love for Jehovah? Look for opportunities during the study to build appreciation for Jehovah’s qualities.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. What does Jehovah require of his worshippers?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. Why is it important to help others build strong faith?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. (a) How is obedience linked with love? (b) How can we help Bible students to develop love for Jehovah?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">Express your own deep feelings for God. Help the student think in terms of developing a personal relationship with Jehovah. More than anything else, love for Jehovah will motivate others—as well as ourselves—to obey him from the heart.—Matt. 22:37.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> By Our Example: </span><span class="font12">A powerful means by which we can encourage others to obey the good news is by our example. However, constant effort is required on our part to cultivate “an obedient heart.” (1 Ki. 3:9; Prov. 4: 23) What does this involve? Nourish your heart through regular Bible study and meeting attendance. (Ps. 1:1, 2; Heb. 10:24, 25) Seek association with those whose hearts are unified in true worship. (Prov. 13:20) Share regularly in the field ministry, with a sincere desire to help people in your territory. Pray for Jehovah’s help to guide the development of a good heart. (Ps. 86:11) Avoid things that can corrupt your heart, such as immoral or violent entertainment. Pursue things that bring you closer to God and that strengthen your relationship with him.—Jas. 4: 7, 8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah assured his ancient people that blessings would overtake them if they listened to his voice. (Deut. 28:1, 2) Likewise today, Jehovah is richly blessing “those obeying him as ruler.” (Acts 5:32) By our teaching and example, therefore, may we help others to become obedient from the heart.</span></p>

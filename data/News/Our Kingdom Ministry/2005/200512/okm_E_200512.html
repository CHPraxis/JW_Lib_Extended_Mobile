<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Education That Leads to Life</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">■How rewarding it is to see people’s eyes light up as they come to understand the truth from God’s Word! Sharing with others the knowledge of God and his purpose for mankind truly is satisfying. Such education can lead a person to everlasting life.—John 17:3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Why Superior: </span><span class="font9">Education is offered today by almost every means possible and on every subject imaginable. (Eccl. 12: 12) But such knowledge cannot compare in value to “the magnificent things of God.” (Acts 2:11) Has the education offered in the world been able to draw mankind any closer to the Creator and to knowing his purpose? Has it helped people to understand what happens when we die or why there is so much suffering? Has it given people hope? Has it helped to improve the family arrangement? No. Only through divine education can we find real answers to life’s most important questions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’Divine education provides something that is sorely lacking in today’s world—moral development. God’s Word uproots racism, tribalism, and nationalism from the hearts of those who accept and apply its teachings. (Heb. 4:12) It has moved people to renounce every kind of violence and to ‘clothe themselves with the new personality.’ (Col. 3:9-11; Mic. 4:1-3) Moreover, divine education has given millions the strength to overcome deeply embedded practices and traits that displease God—1 Cor. 6:9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup>Why Urgent Now: </span><span class="font9">Our Grand Instructor alerts us to the meaning of the times in which we live. His prophetic judgments contain up-to-date information that must be proclaimed earth wide. (Rev. 14:6, 7) Christ is ruling in the heavens, the world empire of false religion will soon be devastated, and God’s Kingdom is poised to destroy all earthly governments. (Dan. 2:44; Rev. 11:15; 17:16) Hence, it is urgent for people to recognize God’s nowreigning King, to get out of Babylon the Great, and to call upon the name of Jehovah in faith. (Ps. 2:11, 12; Rom. 10:13; Rev. 18:4) May we have the fullest share possible in imparting to others the education that leads to life.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Personal Interest —By Being Adaptable</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">’The apostle Paul set a fine example in always adapting his presentation of the good news to the background and thinking of his audience. (1 Cor. 9:1923) We should endeavor to do the same. With a little forethought, we can often tailor the sample presentations that appear in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> to fit the needs of the people in our territory. As we approach a door, we may notice indications of the householder’s interests and incorporate these into our presentation. However, there is yet another way that we can be adaptable in our ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Build on What Others Say: </span><span class="font9">When presenting the good news, we frequently pose a question and invite householders to respond. How do you view the response? Are you inclined to offer a token acknowledgment and just continue with your prepared presentation? Or does what you say reflect that you are taking into consideration the householders’ comments? If you show a sincere interest in what others say, you may be able to use additional tactful questions to find out what is really on their mind. (Prov. 20:5) Thus you can focus on aspects of the Kingdom message that most directly address the listener’s concerns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> This requires that we be willing to talk about subjects other than those we had originally planned to discuss. If we begin by commenting on a problem that is in the news and the householder mentions a local or personal issue that concerns him, our genuine interest in meeting the needs of the householder will move us to center the Bible discussion on what matters most to him.—Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Tailoring Our Approach: </span><span class="font9">When the householder raises a question, we might find it beneficial to continue the discussion at a later time after we have been able to look up additional information on the subject. We can also offer publications that provide a more thorough consideration of the topic. All of this reflects our sincere interest in helping others come to know Jehovah.—2 Cor. 2:17.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> King Hezekiah of ancient Judah used runners to hand deliver letters summoning the people to assemble together in Jerusalem. (2 Chron. 30:6, 13) The response of the people revealed their attitude toward true worship. (2 Chron. 30:10-12) In the coming months, servants of Jehovah today will have a similar opportunity to demonstrate their heartfelt appreciation for the privilege of gathering together to worship Jehovah. A letter has been delivered to your congregation inviting you to attend the “Deliverance at Hand” District Convention. How will you respond to that invitation?</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Program Times</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Make Arrangements Now: </span><span class="font9">To benefit fully from the spiritual program that is being lovingly prepared, we need to be present for the entire program. Wisely start now to make whatever arrangements are needed for you and your family to attend all three days. (Prov. 21:5) Such preparations may include asking your employer for time off, discussing your plans with a nonWitness mate, making hotel reservations, and assisting Bible students to be in attendance each day. Do not leave these important matters to the last minute. Rather, make them a matter of prayer to Jehovah, trusting that “he himself will act.”—Ps. 37:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah’s organization has gone to great lengths to ensure that sufficient accommodations are available in each convention city.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. How did God’s people demonstrate their appreciation for true worship in ancient times, and what similar opportunity do we have today?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. What can we do now so as to benefit fully from the convention?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Why should we cooperate with the arrangements that have been made for our accommodations?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Appreciation for the self-sacrificing efforts of the hardworking brothers who assisted in making these arrangements, consideration for our fellow convention delegates, and respect for theocratic order should move us to cooperate fully with the guidelines provided in this article.—1 Cor. 13:5; 1 Thess. 5:12, 13; Heb. 13:17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Hotel Reservations: </span><span class="font9">A Recommended Lodging List of available hotels will be posted on the information board after this article is considered at the Service Meeting. Using the instructions in the box on page 4, please reserve rooms </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font9"> at hotels on the list and agree to pay </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font9"> the rates shown. Please do not call hotels that are not</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">on the list and ask if they have a rate for your convention. Such hotels will often say that they have a rate for Jehovah’s Witnesses. Your cooperation will help toward the goal of obtaining high-quality hotels near the convention site at the best rates possible each year.—1 Cor. 14:40.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> It is important to reserve only the hotel rooms you will actually use during the convention. Unless you have agreed to do so beforehand and submit definite names, please do not reserve rooms for other delegates. This artificially inflates the number of rooms reserved for the convention and makes it harder for other delegates to make a reservation. Each room should be reserved in the name of one of the persons who will occupy it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> To guarantee your reservation, you must make a deposit to the hotel for each room reserved. Otherwise, the hotel can offer your room to someone else. If no rooms are</span></p></li></ul>

Please wait for a revised list to be received for your convention rather than calling a hotel not on the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> Special Needs: </span><span class="font9">Proverbs 3:27 says: “Do not hold back good from those to whom it is owing, when it happens to be in the power of your hand to do it.” How can you do good to others in connection with the convention?

(1 Tim. 5:4) If they cannot do so, fellow believers may be able to help. (Gal. 6: 10) Book study overseers should check with those in their group who have special needs to be sure that their plans are in order well in advance of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">* Special Needs Room Request</span><span class="font9"> forms are available </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font9"> for publishers whose accommodation </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">needs</span><span class="font9"> cannot be cared for by family members or by their congregation. The Congregation Service Committee should consider the publisher’s qualifications, using the guidelines on the form as well as the letter dated December 14, 2005, addressed to all bodies of elders.

It is truly as the psalmist sang: “A day in your courtyards is better than a thousand elsewhere.” (Ps. 84: 10) David expressed in song his desire to ‘dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of his life so as to look with appreciation upon Jehovah’s temple.’ (Ps. 27:4) It pleased David greatly to be among Jehovah’s worshippers. May we imitate his appreciation for true worship by being in attendance for all three days of the “Deliverance at Hand” District Convention.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Could Your Child Make a Mature Decision?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup>A mature decision about what? Blood transfusions. As shown in the article entitled “Walk as Instructed by Jehovah” in the June 15, 1991, issue of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font0"> children of Jehovah’s Witnesses have had to take a mature stand to prove that their desire to obey God’s law on blood is as important to them as it is to their parents. Could that also be required of your minor child?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> What Does the Law Say? </span><span class="font0">In the United States, the highest court that has ruled on a mature minor’s right to refuse blood transfusions is the Illinois Supreme Court. In reviewing the case of a 17-year-old sister, the court decreed: “If the evidence is clear and convincing that the minor is mature enough to appreciate the consequences of her actions [and] to exercise the judgment of an adult, then the mature minor doctrine affords her the common law right to consent to or refuse medical treatment.” Thus, in assessing whether a child is mature enough to make his own decision, doctors or officials may interview the patient to hear him express his personal objection to taking blood. The youth would need to understand reasonably the gravity of his medical condition and the consequences of his options for treatment and clearly and firmly express his own religious belief about God’s law on blood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> What Would Your Child Say? </span><span class="font0">Are your children able to express themselves on this issue? Do they believe with all</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. What stand have Witness youths taken regarding the use of blood? Give an example.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. What legal standard did one court apply to a minor who refused blood transfusions, and what do Christian parents and their minor children learn from this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. What questions should parents seriously consider, and why?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">their heart that it is a divine command to ‘abstain from blood’? (Acts 15:29; 21:25) Can they explain their belief from the Scriptures? Would they courageously defend their firm decision about blood if doctors believed that their life was in jeopardy, even if their parents were not present? Since “time and unforeseen occurrence befall [us] all,” how can you prepare your children for any unexpected challenge to their integrity?—Eccl. 9:11; Eph. 6:4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Parents, What Can You Do? </span><span class="font0">You have the responsibility to teach your children God’s view of blood. (2 Tim. 3:14, 15) A clear explanation is found in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font0"> book, pages 70-4. Study it carefully with your family. Using the feature “If Someone Says—” on pages 74-6, conduct practice sessions with your children to help them gain experience in explaining what they believe and why. (1 Pet. 3:15) Other provisions for educating us about the blood issue include the brochure </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">How Can Blood Save Your Life?</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> of June 15, 2004, pages 14-24. In addition, the video programs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">TransfusionAlternative Health Care—Meeting Patient Needs and Rights</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">No Blood—Medicine Meets the Challenge,</span><span class="font0"> which are currently available on the DVD entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Transfusion Alternatives—Documentary Series,</span><span class="font0"> give convincing information about the reasonableness and effectiveness of bloodless medicine and surgery.

<p><span class="font9">■ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed on the following dates: March 11, 2006 (Gilead graduation); May 12-13, 2006 (spring cleaning); September 9, 2006 (Gilead graduation); and October 7, 2006 (annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania). There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on those dates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ The Memorial invitations for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2006 </span><span class="font9">in the primary language of each congregation will soon be sent.

A listing of the languages in which Memorial invitations are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed each month. Please request only those languages needed for your territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Please note that the Memorial for the year </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2007 </span><span class="font9">will be on Monday, April 2, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. In such instances, the elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances from other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ Because of the importance of the Memorial, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders to be the speaker instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother every year. If there is an elder of the anointed who is well qualified to give the talk, he should be selected.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A School That Helps Us Make Practical Application</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> As we consider the material listed in the Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 2006, we strive to benefit from Scriptural teachings by relating them to our sacred service and everyday life. We make it a point to practice the things we learn.—John 13:17; Phil. 4:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Offering Comments: </span><span class="font9">The schedule for this year allocates an additional minute to audience participation in Bible highlights. This means that the brother assigned to present the highlights should be careful to complete his portion in five minutes instead of six. Those offering comments from their seats should also be mindful of their timing. With careful forethought, the one commenting can express helpful information in 30 seconds or less. Approximately ten individuals should be able to make meaningful comments during the five minutes allotted for audience participation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Talks That Teach: </span><span class="font9">The Bible highlights and the instruction talk should focus on the value of the material as it applies to our ministry and other aspects of our daily lives. A speaker should do more than simply awaken in his listeners a desire to act. He should specify what action is needed, show how it can be accomplished, and draw attention to the benefits of taking such action. It should be possible to say, “This is how this text provides guidance for us,” or “This is how we might use these verses in the ministry.” Elders and ministerial servants who are aware of local circumstances should strive to make the practical application of the material as specific as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>4</sup> Citing Biblical examples can be particularly effective in making practical application. After referring to a Scriptural example, a speaker could say, “You too may find yourself in a situation similar to this.” He should make sure that any application of the Biblical example is in harmony with the context, with the Bible as a whole, and with what has been published by “the faithful and discreet slave.”—Matt. 24:45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Wisdom is the ability to use knowledge and understanding successfully. “Wisdom is the prime thing.” (Prov. 4:7) As we go on acquiring practical wisdom through our studies in the Theocratic Ministry School, may we also hone the art of imparting it to others.</span></p></li></ul>

<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>1</sup> “I have been reading your publications since 1965. I refer to the Bible when reading, and everything in your literature corresponds to the Bible. I’ve always wanted to know the real truth about God and Jesus, and I honestly can say that I am finding true answers through your material and the Bible.” That is what one man wrote to the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses. In the same letter, he requested a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> Like that grateful man, millions of people worldwide appreciate the Bible study aids provided by “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Matt. 24: 45) Each year, a tremendous amount of literature is produced to help honesthearted people “come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) How can we make wise use of our Bible-based literature?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Avoid Waste: </span><span class="font9">Over a period of time, we could accumulate more literature than we will actually use. What can we do to avoid wasting our valuable publications? Discernment is needed when picking up literature for use in the ministry. Rather than obtaining many copies of a publication that we will be offering, we might pick up just one or two copies and return for more after those are placed. This would prevent a</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">3. How can we avoid wasting literature? large supply of literature from accumulating in our homes. Similarly, if we have a large number of unplaced magazines, it would be appropriate to reduce the number that we request.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Overstocked Items: </span><span class="font9">If the congregation is overstocked with certain publications, the literature coordinator may wish to check with other congregations in the area to see if they can use the extra literature. Publishers can offer older publications to unbelieving family members, Bible students, and others. Those who are newly associated with the congregation may appreciate having these older publications for their personal theocratic library.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> We want our literature to achieve its intended purpose, namely, to help sincere people learn more about Jehovah’s marvelous purposes. Just as Jesus did not waste leftover food after he miraculously fed the crowds, our goal should be to make the best use of the valuable Bible-based literature that is provided. (John 6: 11-13) The lifesaving message contained in our publications cannot touch the hearts of righteously inclined people if it remains on our shelves or in our book bags. Therefore, we must be reasonable when picking up literature for the ministry and make wise use of it to benefit others.—Phil. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>

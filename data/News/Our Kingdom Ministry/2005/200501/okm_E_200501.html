<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Nourished With the Words of the Faith”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">’Pursuing a life of godly devotion requires strenuous effort. (1 Tim. 4:7-10) In our own strength, we would soon grow weary and stumble in trying to follow such a course. (Isa. 40:29-31) One way we can draw strength from Jehovah is by being “nourished with the words of the faith.” —1 Tim. 4:6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Rich Spiritual Food: </span><span class="font12">Through his Word and through “the faithful and discreet slave,” Jehovah provides rich spiritual food. (Matt. 24:45) Are we doing war part to benefit from it? Do we read the Bible each day? Do we have set times for personal study and meditation? (Ps. 1: 2, 3) Such a healthy spiritual diet invigorates us and protects us from the weakening effects of Satan’s world. (1 John 5:19) If we fill our mind with wholesome things and apply them in our lives, Jehovah will be with us.—Phil. 4:8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah also strengthens us by means of congregation meetings. (Heb. 10:24, 25) The spiritual instruction and wholesome association found at these gatherings fortify us to stand firm in the face of trials. (1 Pet. 5:9,10) One Christian youth said: “I go to school all day long, and it tears me down. But the meetings are like an oasis in the desert, where I am refreshed to make it through the next school day.” How we are blessed for the effort we put forth to attend meetings!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Proclaiming the Truth: </span><span class="font12">Preaching to others was like food to Jesus. It energized him. (John 4:32-34) Likewise, when we talk to others about the marvelous promises of God, we feel rejuvenated. Being busy in the ministry also keeps our heart and mind focused on the Kingdom and the blessings soon to come. That truly refreshes us. —Matt. 11:28-30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> How privileged we are to benefit from the rich spiritual nourishment that Jehovah is providing for his people today! May we continue crying out joyfully to his praise.—Isa. 65:13,14.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Conducting Progressive Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 5: Determining How Much Material to Cover</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When teaching, Jesus took into consideration his disciples’ limitations, speaking to them “as far as they were able to listen.” (Mark 4:33; John 16: 12) In a similar way, teachers of God’s Word today need to gauge the pace at which they cover material on a Bible study. The amount of material that can be considered will depend on the ability and the circumstances of both the teacher and the student.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Build Solid Faith: </span><span class="font12">Some students may require two or three sessions to grasp what other students can easily take in during one session. We do not want to sacrifice the student’s having a clear understanding for the sake of speed. Every student needs a solid basis for his newfound faith in God’s Word.—Prov. 4:7; Rom. 12:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> As you conduct the study week by week, spend whatever time is necessary to help the student understand and accept what he is learning from God’s Word. Avoid a hurried pace that detracts from the richness of the truths being taught. Allow sufficient time to focus on the main points and to consider key scriptures that provide the basis for the teachings.—2 Tim. 3:16, 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Keep the Study Moving: </span><span class="font12">While we want to avoid rushing through the study, we also want to avoid becoming sidetracked. If a student is inclined to speak at length about personal matters, we may need to arrange to discuss these after the study. —Eccl. 3:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> On the other hand, our own enthusiasm for the truth can make it a challenge not to talk excessively during the study. (Ps. 145:6, 7) An occasional side point or experience can enrich a study, but we would not want these to become so numerous or lengthy that they hinder the student from acquiring an accurate knowledge of basic Bible teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> By covering a reasonable amount of material at each study session, we help Bible students to “walk in the light of Jehovah.”—Isa. 2:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Where can we find the best advice on how to solve our most perplexing problems? [Allow for response.

[Cite an example known locally.] Did you know that such things are part of a global sign that shows that God’s government is soon to take control of earth’s affairs? [Allow for response. Then read an appropriate scripture text, such as Matthew 24:3, 7, 8; Luke 21:7,10,11; or 2 Timothy 3:1-5.] This brochure discusses why it is especially urgent to be alert to the significance of these events now.”</span></p>

The Bible assures us that God will soon act to relieve mankind’s suffering. [Read Revelation 14:6, 7.] Notice what God’s judgment will mean for mankind.

This book is designed to help them to do that.” Highlight the pictures and captions in chapter 15 or 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Often parents are amazed at the questions their children ask. Some of those questions can be hard to answer, isn’t that so? [Allow for response. Then read Ephesians 6:4.] This book can help parents answer questions for their children today.” Highlight a few of the pictures and captions in chapters 11 and 12 or 34 to 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life—How Did it Get Here ? By Evolution or by Creation ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Open to page 6, and say: “Many people think that our beautiful earth and life upon it resulted from an accident. What do you consider to be a reasonable explanation as to how all of this came about? [Allow for response.] Mountains of evidence confirm the Bible’s account of a Creator who is very powerful and who loves us very much. He is the true God, and his name is Jehovah.” Read Psalm 83: 18, and briefly explain how it is his purpose to transform the entire earth into a paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mankind’s Search for God</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“With so many different religions today, have you ever wondered how we can determine which one is approved by God?” After a response, open to page 377. Highlight point number 7, and ask if the householder agrees that the true religion should unite all races of mankind. Look up one of the cited scriptures, and as time permits, discuss some of the other points on the list. If there is genuine interest, offer the book. When leaving, you could ask, “How should true religion affect a person’s conduct?” Arrange for a return visit to answer the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If a person identifies himself as a member of a major religious group, you might say: “It is interesting to meet people of various religions. Mankind’s search for God has taken many different directions. [If appropriate, read Acts 17: 26, 27.] Often, people follow the religion of their parents. [Read paragraph 12 on page 8.] Learning more about other religions is enlightening and educational. This book explains the origin, practices, and teachings of the major religions of the world.” Show an example of what the book contains about the person’s religion, as found on the following pages: Sikhism (100-101); Hinduism (116-17); Buddhism (141); Taoism (164-6); Confucianism (177); Shintoism (190-5); Judaism (220-1); and Islam (289).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“You may have heard about [mention a news item]. When lives are tragically cut short, many wonder what comfort can be offered to the families of the victims. What do you think?” Allow for response. Then open to page 299, and show the resurrection scene that is illustrated. Continue by saying: “Many are surprised to learn that both righteous and unrighteous people will be brought back to life in Paradise on earth. [Read Acts 24:15 as quoted in paragraph 9 on page 297, and then give the explanation found in paragraph 10.] This book discusses many other interesting details about God’s purpose for the future.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“We live at a time when almost everyone is faced with serious problems. Many turn to all sorts of counselors for guidance. Some look to psychics for help. Where do you think we can find sound counsel that will really work for us? [Allow for response.] The Bible states an important fact that all of us need to appreciate. [Read 2 Timothy 3:16. Then open to page 187, and read paragraph 9.] This book will help you to appreciate how following what the Bible says always works out for the best.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived</span></p>

How do you feel about that?” Allow for a reply. Turn to chapter 24, and discuss briefly why Jesus came to earth. Then read John 15:13, emphasizing Jesus’ heartfelt love for others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“When someone mentions Jesus Christ, many people think of him either as a baby or as a suffering man about to die. Their concept of Jesus involves only his birth and his death. The marvelous things he said and did during his lifetime often go unnoticed. What he accomplished affects every person who has ever lived on this earth. That’s why it’s vital that we learn as much as we can about the wonderful things he did in our behalf.” Read John 17:3. Turn to the first page of the introduction, and read the fourth paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?</span></p>

Then read Matthew 6:10.] Have you given thought to just what the Kingdom of God really is?” Turn to lesson 6, and read the questions that are posed at the beginning of the lesson. Begin a discussion of the lesson, or arrange to do so on the next visit.</span></p>

Do you know what Jesus will do for the sick, the elderly, and even the dead?” Allow for response. If the person wants to know the answer, open to lesson 5, and read the questions for paragraphs 5-6. Discuss the paragraphs, or arrange to do so on the next visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Worship the Only True God</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Where do you think we can turn for help to deal with the pressures of life? [Allow for response.

<p><span class="font13">“Since the days when Jesus walked the earth, many people have been praying for God’s Kingdom to come. Have you ever wondered what the coming of that Kingdom will mean for mankind? [Allow for response.

<p><span class="font12">Sincere interest in people will move us to try to discern their needs and show them how the Kingdom will provide the complete solution to the problems they face. (Phil. 2:4) A flexible approach that many publishers And effective is to invite the householder to comment on </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">illustrations of Paradise scenes</span><span class="font12"> in our publications, such as those listed in the righthand column of this page. You might do this using one of the following introductions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Do you think we will ever see the human family enjoying the kind of conditions pictured here?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ “All of us would like our children to be able to enjoy the kind of world pictured here. What do you think it would take to bring this about?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ “This is an illustration of what the earth will look like when God’s will takes place on earth as it is in heaven. Do you notice anything that is different from life today?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Would you like to live under the conditions pictured here? [Allow for response.] Do you think this will happen in our lifetime?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Listen carefully to the person’s response, and kindly draw him out with an additional question or two.</span><span class="font12"> If some respond that they would not want to live under the conditions pictured or that they do not believe that such a thing is possible, do not quickly conclude that they have no interest. Tactfully inquire why they feel the way they do. Their comments may reveal a deep concern over the seemingly unsolvable problems facing mankind.—Ezek. 9:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">you discern the householder’s concerns, adapt your presentation accordingly.</span><span class="font12"> Highlight the aspect of the Kingdom message that most directly addresses his needs. Share one or two scriptures that touch on the matter that concerns him. (See suggestions in the right-hand column.) Let him see for himself what God’s Word says. If he shows interest, offer the publication and arrange to call again. Continue to build on your initial conversation.</span></p>

When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Worship God</span><span class="font11"> book. The objective should be to start a home Bible study, especially with individuals who have already studied the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> book and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font11"> brochure. ■ Starting in February, and no later than March 6, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Act Wisely in a Senseless World.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">■ Congregations should make appropriate arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Thursday, March 24, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">should not begin until after sundown.</span><span class="font11"> Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. It is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial observance. However, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from the occasion. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Question Box</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ What is the best way to make contributions for the benefit of needy brothers in other lands?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">At times, we hear about brothers in another land who have come into material need because of persecution, disaster, or other difficult circumstances. Some brothers have been moved to send funds directly to the branch offices in such lands, requesting that the money be used to help a certain individual, a particular congregation, or a designated building project.—2 Cor. 8:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While such loving concern for fellow believers is commendable, often there are needs that are more urgent than those that the contributor has in mind. In some cases, the designated need has already been cared for. Of course, we can be confident that when contributions are sent to the local branch office for the worldwide work, the Kingdom Hall Fund, or disaster relief, those donated funds will be used as directed by the contributor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The brothers in all the branches have been thoroughly trained to respond quickly to unanticipated needs. In all cases, the branch keeps the Governing Body informed regarding the matter. If additional assistance is needed, the Governing Body may Invite nearby branches to help or funds may be sent directly from headquarters.—2 Cor. 8: 14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Therefore, all contributions intended for the worldwide work, building projects in other lands, or disaster relief should be sent to the branch office in the land in which you live, either through the congregation or directly. In this way, “the faithful and discreet slave,” through the organizational arrangements set in place by the Governing Body, cares for the needs of the worldwide brotherhood in an orderly manner.—Matt. 24:4547; 1 Cor. 14:33, 40.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>How to Use Sample Presentations</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Sample presentations for offering our magazines and other publications appear regularly in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font12"> When sharing in the ministry, we need not repeat these suggested presentations exactly as written. They are provided to give us an outline of what we might say. We will usually be more effective if we put the presentations in our own words. Expressing ourselves in a natural manner helps to put the householder at ease and reflects sincerity and conviction.—2 Cor. 2:17; 1 Thess. 1:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Tailor Your Presentation: </span><span class="font12">Our presentation of the good news is greatly affected by local customs. Can you exchange greetings with the householder and then weave your presentation into the conversation, or do people in your territory expect you to get right to the point? That varies from place to place and sometimes even from person to person. Discernment is also required in the use of questions. Questions that are appropriate in some places may make people feel uncomfortable in others. Hence, we must use good judgment and adapt our presentations according to what is acceptable locally.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In addition, we need to take into account the background and thinking of the people in our territory when preparing for field service. For example, you would likely discuss</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. How should we view sample presentations that are provided?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. Why do we need to consider local customs when preparing presentations?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. Why consider the background and thinking of those we speak to? Matthew 6:9, 10 with a devout Catholic differently from the way you would with a person who was unfamiliar with the “Our Father” prayer. With a little forethought, we can often tailor our presentations to make them more appealing to the people we meet in the ministry.—1 Cor. 9:20-23.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Even when we plan to use a sample presentation more or less as written, there is still no substitute for good preparation. We should carefully read the article or chapter that we plan to feature and look for points that may stir interest. Then incorporate these into our presentation. Only by being familiar with the fine information in our publications can we offer them with enthusiasm.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Other Approaches: </span><span class="font12">Are we limited to using only the approaches outlined in the sample presentations? No. If you are more comfortable with another approach or a different scripture, use it. Especially with the magazines, be alert to opportunities to feature secondary articles that may be of special interest in your territory. When field service presentations are to be demonstrated at the Service Meeting, arrangements may be made to demonstrate whatever approach works in the local territory. In this way all may be helped to present the good news effectively.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">4. Why is good preparation essential?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">5. Why might we prepare a different presentation, and how can we do so?</span></p></li></ul>

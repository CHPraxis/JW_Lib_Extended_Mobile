<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Persist in Preaching</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Critical times are here. Civil strife, ethnic wars, natural disasters, and other horrific events are commonplace. Now more than ever, the human family needs good news. However, apathy toward spiritual things is widespread. In some areas, it may be difficult to find people at home and even harder to find people who will listen to us or who want to study the Bible. Even so, it is vital that we persist in preaching the good news of God’s established Kingdom.—Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Love for People: </span><span class="font11">Our preaching underscores Jehovah’s love for people. “He does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9; Ezek. 33: 11) Hence, he has decreed that, as Jesus said, “in all the nations the good news has to be preached </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">first”</span><span class="font11"> (Mark 13:10) God appeals to people to turn to him and escape the comingjudgment on Satan’s world. (Joel 2:28, 29, 32; Zeph. 2:2, 3) Are we not grateful that Jehovah extended that opportunity to us?—1 Tim. 1:12, 13.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> The worldwide report shows that during the 2004 service year, an average of 6,085,387 Bible studies were conducted each month, and an average of some 5,000 new disciples were baptized </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">each week!</span><span class="font11"> Some of these newly dedicated ones were found as a result of Jehovah’s blessing on the persistent endeavors of publishers who made an effort to speak with everyone in their assigned territories. What joy that has produced in the congregations, and what a privilege it is to be a fellow worker with God in this lifesaving work!—1 Cor. 3:5, 6, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Praising God’s Name: </span><span class="font11">We persist in preaching in order to praise Jehovah publicly and to sanctify his name before all mankind. (Heb. 13:15) Satan has misled “the entire inhabited earth” into believing that God is powerless to solve mankind’s problems, that he is indifferent to human suffering, or that he simply does not exist. (Rev. 12:9) By our preaching, we champion the truth about our magnificent heavenly Father. May we continue to praise his name—now and forever.—Ps. 145:1, 2.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Good and Share With Others</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Dorcas “abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy.” (Acts 9:36, 39) Her generous spirit endeared her both to the people who knew her and to Jehovah God. Hebrews 13:16 says: “Do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.” How can we do good and share with others today?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> One way we can benefit others is by sharing our “valuable things.” (Prov. 3:9) Our contributions to the worldwide work make it possible for Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls, and branch facilities to be built throughout the world. Our generosity has enabled millions to benefit from theocratic instruction and upbuilding spiritual association.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Sharing Comfort: </span><span class="font11">When disaster strikes, Jehovah’s people are ready to “work what is good” toward fellow believers as well as toward those who do not share our faith. (Gal. 6: 10) Following an explosion in a chemical plant in France, one couple who lived next to the plant stated: “Our Christian brothers came immediately to help clean up our apartment as well as those of others in the building. Our neighbors were very surprised to see that so many people came to help.” Another sister added: “The elders rallied around us. They came to encourage us. In fact, this was what we needed, more than material help.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> While there are many ways that we can do good to our neighbors, the most beneficial way we can help them is to share the precious knowledge of the truth, which includes the “hope of the everlasting life” promised by Jehovah himself. (Titus 1:1, 2) The Bible’s message brings true comfort to those who are mourning over world conditions and their own sinful state. (Matt. 5:4) May we do good and share with others when it is in the power of our hand to do so. —Prov. 3:27.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Service Meeting Schedule</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Note: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font11">will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Godly Obedience” District Convention. Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to repeat counsel and reminders from this month’s insert that apply locally. A month or two following your convention, set aside 15 to 20 minutes on a Service Meeting (perhaps using a local needs portion) for a review of convention highlights that the publishers have found to be helpful in the field ministry. The special Service Meeting part will give us the opportunity to explain how we are using what we learned at the convention and how that has helped make our ministry more effective.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>All Sorts of Men Will Be Saved</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> God’s undeserved kindness has opened the way to salvation. It is Jehovah’s will that “all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) Our standing with God depends, not on our race, social standing, abilities, or outward appearance, but on our exercising faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. (John 3:16, 36) As God’s fellow workers, we must rid ourselves of any bias, which may incline our hearts to reject people whom Jehovah is willing to accept.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Avoid Judging: </span><span class="font0">Jehovah looks at what people are on the inside, without malice or partiality. (1 Sam. 16:7) He also sees them for what they can be. Thus, he views those wanting to please him as desirable. (Hag. 2:7) Do we view others as God does?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>3</sup> Some people we meet in the ministry may shock us by their appearance. They may dress shabbily or immodestly, have unkempt beards, or display nose or lip rings. Some may be homeless. Others may treat us harshly. Rather than judging such ones as never likely to become worshipers of Jehovah, we should have a positive attitude, “for even we were once senseless, disobedient, [and] being misled.” (Titus 3:3) Realizing this, we will be eager to preach to everyone, even to those who, from outward appearances, might seem unworthy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> First-Century Examples: </span><span class="font0">Jesus Christ took time to help those whom others may have dismissed as beyond hope. (Luke 8: 26-39) While never condoning wrong prac-</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">1. On what does our standing with God depend?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">2, 3. What can help us not to judge people by their outward appearance?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">4, 5. What do we learn from the examples of Jesus and Paul?</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font5">“God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.”—Acts 10:34, 35.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">tices, he knew that people could get caught up in a wrong way of life. (Luke 7:37, 38, 44-48) Thus, he showed understanding, being “moved with pity for them, because they were as sheep without a shepherd.” (Mark 6:34) Can we imitate his example more fully?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>5</sup> The apostle Paul was stoned, beaten, and imprisoned. (Acts 14:19; 16:22, 23) Did such harsh experiences cause him to become bitter and to conclude that he was wasting his time among certain nations and ethnic groups? Not at all. He knew that honesthearted individuals could be found among all ethnic groups, and he was determined to find them. Is that how we view those in our territory who are from different backgrounds and cultures?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> Welcoming Others Today: </span><span class="font0">Many of God’s people are happy that they were welcomed into the congregation by brothers and sisters who looked beyond outward appearance. A man with an unkempt beard and shoulder-length hair, dressed in dirty clothes, arrived at a Kingdom Hall in Germany. He had a bad reputation. Nevertheless, he was warmly welcomed at the meeting. He was so impressed that he returned a week later. In a short time, he cleaned up his appearance, stopped smoking, and legalized his relationship with his girlfriend. Before long, they and their children were serving Jehovah as a united family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> In imitation of our impartial God, may we extend the invitation to benefit from God’s undeserved kindness to everyone.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">6. What effect can our attitude have on new ones at congregation meetings?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11">7. How can we imitate our impartial God?</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Laud Jehovah in the Big Congregation</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> Our</span><span class="font11"> district conventions each year provide us with a marvelous opportunity to glorify Jehovah. Our feelings are as those of David, who sang: “I will laud you in the big congregation; among a numerous people I shall praise you.” (Ps. 35:18) At the upcoming “Godly Obedience” District Convention, how can we make certain that as a united people, we are a cause for praise to Jehovah?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> One way that we can do this is through our conduct. The management of one convention facility said: “Based on your conventions, we have told other religious groups wanting to rent the facility to come and see how Jehovah’s Witnesses put on a convention, as they have a perfect arrangement.” By our appearance, our cooperation, and our conduct, each of us contributes to such glowing expressions of praise, which rightly belong to our God.—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> Personal Appearance: </span><span class="font11">To dress and groom ourselves in a manner that brings praise to Jehovah requires modesty. (1 Tim. 2:9) The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font11"> book, page 132, says: “A person who is modest is concerned about not needlessly offending others and not drawing undue attention to himself.” In many lands, immodest clothing has become commonplace. However, Jehovah appreciates the effort we put forth to represent him properly. (Acts 15:14) Although the convention may be held in a sports center or recreational facility, the gathering becomes our “big congregation” during the three days of the convention. Hence, as we assemble before Jehovah, we should dress with the dignity due the highest Personage in the universe.—1 Chron. 29:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> We also need to give attention to our appearance following the closing session each day. Even though we may desire to wear more comfortable clothes during leisure time or during a meal at a restaurant, it is important that our dress and grooming still befit those</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">1, 2. With what opportunity does the district convention provide us, and in what ways can we accomplish this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3, 4. How will modesty help us to dress in a way that befits Christian ministers, both at the convention and following the sessions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“professing to reverence God.” (1 Tim. 2:10) Acceptable dress is not determined by what is popular in the world. (1 John 2:16, 17) Our Christian publications provide helpful illustrations of modest, well-arranged dress of men and women in various circumstances. Wearing our badge cards while in the convention city will serve as a reminder that we are Christian ministers at all times.—2 Cor. 6:3, 4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Respect Jehovah’s Table: </span><span class="font11">The Sovereign Lord of the universe has spread before us a feast. (Isa. 25:6; 1 Cor. 10:21) If we highly treasure our place at Jehovah’s spiritual table, our goal will be to attend all three days of the convention. Have you arranged for accommodations, transportation, and time off from secular work? Have you allotted sufficient time for preparation and travel so that you can arrive at the convention site early enough to find seats, to associate with your brothers, and to join them in giving praise to Jehovah in the opening song and prayer? —Ps. 147:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Respect for Jehovah’s table will move us to pay close attention to the program and to avoid needlessly talking with others, eating, or walking about in the corridors. Through the faithful and discreet slave class, Jehovah is providing the spiritual food that we need right now. (Matt. 24:45) None of us can afford to miss any of it. Parents should sit with their children and help them to benefit fully. —Deut. 31:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> It is requested that we bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain food during the noon break. It was commendable that most delegates carefully followed this direction at last year’s convention. How good it would be if all would do so this year! (Heb. 13:17) This arrangement provides a fine opportunity to enjoy upbuilding fellowship with our brothers and contributes to an atmosphere of unity and peace that brings honor to Jehovah.—Ps. 133:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">5, 6. How can we show respect for Jehovah’s spiritual table?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">7. What are we requested to do for the noon meal, and why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> Witnessing Informally: </span><span class="font11">While traveling to and from the convention site, we have many opportunities to praise Jehovah with our lips. (Heb. 13:15) Whether we are eating at a restaurant or conversing with hotel personnel, let us look for ways to give a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8, 9. What additional opportunity to praise Jehovah does the convention afford us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our minds and hearts will be full of spiritual treasures from the convention. Let us share these good things with those we meet informally.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> We look forward with keen anticipation to this opportunity to bless Jehovah “among the congregated throngs.” (Ps. 26:12) May we unitedly laud Jehovah at the “Godly Obedience” District Convention.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Program Times: </span><span class="font11">The program will begin at 9:30 a.m. all three days. The doors will open at 8:00 a.m. A few minutes before the start of the session, the chairman will be seated on the platform while introductory Kingdom music is played.

<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Parking: </span><span class="font11">At all convention sites where we have secured control of the parking facilities, the spaces will be made available at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. Convention badge cards will serve as identification for parking. Only those who have a state-approved disabled license plate or placard will be allowed to park in the parking reserved for the disabled. Since parking space is usually limited, carpooling should be done to the extent possible rather than having only one or two persons per car.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Seat Saving: </span><span class="font11">Seats may be saved only for those traveling with you in the same vehicle or living with you in the same home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Donations: </span><span class="font11">Considerable expense is involved in arranging a district convention. We can show our appreciation by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at our Kingdom Hall or at the convention. Any checks contributed at the convention should be made payable to “Watch Tower.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Hearing Impaired: </span><span class="font11">The program will be broadcast in the vicinity of the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. An announcement regarding this will be made at the beginning of the first session. To make use of this provision, you will need to bring a small FM receiver with earphones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Noon Meal: </span><span class="font11">Please bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers, glass containers, and alcoholic beverages are not permitted in the convention facility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Recording: </span><span class="font11">Recorders of any type should not be connected to the facility’s electric or sound system and may be used only in a way that does not disturb others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Picture Taking: </span><span class="font11">If you take pictures, no flash should be used during sessions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Pagers and Cell Phones: </span><span class="font11">These should be set so as not to cause a distraction.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Accidents and Emergencies: </span><span class="font11">Emergencyresponse services have complained that they receive many cell-phone calls to 911 over minor matters. If a medical emergency arises at the convention site, please contact a nearby attendant, who will immediately notify the First Aid Department so that our qualified first-aid personnel on site can assess the seriousness of the situation and render assistance. If necessary, 911 will be called.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Restaurants: </span><span class="font11">In many places it is customary to leave a 15 to 20 percent tip, depending on the service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Hotels: </span><span class="font11">(1) Do not reserve more rooms than will actually be needed, and do not have more people stay in your room than allowed. (2) If you must cancel your reservation, notify the hotel immediately. (3) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it. (4) Do not cook in noncooking rooms. (5) Leave a tip for the housekeeper each day. (6) Do not abuse any complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice provisions that are made available for guests to use while they are at the hotel.

<p><span class="font11">Congregations earth wide will study the brochure </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Keep on the Watch!</span><span class="font11"> during the weeks of May 23 through June 20, 2005, at the Congregation Book Study. Please use the following questions when preparing for and when conducting this meeting. During the study, read the printed material, and read the cited scriptures as time permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Week of May 23</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Pages 3-4: </span><span class="font11">Which of the situations listed here have especially affected your life? What indicates to you that these situations are not merely isolated local events?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Page 5: </span><span class="font11">What convinces you that God truly cares? What may indicate how much we care about God and what he is doing?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Pages 6-8: </span><span class="font11">What does Matthew 24:1-8, 14 say about the meaning of present world conditions? As shown by 2 Timothy 3:1-5, in what time period are we now living? Of what are these the last days? What convinces you that the Bible really is God’s Word? What is the Kingdom about which we preach?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Pages 9-10: </span><span class="font11">Why should we carefully consider our daily decisions and our priorities in life? (Rom. 2:6; Gal. 6:7) As you review the questions on page 10, what scriptures come to your mind that should have a bearing on what you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Week of May 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Page 11: </span><span class="font11">Why should we personally consider the questions raised on this page? (1 Cor. 10:12; Eph. 6:10-18) What do our answers to these questions reveal as to how seriously we take Jesus’ counsel at Matthew 24:44?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Pages 12-14: </span><span class="font11">What is “the hour of the judgment” referred to at Revelation 14: 6, 7? What is meant by ‘fearing God and giving him glory’? What is Babylon the Great, and what will become of it? What action regarding Babylon the Great do we need to take now? What else is included in the foretold hour of judgment? What effect does our not knowing “the day nor the hour” for God’s foretold execution of judgment have on us? (Matt. 25:13)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Page 15: </span><span class="font11">What is the issue of sovereignty, and how does it affect us individually?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Pages 16-19: </span><span class="font11">What are the “new heavens” and “new earth”? (2 Pet. 3:13) Who promises these things? What changes will the new heavens and new earth bring? Will we personally benefit from them?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Week of June 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Pages 20-1: </span><span class="font11">What warning about fleeing did Jesus give to his first-century followers? (Luke 21:20, 21) When was such flight possible? Why was it urgent to flee without delay? (Matt. 24:16-18, 21) Why do many people ignore warnings? How did thousands of people in China and the Philippines benefit from heeding reliable warnings? Why is it even more urgent to heed the Bible’s warning about the end of the present system of things? In view of this great urgency, we have what responsibility? (Prov. 24:11, 12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Pages 22-3: </span><span class="font11">In Australia in 1974 and in Colombia in 1985, why did many lightly brush aside warnings of disaster, and with what results? How do you think you would have reacted to these warnings, and why? What may indicate whether we would have heeded the warning in Noah’s day? Why did people want to live in and around ancient Sodom? How can we benefit by thinking seriously about what happened in Sodom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Week of June 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Pages 24-7: </span><span class="font11">Use the “Study Questions” on page 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Week of June 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Pages 28-31: </span><span class="font11">Use the “Study Questions” on page 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our consideration of the brochure will help us to “keep on the watch” and prove ourselves ready. May our public ministry always reflect the urgency of the angelic proclamation: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived.” —Matt. 24:42, 44; Rev. 14:7.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Our goal in conducting Bible studies is not only to teach doctrinal information but also to help students become part of the Christian congregation. (Zech. 8:23) The brochure </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?</span><span class="font11"> can help us to do this. Place a copy with new Bible students, and encourage them to read it. In addition, take a few minutes each week on the study to share a point about Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Congregation Meetings: </span><span class="font11">The principal way in which Bible students come to appreciate God’s organization is by associating with us at congregation meetings. (1 Cor. 14:24, 25) Therefore, you might begin getting them acquainted by describing the five weekly meetings, one meeting at a time. Mention the title of the next public talk. Show them the material that will be considered at the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> Study and at the Congregation Book Study. Describe the Theocratic Ministry School and the Service Meeting. When you have an assignment in the school, perhaps you could rehearse it with them. Share outstanding points that were presented at the meetings. Use photographs in our publications to help them visualize what takes place. From the very first study, invite them to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> When the Memorial, assem-1. Why is it beneficial to share a point about Jehovah’s organization each week on a Bible study? 2. How can you encourage Bible students to attend congregation meetings?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">3. What features of the organization might we discuss? blies, and the visit of the circuit overseer approach, take a few minutes to explain and build enthusiasm for these arrangements. Progressively answer questions such as: Why are we called Jehovah’s Witnesses? Why do we refer to our meeting places as Kingdom Halls? What are the duties of the elders and ministerial servants? How are the preaching work and the territory organized? How is our literature produced? How is the organization financed? What are the roles of the branch office and the Governing Body in overseeing the work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Instructive Videos: </span><span class="font11">Another way Bible students can see Jehovah’s marvelous organization is by means of our videos. These can take them </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">To the Ends of the Earth,</span><span class="font11"> acquaint them with </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Whole Association of Brothers,</span><span class="font11"> and show them how we are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">United by Divine Teaching.</span><span class="font11"> A woman who had received our magazines and other literature for five years was moved to tears by the video </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—The Organization Behind the Name. </span><span class="font11">She had come to trust the Witnesses that visited her, but after watching the video, she felt that she could trust the organization too. A formal study was started with her, and the following week, she attended meetings at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> By spending a few minutes each week with our students and using the tools that have been provided, we can progressively direct Bible students to the one organization that Jehovah is using today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">4, 5. How can our videos build appreciation for the organization?</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">“Isn’t there an endless amount of information available today? [Allow for response.] However, there is none more valuable than what is described in this text.

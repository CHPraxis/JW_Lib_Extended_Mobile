<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Preaching Helps Us to Endure</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> God’s Word exhorts us to “run with endurance the race that is set before us.” (Heb. 12:1) Just as a runner needs endurance to compete successfully, so we need endurance to attain the prize of everlasting life. (Heb. 10: 36) How can the Christian ministry help us to endure faithfully to the end?—Matt. 24:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Fortified Spiritually: </span><span class="font12">Our proclaiming the Bible’s marvelous promise of a righteous new world helps keep our own hope bright. (1 Thess. 5:8) When we participate regularly in the field ministry, we have the opportunity to make known the truths that we have learned from the Bible. We have the opportunity to defend our faith, which in turn helps to fortify us spiritually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In order to teach others effectively, we must clearly understand Bible truths ourselves. We have to do research and meditate on the material. The earnest effort that we put forth deepens our knowledge, strengthens our faith, and refreshes us spiritually. (Prov. 2: 3-5) Thus, as we seek to help others, we strengthen ourselves. —1 Tim. 4:15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Zealous participation in the ministry is a vital part of “the complete suit of armor from God,” which we need in order to stand firm against the Devil and the demons. (Eph. 6:10-13, 15) Our being busy in sacred service helps us to keep our mind focused on upbuilding things and to avoid becoming corrupted by Satan’s world. (Col. 3:2) As we teach others Jehovah’s ways, we are continually reminded of our own need to maintain holy conduct.—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Empowered by God: </span><span class="font12">Finally, our sharing in the evangelizing work teaches us to rely on Jehovah. (2 Cor. 4:1, 7) What a blessing that is! Our developing such trust equips us not only to accomplish our ministry but also to cope with whatever circumstances we may face in life. (Phil. 4:11-13) Indeed, learning to rely fully on Jehovah is the key to endurance. (Ps. 55:22) In many ways, preaching helps us to endure.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Part 10: Training Students in the House-to-House Ministry</span></h4></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When the elders determine that a Bible student qualifies as an unbaptized publisher, he may begin to share with the congregation in the public preaching work. (See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will,</span><span class="font12"> pp. 79-81.) How can we help the student to meet the challenge of preaching from house to house?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> Preparing Together: </span><span class="font12">There is no substitute for good preparation. Show the student where he can find suggested presentations in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book, and help him select a simple approach that is practical for the local territory. From the start, encourage him to feature the Bible in his ministry.—2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Practice sessions are very beneficial for a new publisher. As the student rehearses the presentation, show him how to handle tactfully the responses that are common in the territory. (Col. 4:6) Assure him that Christian ministers do not need to know the answer to every question that a householder might raise. Often it is best to handle such questions by offering to do research and to return to discuss the matter further. —Prov. 15:28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Preaching Together: </span><span class="font12">The first time the student shares in the house-to-house ministry, let him observe as you give the presentation that the two of you prepared together. Then get him involved. In some cases, it may be best to have the new publisher give only part of the presentation, such as reading and commenting on a scripture. Take into consideration the personality and abilities of the student. (Phil. 4:5) Be generous in giving commendation as you progressively train him in the various aspects of the preaching work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> It is important to help a new publisher establish a regular schedule for participating in the ministry, doing so weekly if possible. (Phil. 3:16) Make definite arrangements to work together in service, and encourage him to work with other zealous ones also. Their example and association will help him to develop skill and find joy in preaching from house to house.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Say About the Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">^ike Jesus’ early disciples, Christians today seek to share the good news with people wherever they can be found. (Acts 16:13; 17:17; 20:20, 21) As a result of their efforts to witness in public places, they are finding interest among people who might otherwise never have been contacted in the house-to-house ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Discernment is needed when witnessing publicly. Usually, it is best to work inconspicuously. For example, if too many publishers witness in the same area or visit the same businesses, some people may feel overwhelmed by our presence. This detracts from the dignity of our work and may limit our effectiveness. What can be done to prevent this from happening? Some congregations that have many areas for public witnessing have found it helpful to organize these into individual territories. (1 Cor. 14:40) In addition, we can contribute to good order by working only in our congregation’s assigned territory unless specific arrangements have been made through the Congregation Service Committee to assist another congregation.—See the November 1998 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> p. 6, pars. 18-19.</span></p></li>

(John 4: 7-26) This approach is also effective in certain settings today. Some publishers find that to get into the proper frame of mind for public witnessing, it is helpful to spend a few minutes greeting people and showing personal interest in them before presenting the Kingdom message. They comment on a topic of local interest, which often leads to a conversation. As others express their concerns, they listen carefully. Before long, they are sharing comfort from God’s Word.—Rom. 15:4.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> Cultivating Interest: </span><span class="font12">Each time we have a good discussion, we should try to make arrangements to cultivate the interest. How can we do this? As the discussion is coming to a close, you might take out your notebook and say: “I have enjoyed our conversation. Is there any way we can continue at another time?” Or say: “I would like you to read an article that I am sure will interest you. May I bring it to your home or office?” Some publishers simply ask: “At what number can you be reached?” This often elicits a favorable response.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Many people who were first contacted in public places have accepted Bible studies. Such studies can be conducted at the person’s home, at his place of employment, in an appropriate public setting, or by telephone. May we make it our aim to start Bible studies as we witness effectively in public places.</span></p></li></ul>

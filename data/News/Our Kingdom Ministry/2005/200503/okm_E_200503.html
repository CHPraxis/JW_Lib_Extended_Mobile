<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> On October 1,1919, the first issue of the magazine </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font12"> was published. It proved to be a most valuable tool in the preaching work. Why? Because it was specially designed for the public. That was not the case with </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> which for many years was viewed as a magazine largely for the “little flock.” (Luke 12:32) Kingdom publishers responded with such enthusiasm to the new publication that for many years the circulation of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font12">was far in excess of that of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The magazine </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font12"> was published to show people that the real solution to mankind’s problems is Christ’s Millennial Reign, which will truly usher in a golden age for humankind. In succeeding decades a number of adjustments were made to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font12"> to meet the changing needs of the times. In 1937 its name was changed to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font12"> In 1946 it became </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font12"> the name we know it by today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> From its beginning, this magazine has contributed mightily to the great witness that has been given since 1919. (Matt. 24:14) However, in view of the urgency of our times, it seems wise to make further adjustments to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Millions of people enjoy reading </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> because it covers a wide variety of secular topics in an appealing way. No doubt the majority of those who attend the Memorial each year are regular readers of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> Still, if anyone hopes to be concealed in “the day of Jehovah’s anger,” he will need help to do more than be a regular reader of our publications.—Zeph. 2:3; Rev. 14: 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Hence, from January 2006, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> will place</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. Originally, for whom was </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> primarily published, and for whom </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. What is the name of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font12"> today, and what has been its purpose from the beginning?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3.</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"> Awake!</span><span class="font12"> has been a powerful tool in the fulfillment of what prophecy?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">4. (a) What does a person need to do if he is to be concealed in “the day of Jehovah’s anger”? (b) According to Revelation 14:6, 7, what does the “angel flying in midheaven” call on all to do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">5. (a) Starting with the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> of January 2006, what will be featured more prominently? (b) What may many be moved to do, and in fulfillment of what prophecy?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">greater emphasis on God’s Kingdom. It will encourage readers more straightforwardly to look to the Bible for the solutions to their problems and will highlight more prominently the Bible’s explanation of current events. In this way, readers will get a better understanding of current events and perhaps be moved by what they read to learn more about Jehovah.—Zech. 8:23.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> Awake!</span><span class="font12"> will continue to feature topics of general interest. However, more emphasis will be laid on the Bible. (1 Thess. 2:13) Since </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> contains deep Biblical information and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> will feature more material that is Scriptural in nature, it does not seem necessary to continue publishing </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> twice a month. Therefore, beginning with its January 2006 issue, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> will be published as a monthly magazine. This will result in considerable simplification in the preparation, translation, and shipping of our literature.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> This change will affect about 40 percent of the languages in which </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> is published. In most languages, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> is already a monthly or a quarterly publication. There will be no change in the publication of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Publishers may offer each month’s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">with either issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> for that month. Those who feature </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> will be able to use the same issue all through the month without having to change their presentation in the middle of the month, as at present.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Since its first issue back in 1919, the magazine successively known as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, Consolation,</span><span class="font12"> and now </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> has played a major role in the preaching work. We pray that Jehovah will continue to bless the distribution of the magazine in its revised format and that it will help many more people out of “all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues” to turn to God’s Kingdom as their only hope.—Rev. 7:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">6, 7. (a) How will </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> seek to help many to apply 1 Thessalonians 2:13? (b) How frequently will </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> be published, and how many languages will be affected by the change?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">8. How may publishers use </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> along with </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower?</span></p></li>

When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Worship God </span><span class="font12">book. The objective should be to start a home Bible study, especially with individuals who have already studied the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font12"> book and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">June: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Learn From the Great Teacher.</span><span class="font12"> If individuals say they have no children, offer the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Family Happiness</span><span class="font12"> book or the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font12"> book and make an effort to start Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ In the United States, any direction you write on the DPA card, including medical options, should be in English. This will help to ensure that medical personnel fully understand your wishes. Book study overseers in non-English-language congregations should see that all are given assistance in this matter as needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Congregations should release the latest issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> as soon as they are received. That will allow publishers to become familiar with the contents before offering the magazines in field service. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> also should be released to the publishers as soon as it arrives. It may be distributed through the Congregation Book Study arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ Congregation secretaries should maintain an adequate supply of the forms </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Application for Regular Pioneer Service</span><span class="font12"> (S-205) and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Application for Auxiliary Pioneer Service </span><span class="font12">(S-205b). These can be ordered on the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Literature Request Form</span><span class="font12"> (S-14). Maintain at least a one-year supply. ■ The Memorial will be held on Thursday, March 24, 2005. If your congregation normally has meetings on Thursday, these are to be switched to another day of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available. If this is not possible and your Service Meeting is affected, the parts that are particularly applicable to your congregation may be incorporated into another Service Meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ A number of publishers have telephoned the branch office regarding certain recordings of Kingdom songs sung in a popular style that are presently being circulated among Jehovah’s Witnesses. They wonder if these recordings have the organization’s approval. We are aware of these recordings and would like to inform you that they do not have our approval. Please do not circulate or download these recordings from the Internet. We trust this information will clarify matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office within 30 days after reaching 18 years of age. A male noncitizen under the age of 26 who takes up residency in the United States must also register with Selective Service within 30 days of becoming a resident. All of those required to do so should comply with this law, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. From the time he registers until the year he turns 26, a brother must notify Selective Service of any change of address within ten days of the change. Elders should be aware of young brothers nearing the age of 18 and new alien residents between the ages of 18 and 26 and remind them of their duty to register with the Selective Service System.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 7: Offering Prayer at the Study</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">'In order for Bible students to make spiritual progress, Jehovah’s blessing is essential. (1 Cor. 3:6) Therefore, it is proper to open and close an established study with prayer. We can often do this from the very first study with people who are religiously inclined. With others, we may need to discern the appropriate time to introduce prayer. You might use Psalm 25:4,5 and 1 John 5:14 to help the student see why prayer should be offered and also use John 15:16 to explain the importance of praying to Jehovah through Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Who should offer prayer at a Bible study? If a baptized brother accompanies a sister on a study, he would offer prayer, although the sister might conduct the study while wearing a head covering. (1 Cor. 11:5, 10) On the other hand, if an unbaptized male Kingdom publisher accompanies a sister on a study, she would offer prayer. In such a situation, she should wear a head covering when praying as well as when conducting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> What the Prayer May Include: </span><span class="font13">Prayers at a Bible study need not be lengthy, but they should be specific. Besides seeking God’s blessing on the study and giving thanks for the truths learned, it is fitting to give praise to Jehovah as the Source of instruction. (Isa. 54:13) We can also include expressions that reflect our sincere interest in the student and our appreciation for the organization that Jehovah is using. (1 Thess. 1: 2, 3; 2:7, 8) Our asking for Jehovah’s blessing on the student’s efforts to apply what he is learning can help him to see the importance of being a ‘doer of the word.’—Jas. 1:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Many are the benefits of prayer. It brings God’s blessing. (Luke 11:13) It emphasizes the seriousness of studying God’s Word. As the student listens to our prayers, he is learning how to pray. (Luke 6:40) Moreover, prayers that spring from a heart filled with love for God and gratitude for his matchless qualities can help the student to develop a personal relationship with Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

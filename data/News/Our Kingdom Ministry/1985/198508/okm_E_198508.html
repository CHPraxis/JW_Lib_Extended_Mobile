These thousands of new ones who are saying, “We will go with you people,&quot; need our continued help to be Instructed about Jehovah’s ways.’—Zech. 8:23; Mic. 4:2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Manifesting the “Spirit of Faith”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> It takes genuine faith to speak the message of God’s Kingdom boldly. The apostle Paul wrote: “Now because we have the same spirit of faith as that of which it is written ... we too exercise faith and therefore we speak.” (2 Cor. 4:13) Jehovah’s people today have that faith. And speak we did—in excess of 505 million hours during the 1984 service year! Among those who took the lead in this display of genuine Christian faith were the pioneers. Congregation publishers, too, made a commendable display of genuine faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> As a Kingdom publisher you hold the key position in the modern theocratic society. Faith that these are the last days, along with a sense of urgency, may move you to examine your circumstances prayerfully to see if you can do more as a Kingdom publisher, perhaps even pioneer. Do you have family obligations? Responsibilities in the congregation? Perhaps your health is not the best. Some have financial commitments. Still others may feel they are too old. For some, these may be legitimate reasons for not entering the pioneer work now. But tens of thousands of our brothers and sisters have kept the goal of pioneer service before them and, when circum</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Joyfully Increasing Our Praise to Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Summer has been a busy season for all of us, theocratically and otherwise. For families with children home from school, there were perhaps additional responsibilities in caring for their needs. Some may have been able to auxiliary pioneer for a month or two. Vacation time provided a change of pace for many, and there was the activity in planning for and attending the “Integrity Keepers” Convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Now as we again settle into our regular routine, it is time to plan our activities for the months ahead. The district convention program encouraged us to increase our Kingdom service. How can we do that during the new service year, and especially during the autumn months that are now upon us?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> As summer ends, it may be easier to find more people at home when we call. Pleasant fall weather conditions may allow for longer days in field service. This can be advantageous if the congregation has either outlying territory or other areas yet to be worked this year. How will you be able to widen your service opportunities in the days ahead? stances allowed, have joyfully entered the pioneer ranks.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> “The assured expectation” we have as Christians should influence our decisions and deeply affect our lives. If you are about to finish high school, ask yourself: ‘How can I best show my love for God and for Christ with the freedom I have as a young unencumbered person?’ Are material pursuits robbing some in your family of the joy of increased service? Some who have retired from their secular work have found their new situation opens the door to pioneer service. Whatever your situation, your faith can be given fuller expression by honestly appraising your circumstances with a view to serving as a regular pioneer. —Heb. 11:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The pioneer ranks increased from 29,764 to 34,232 last September when the 1985 service year began. During the one month of August 1984, more than 4,300 applications for regular pioneer service were received. Can we do something similar this September? Pioneer applications should be submitted a month in advance. However, if you wish to take up the pioneer work the first of September </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 8, col.</span><span class="font13"> 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IN SCHOOL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> What about you young ones who are still in school? No doubt you had opportunities to witness to schoolmates and teachers during the past school year. Now, however, you may have different teachers and classmates. Do they know that you are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? If not, you will want to make it known to them during the first few weeks in school this year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> As worldly holidays come up, some will want to know why you do not join in the celebrations. Take advantage of their curiosity and receptiveness by witnessing to them. Perhaps you will be asked to make a report on what you did during the summer. Tell them about the unique experience that you enjoyed attending the district convention. Have your teachers received the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">School </span><span class="font13">brochure? Use the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Youth</span><span class="font13"> books to give a witness, or share with others selected articles from </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font13">Many of our brothers and sisters were first introduced to the truth by classmates who were Witnesses.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Can you make definite plans to pioneer for at least a year? Your sense of firm commitment will give you added incentive. If you cannot adjust your circumstances just now to serve as a regular pioneer, can your service as a congregation publisher be improved or can you possibly serve as an auxiliary pioneer periodically or even continuously? Faith grows when exercised. Your faith and confidence can be nourished by auxiliary pioneering, and you may even realize that, with Jehovah’s help and blessing, you can serve as a regular pioneer.—Mal. 3:10; Luke 14:28-30.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Just before the summer started, many of us were privileged to share in the auxiliary pioneer work during the months of March and April. Have you considered doing it again this autumn? September has five Sundays, November has five Saturdays, and December has five Sundays plus time off from school for the holidays. Why not make plans right now to auxiliary pioneer this fall? The elders will be more than glad to give you an application.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> There may be other personal circumstances that will change with the coming of autumn. As Christians, we want to take advantage of favorable opportunities for increasing our Kingdom service.

Does the congregation have territory that should be worked before winter months set in? Are arrangements being made for groups to work in outlying areas of the territory? Some publishers who are making special arrangements to increase Kingdom service during autumn months may be called on for prepared comments on what they will be doing. What field service arrangements are being made to help those who will be auxiliary pioneering during these months? Encourage those who wish to pioneer to turn in applications now.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Theocratic submission is a key factor in the progress and spiritual advancement of a congregation. Paul emphasized this at Hebrews 13:17: “Beobedient to those who are taking the lead among you and be submissive, for they are keeping watch over your souls as those who will render an account.” This indicates that the spiritual well-being of the congregation as a whole, as well as of each one individually, depends upon our willingness to cooperate and work closely with the elders as they fulfill their responsibilities as shepherds of the flock.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Further emphasizing this, Paul made this appeal: “Now we request you, brothers, to have regard for those who are working hard among you and presiding over you in the Lord and admonishing you; and to give them more than extraordinary consideration in love because of their work.” (1 Thess. 5:12, 13) We can show this consideration not only by being respectful toward the elders but more importantly by doing all we can to assist them in getting the work done.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WORK OF ELDERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Consider some of the responsibilities assigned to the elders. Besides teaching at meetings, they also take the lead in the field ministry. (1 Pet. 5:2, 3) Correspondence with the Society and other necessary business must be handled. (Compare Acts 6:1-6.) They look after the spiritual welfare of those experiencing problems, helping them avoid anything that would endanger their relationship with Jehovah. (John 10:11, 15) So, they are required to spend much time dealing with matters connected with the Kingdom work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CARRY OUR OWN LOAD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Since all of us are imperfect, we may offend each other at times, resulting in strained relations. But, personal difficulties of a minor nature should be resolved quickly and privately.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The First of Chronicles</span><span class="font12"> (set of two; congregation and public: $3.00; pioneers: $2.50) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—English </span><span class="font13">139-40) If you are convinced that someone in the congregation has committed a serious sin against you personally, do not be hasty to turn to the overseers or someone else, requesting them to intervene in your behalf. As Jesus counseled, speak privately with the one against whom you have a complaint. (Matt. 18:15, 16; </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">om</span><span class="font13"> p. 142, pars. 2, 3) If you are unable to resolve the matter and it is turned over to the elders for investigation and judgment, leave the problem in their hands, trusting in Jehovah that it will be resolved.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> We can be a great help to the elders by following Scriptural principles that direct us to be modest, chaste in our conduct, and diligent in caring for our family responsibilities. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">{om</span><span class="font13"> pp. 63-4; Titus 2:2-5) Our dress, grooming, and decorum should bespeak the dignity associated with worshiping Jehovah at his house. (Eccl. 5:1; 1 Tim. 2:9, 10; Gal. 6:4, 5) Our conscientious effort in these areas will help maintain a wholesome spirit in the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> The elders are concerned about the prompt, orderly handling of congregational affairs. They greatly appreciate it when we share in service regularly, turn in reports promptly, and fulfill our assignments in the Theocratic Ministry School. Working our assigned territory thoroughly, and promptly reporting its coverage, is also helpful. Doing our share to keep the Kingdom Hall clean and in good repair is a fine way to assist the elders.—Neh. 10:39.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HELP OTHERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Keeping the congregation spiritually strong and active is a major concern of the elders. (1 Thess. 2: 7, 8) We can assist personally in helping others by ‘speaking consolingly to the depressed souls and supporting the weak.’ (1 Thess. 5:14) Our zeal for the preaching work serves to motivate others to do more. A keen personal interest in our brothers helps keep the congregation strong.—Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> So while the elders are assigned to shepherd the flock, it takes everyone, each one doing his share, to ensure the proper ‘growth of the body and the building up of itself in love.’ (Eph. 4:16; Prov. 11:14) If we appreciate the vital role played by theocratic submission in the spiritual growth of the congregation, we will ‘reckon the elders worthy of double honor’ and give them wholehearted cooperation as they shepherd the flock of God.—1 Tim. 5:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' IPRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS ' </span><span class="font10">K____________________________________________________________________Z</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With Personal Conviction</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul, in recalling the hard work of the Thessalonica congregation, said to them, “The good news we preach did not turn up among you with speech alone but also with power and with holy spirit and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">strong conviction . . .</span><span class="font13"> and you became imitators of us and of the Lord.” (1 Thess. 1:5, 6) Yes, Paul and his associates, ailong with the congregation in Thessalonica, knew for a certainty that they were worshiping God properly. This conviction was reflected in their speech. Our ministry, too, should reflect strong personal conviction.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SPEAK FROM THE HEART</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> How can we reflect personal conviction in our ministry? Basically it involves expressing what is in our heart. Our manner of presenting the good news should show that we truly believe what we are saying. If we speak from our heart, our sincerity and personal conviction will shine through, for ‘out of the heart’s abundance the mouth speaks.’—Luke 6:45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> If we are to reflect personal conviction, we must have a deep appreciation for the truth and for Jehovah’s organization. Having the truth, it is your responsibility to help others learn it. Thinking positively about these things will help piotivate you to present the truth with conviction. Jesus set a fine example for us in speaking with the Samaritan woman.—John 4:21-24.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The way we offer literature reflects whether we are speaking from the heart. When presenting the good news, we should be familiar with the literature offer and select specific points that can be used to whet the householder’s appetite. This will also build up our confidence as we present the literature.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AVOID MANNERISMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Sometimes certain mannerisms can affect the householder’s view of our sincerity and conviction. Needlessly looking at our literature or allowing our gaze to wander while speaking to a householder could give the impression that we are not sincere. We should look at our householder while speaking, indicating that we believe what we are saying.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Some who are shy may find it difficult to maintain visual contact with the householder. Is this your problem? If so, what can be done about it? Sometimes this problem is a result of thinking too much about your own weaknesses and inabilities while speaking, perhaps feeling that someone else is better qualified to help the person. However, this is Jehovah’s work. Think of Jehovah and his unlimited power and might instead of your own weaknesses. When the apostle Paul was in a position where he had to stand alone, he said, “the Lord stood near me and infused power into me, that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished.” (2 Tim. 4:17) You, too, can receive power from Jehovah through prayer.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Other mannerisms, such as shifting from one foot to another or excessively thumbing through your Bible or literature, may reveal nervousness. These mannerisms can be controlled if you become aware of them and rely on Jehovah to help you to develop greater courage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Facial expressions, too, are important since they generally reveal what is in your heart. Strong conviction and a sincere interest in the householder should be reflected in your countenance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Our choice of words also has a large bearing on the impression we leave. If we repeatedly use expressions such as “I think” and “maybe” the householder could get the idea that we are not sure of what we are saying. Our choice of words should reflect conviction on our part. —Compare Matthew 7:28, 29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> As you work hard to present the good news with personal conviction, you can have the assurance that ‘your labors are not in vain in connection with the Lord.’—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit Assembly Program to Help Us Glorify God</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">“Doing Our Part in Glorifying God” is the theme of the new series of circuit assemblies starting in September. We have many reasons for wanting to glorify God. Unlike people of the world who are quick to praise men for their accomplishments while remaining blind to Jehovah’s wonderful works, our objective in life is to “do all things for God’s glory.” (1 Cor. 10:31) This circuit assembly program will help us to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Besides featuring encouragement for pioneers and for those who may be able to take up the pioneer ministry, the Saturday program highlights the need to keep strict watch on how we walk if we are to glorify God. (Eph. 5:15, 16)</span></p>

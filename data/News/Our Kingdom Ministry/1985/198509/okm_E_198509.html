<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Demonstrating Faith by Being Content</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Being content in a world that is filled with discontent requires strong faith. Most people are not satisfied with what they have. They want more, no matter what the cost maybe. (Eccl. 5:10,12b; 1 Tim. 6:9) Satan tries to cultivate materialistic inclinations in us, tempting us with things ‘desirable to the eyes.’ (1 John 2:16) This is what he did in the garden of Eden, and it worked. So he uses similar schemes to trick the unwary today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> To defend ourselves against Satan’s trickery, we need to demonstrate our faith by being content with what we have. Jesus taught his disciples to pray to the Father for “our bread for this day.” (Matt. 6:11) Being satisfied with his provisions leaves us free from anxiety so as to put Kingdom interests first. To strive for material things would belie our claim in this regard. (Matt. 6:33) Jesus warned that we should not store up “treasures upon the earth.” He urged us to keep our eye simple, focused on just one thing, the doing of God’s will.—Matt. 6: 19, 22.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Marvelous New Helps for Our Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The announcement that appeared in the June 1 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">regarding this past summer’s “Integrity Keepers” Convention surely aroused the interest of many. It stated that the concluding presentation on Saturday “will provide you with something beautiful that not only will be a treasure to you but also should make a tremendous impact on our activity in the field ministry.” And on that afternoon we were indeed surprised and delighted at receiving the marvelous new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Life—How Did It Get Here! By Evolution or by Creation!</span><span class="font12"> Some remarked: “It’s a masterpiece.” Others commented on the fine teaching aids in its illustrations and photographs, many in beautiful full color. Still others noted the vast amount of research that had been done, as evidenced by the documentation at the end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> No doubt the new </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font12"> book will pave the way for many to come to an accurate knowledge of God and his creative works. Did you note that while the book thoroughly deals with the questions that arise about evolution, it has even more to say about the Creator, Jehovah God? It highlights his exis</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">KEEP THE KINGDOM FIRST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> After coming to a knowledge of the truth, we had to make changes in our lives. Now we must be determined to keep putting Kingdom interests first. We would not want to be attached to material possessions as was the rich, young ruler. He asked Jesus, “What good must I do in order to get everlasting life?” Not willing to make the changes Jesus recommended, he went away grieved. (Matt. 19:16-22; Luke 18: 18-23) However, we are happy to make these changes. Now that we are moving in the right direction, the challenge is to keep the Kingdom first in our lives. Working to provide suitable “sustenance and covering” is right and necessary. But Satan has a way of inducing a person to become more and more involved in his secular work, thus causing Kingdom interests to slip into the background. We can avoid Satan’s subtle snares by being content, not letting the love of money lead us astray.—1 Tim. 6:7-10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Like the apostle Paul, we gain </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font12"> 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">tence, his works, his purpose for humans and for this earth, as well as his prophetic Word and its fulfillment. Thus, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font12"> book will likely have a profound effect on the lives of sheeplike persons who have had doubts about the existence of God. Too, how timely its publication is now, when more and more people throughout the world are turning away from belief in a purposeful Creator! During December we will be featuring the new book in the field, and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font12">will have more to say about this later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The June 1 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> also noted that at the convention “you will receive what will prove to be long-lasting assistance to reason with others from the Scriptures.” And that is just what was provided in the new book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures.</span><span class="font12"> Every major subject that someone might bring up in the field is covered. Did you note the helpful feature toward the end of many subjects under the heading, “If Someone Says—”? This gives us the most common objections on</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">20 min: </span><span class="font12">How Can We Strengthen One Another’s Faith? Talk ana audience discussion. Elder handling this part should first draw comments from audience on practical ways to apply the following points so as to build up our own faith and strengthen this quality in others. (1) Draw close to Jehovah, Jesus Christ, and to one another within the congregation. (Heb. 11:6) (2) Make the Christian ministry one of the most important things in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Demonstrating Faith </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font12">many blessings by building our lives around the Christian ministry. He worked hard and he encouraged fellow Christians to do the same. (1 Thess. 2:9; 2 Thess. 3:7-12) His thoughts were constantly on how he could advance Kingdom preaching, and yet he showed a tender concern for the spiritual welfare of all in the congregations. (1 Thess. 2:7, 8) We should also concern ourselves with the spreading of the good news and with the needs of others. Contentment comes from knowing that we are doing what Jehovah wants us to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">life and share in it with others. (Jas. 2:26) (3) Let the strong bear “the weaknesses of those not strong.” (Rom. 15:1; Gal. 6:10) (4) Encourage upbuilding conversation, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font12"> Bible reading, and perseverance in prayer. Elder then explains that this takes much time and effort in our day-to-day routine. It may not be easy for some but is necessary. (Jude 3) Why must we strengthen one another’s faith while keeping up our guard? Devil seeks to destroy our relationship with Jehovah by false teaching, loose conduct, disregard for divinely constituted authority, murmuring and complaining, selfishness. How vital is it that we strengthen one another’s faith? “The righteous one will live by reason of faith.”—Gal. 3:11; Rom. 1:16,17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DOING WHAT WE CAN DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Some of us can devote more time to the field ministry than others. But we cannot judge others by our situation. Individual circumstances vary. Age, health, and family responsibilities are all factors to be considered. So we should not be critical of others but continue to be moved by faith to work for personal improvement, serving God to the full extent that our own circumstances permit. Such an attitude will not cause discontent or be discouraging to others.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah has given us much to do in the Kingdom work. In September so forth. Have audience comment on what they hope to do during the 1986 service year.</span></p></li></ul>

Elder demonstrates how he would discuss need for peaceableness with a new publisher who has been trained according to the world’s aggressive tactics and still has a tendency to show favoritism to people he thinks are important. Stresses replacing human wisdom with divine wisdom and the need to be a peaceable evangelizer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> September is back-to-school time. For many young Witnesses this means new teachers, new subjects, and new challenges. As you are being taught in school, you also have the opportunity to teach others. You can share the good news of the Kingdom with your teachers and your classmates. Your skillful witnessing at school can do much to bring praise to Jehovah’s name and will bring great satisfaction and joy to you.</span></p></li></ul>

(Ps. 110:3; Matt. 19:13, 14) By involving yourself zealously in witnessing to fellow students and by maintaining upright and honest conduct while in school, you will be sharing in the sanctification of Jehovah’s name. (Prov. 27:11) Your sincere example of faith may incite others also to glorify Jehovah God. —Matt. 21:15,16; Phil. 2:20.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Keep in mind that skill comes with training and practice. Just learning to play a musical instrument does not mean that a person plays well.

<p><span class="font12">gressing just as the youthful Jesus did. (Luke 2:52) Learn to read well. Apply yourself to your school studies. View your family and congregational studies seriously. By doing this, you can be viewed favorably, as was the young man Timothy. —Acts 16:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT PARENTS CAN DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Parents, encourage and help your children to witness informally while they are in school. Show them that standing up for the truth and bearing witness to it often safeguards and protects them from getting involved in wrong conduct while at school. It also builds respect among non-Witness students.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> In school, situations often arise in which there is much peer pressure to participate in class projects or day trips at times other than during regular school hours. Pressure from teachers and athletic coaches to participate in extracurricular activities may be greater than your child can withstand alone. Fine information has been published on pages 22-5 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font12"> brochure to reinforce correct thinking on these matters. Why not make such subjects the basis for your weekly family study for a while? The section found on pages 8-11 briefly but clearly outlines moral principles a young Witness should follow in order to please Jehovah. If additional in-depth study is desired, more information can be found in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Youth </span><span class="font12">book. Taking the necessary time to consider these matters with your children will produce beneficial results.—Prov. 22:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">USE THE </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">SCHOOL</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> BROCHURE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Why not take the brochure with you to school? If your teacher does not have a copy, make one available. Show how things are outlined forthrightly but briefly, and explain that you would appreciate having the teacher read the brochure to become familiar with what to expect of your conduct throughout the school year. This can save you many difficulties in connection with flag salute ceremonies, holidays, and other situations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> As you continue to apply Christian principles during the school year, you can be sure that many fine blessings from Jehovah await you, both now and in the future. As Proverbs 20:11 says, “Even by his practices a boy makes himself recognized as to whether his activity is pure and upright.”—See also Psalm 37:37.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">/</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By Using Published Suggestions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> To become proficient at a trade requires much time and effort. Some trades require a person to refine his skills continually through additional education or training. Similarly, being effective servants of our God Jehovah involves progressing in the truth and keeping up to date in our ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> When Jesus sent out the 70, he taught them what they should say and how to conduct themselves. (Luke 10:1-11) He reviewed with them principles on Christian living and matters pertaining to their ministry. The apostle Paul also stressed the need to keep ministerial skills sharpened, when he admonished Timothy: “Pay </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">constant attention</span><span class="font12"> to yourself and to your teaching.” (1 Tim. 4:16) All of this shows that proper training is needed to be successful in the Christian ministry. To meet this need, “the faithful and discreet slave” provides many aids, one of which is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HELPFUL REMINDERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Through the years this monthly provision has given us many helpful reminders. In it we find recommended presentations, the offer for the month, instructions on how to conduct our house-to-house ministry, and other information on how to improve our field service activity. But to benefit fully from such direction, we need to apply the things we learn. By doing so, we tap the wisdom and experience of brothers who have a rich background as active preachers of the good news. Psalm 19:7 says: &quot;The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise.” Hence, especially those who have just begun to publish the good news can benefit from helpful counsel given in each issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font12"> Those active for many years also show wisdom by taking full advantage of the fine suggestions and direction given. So whether we are new or experienced in the ministry, appreciatively applying helpful reminders brings rich rewards.—Ps. 119:2; compare Proverbs 1:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Consider the example of a brother who took to heart the direction in the May 1983 issue under “Presenting the Good News—By Developing Magazine Routes.” How did he benefit? Now he calls regularly on some 60 people, supplying them with the current magazines. Certainly this brother and those he now regularly calls on have been blessed by his applying the direction found in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> In the June 1981 issue, the article “Have You Worked Your Territory Thoroughly?” made a very helpful suggestion on working notat-homes. It had to do with keeping a good record of not-at-homes and then calling back on them before leaving the territory. One congregation following this suggestion has found that 50 percent of those not at home earlier were contacted when the publishers returned an hour or so later. Hence, they too have experienced the happiness that comes from heeding fine suggestions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> When on vacation, a couple applied the suggestion found in the June 1984 issue under “Presenting the Good News—When on Vacation.” Looking for occasions to give an informal witness, they were able to place literature and to have many fine conversations. They found that this made their vacation more enjoyable. While visiting with friends and relatives, their experiences provided a basis for upbuilding conversation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Jesus exhorted his apostles: “If you know these things, happy you are if you do them.” (John 13:17) He knew that his disciples would be truly happy in their ministry if they put into practice the things he taught them. Yes, happiness in the ministry results from taking advantage of what Jehovah’s organization provides. Let us continue to use the reminders and suggestions provided in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry so</span><span class="font12"> that we may be effective servants of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Marvelous Helps &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">that particular subject and how we can tactfully deal with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Did you notice, too, the very useful section near the front of the book, “Introductions for Use in the Field Ministry”? It shows how experienced Witnesses in many lands begin conversations on basic subjects of interest to people in the territory. Yes, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> should be a practical help to all of us, whether we have</span></p>

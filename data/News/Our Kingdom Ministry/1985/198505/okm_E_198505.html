<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Building One Another Up</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Paul tells us, “You are all sons of light and sons of day.” He urges us to keep awake, keep our senses, and keep on our armor. And why? “Because God assigned us ... to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. . . . Therefore keep . . . building one another up, just as you are in fact doing.” (1 Thess. 5:5-11) We are living in the time when sudden destruction is to come on the present wicked system of things. So we have good reason to encourage one another. How can we do this?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BY SHARING IN FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> One way is by working with different brothers and sisters in the field service. We need to get better acquainted with one another. Working together in field service provides an excellent opportunity to share upbuilding experiences. Also, we can help one another perform this ministry. So while caring for our fundamental responsibility to preach and make disciples, we can also be building up our brothers. (Mal. 3:16; Matt. 28:19, 20) Why not arrange now to work with someone, perhaps someone you have not worked with recently?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> During the summer months, many take vacations away from home. This may offer further good opportunity to encourage others.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Youths, Praise the Name of Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> On his second missionary journey Paul met Timothy who “was well reported on by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.” He invited Timothy to accompany him in the missionary work. (Acts 16:1-3) Years later Paul wrote about Timothy, “For I have no one else of a disposition like his who will genuinely care for the things pertaining to you.” (Phil. 2:20) The Bible also tells us about Samuel who while still very young was found to be well pleasing both to men and to Jehovah. (1 Sam. 2:26) Fine Christian youths today would like to have similar reports made about them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Both Samuel and Timothy owed much of their spiritual advancement to the godly training given them by devoted parents. (1 Sam. 1: 26-28; 2 Tim. 3:15) Today, also, for a young person to establish a good relationship with Jehovah, he must respond favorably to the counsel and training of his Christian parents.—Prov. 6:20; Eph. 6:1-4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OBTAINING ASSISTANCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> No doubt both Samuel and Timothy also received much spiritual Why not plan ahead to attend the local congregation meetings and to share in field service wherever you spend your vacation? The brothers there will appreciate your good companionship and spiritual conversation, and you will be built up too. Perhaps your only travel this summer will be to the district convention. Plan now to share in the field service on Friday afternoon. There are many things that arise during the summer months that can distract us from the preaching work, but by planning our activities around field service and other congregation functions, our vacations can be spiritually refreshing to us and upbuilding to others.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BY EXAMPLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The apostle Paul recognized that his good example influenced others and was a source of great encouragement to his brothers. (Phil. 1:13, 14) When we set a good example, even in little things, it has the same effect. For instance, do you meet regularly with the group when you share in field service? Are you well prepared, having read the publications being offered? Do you give careful thought to how you will present them? Doing so will set a good example for others and will add luster to your own presentation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font13"> 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">encouragement and assistance from the elders and others who reported favorably on their conduct. Many of our ministerial servants are young adults who have made fine spiritual advancement. They can help you to build an appreciation for the field service. Why not work in the field ministry with them? Eagerly seeking the aid of these brothers will help to make your spiritual advancement manifest.—1 Tim. 4:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Your parents, the elders, and the ministerial servants are all interested in your spiritual advancement. They should have reason to report favorably on your conduct both inside and outside the congregation. No doubt you are impressed with the special attention the Society has given to young people. Your sincere response will help you to praise the name of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCRIPTURAL PRESENTATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> During May we will be offering the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book. The new Topic for Conversation is one that young publishers should find easy</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">15 min: How Many Can Auxiliary Pioneer This Summer? Chairman: Summer is an excellent time for auxiliary pioneer service. Vacation time and favorable weather make it easier to meet hour requirement. June may be a good month for you to auxiliary pioneer, and perhaps you could continue through August. What better way is there to enjoy the summer and reap lasting happy benefits? (Acts 20:35) Why not discuss as a family how many in your household can auxiliary pioneer one or more months during this summer? If some are not able to pioneer, can they assist other family members to do so? Many who have started auxiliary pioneering have gone right on into the regular pioneer service. Interview two or three publishers who have pioneered during school vacation or summer months. What blessings did they have? Did the joys make it worth the effort? Why can they recommend it to others? Encourage those who qualify to consider auxiliary pioneering this summer. With five weekends during June, your circumstances may permit you to serve as an auxiliary pioneer. If not, then demonstrate the pioneer spirit by making this summer a special time of activity by having as full a share as possible in the ministry.—Rom. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 172 and concluding prayer.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Many new ones and some who have become inactive attended the Memorial celebration in April. These need personal assistance and encouragement to associate regularly so they can gain needed spiritual strength.—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> What about others who may have become irregular in the service or who frequently miss meetings? Are they perhaps discouraged because of problems they are experiencing? Could you invite such a person to work with you in the ministry or to accompany you on a Bible study? Could you include that one in other congregational activity? Often a kind and understanding word at the right time is all that is needed to help those who have become discouraged.—Prov. 25:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> As we strive to keep our spiritual armor intact and help our brothers to do the same, we will be heeding the apostle’s counsel to “assist those who are weak” and will experience the fulfillment of Jesus’ words that “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” —Acts 20:35.</span></p>

You may comment briefly on these verses and then say, “This same psalm tells us how it is possible to cope with these present distressing times and be confident of a bright future.” Now read verse 39.

<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Have you noticed that in many territories there are generally two or three common objections offered by the majority of householders?

<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> You young people who are being directed in the way of the truth today are most privileged indeed. Your whole life can be used to praise the name of Jehovah if you really want to do Jehovah’s will and take advantage of the help he provides. Make it your goal to serve Jehovah all your days. for God’s Kingdom to come and ask ~ for God’s will to be done on earth as it is in heaven. Have you ever wondered what God’s Kingdom is and how it is going to bring about God’s will on the earth?” After allowing the householder to comment, proceed to answer those questions.

J, You can show you are interested in him by asking questions about his religion or church, such as: “If I may ask, what is your religion?” Then you might inquire, “Where is your church?” Now that you have a conversation going and the householder sees that you are listening to him, you could say: “I</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">’m please</span><span class="font13">d t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">o know that</span><span class="font13">” and then begin your presentation on some common ground, such as the model prayer or world conditions. If the householder identified his religion, you could say: “As a ----- you no</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">doubt desire to see peace on the earth. Do you think that time will ever come?

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">On the Street and in Business Territory</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “We mustered up boldness by means of our God to speak to you the good news of God.” (1 Thess. 2:2) These words of the apostle Paul call to mind that boldness is necessary in presenting the good news. Especially is this the case for many when presenting the good news on the street and to business people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> One traveling overseer observed, “Many brothers and sisters, even those who have been in the truth for a number of years, have not done street work.” If you are in a city and have not shared in this feature of service, why not take the initiative now and experience the joys and blessings of street witnessing? However, in order for street work to be successful and enjoyable, it must be done in the proper way.—Compare Proverbs 22:29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">APPROACHING PEOPLE ON THE STREET</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Generally, approaching people is more effective than simply standing in one place or just walking along displaying the magazines. Since the objective of street witnessing is to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">speak with</span><span class="font13"> people about the good news, you will want to pick an area where there is considerable pedestrian traffic. One pioneer brother who regularly places 400 to 500 magazines a month works near shops and banks, which are very busy on Fridays and Saturdays. As you approach people, use an introduction that will catch their interest right away. But be discerning so as not to frighten or startle anyone. Be positive and friendly and walk along with the person when appropriate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Before participating in street work, select the particular articles you will feature in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font13">or </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> Think of interesting questions you might ask those you approach.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IN BUSINESS TERRITORY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Business territory provides a fine opportunity to reach people we do not normally find at home. However, reports indicate that very few publishers share in working business territory. Perhaps due to lack of experience, many tend to shy away from this activity. Is this an area where you need to ‘muster up boldness?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Over the years the Society has given practical suggestions for working businesses: Dress neatly; call when the establishment is not crowded; approach the manager; be brief and concise. (See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> for July 1984 and January 1985.) If you have not used these suggestions, why not try them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Does your congregation have business territory? If you have not worked from store to store and desire to do so, approach the service overseer. He can arrange for an experienced brother or sister to work with you. Practice sessions are helpful. Being prepared and having your presentation well in mind will give you the confidence and poise you need in order to be successful in working business territory. Pray for Jehovah’s blessings on your efforts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> We can be confident that Jehovah will bless our conscientious efforts to reach people with his lifesaving message. The need for thorough witnessing is urgent. Since it is often hard to find people at home, we should take advantage of opportunities to speak with people on the street and at their place of business. While we may find street witnessing and working business territory challenging, we can be successful if ‘we muster up boldness to speak the good news of God.’</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Helpful changes are being made in connection with the daily text and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font13"> arrangement. Beginning with 1986 the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font13"> will just cover the theocratic history of two or three countries along with the year’s worldwide service report. The daily text material will appear in a separate 128-page booklet entitled </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Examining the Scriptures Daily”—1986.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> This is another forward step in the Society’s program for publishing information simultaneously in many languages. Since early this year, simultaneous publication has made it possible for the vast majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses to study the same information in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> each week. Starting January 1, 1986, we will also be united worldwide in considering the daily text. How greatly this new arrangement will contribute to strengthening our Christian unity! —Compare 1 Corinthians 1:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> This new daily-text publication can be printed earlier than the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font13"> and distributed to the congregations around the world in time for everyone to start using it at the beginning of the calendar year. The small cost involved makes it possible for each one in the congregation to have a personal copy, thus facilitating family and other group discussions of the daily text. And it is of a convenient size for carrying along to meetings, work, school, or elsewhere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Congregation orders for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Examining the Scriptures Daily” —1986</span><span class="font13"> should be sent to the Society on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter, using the regular Literature Order form (S-14). Only the total number actually requested by the publishers and other interested persons should be ordered. It will be available at first in Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Samoan, Spanish, and Swedish. These will appear as “Back Ordered” on congregation invoices until the booklet is available and shipments are made. Other languages will be announced as they become available. The cost for publishers and the public is 30 cents and the cost for pioneers is 20 cents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">1986 Yearbook,</span><span class="font13"> now to cost $1.00, should not be ordered until November 1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1985 “Integrity Keepers” Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the present satanic system of things deteriorates, the integrity of Christ’s true followers will continue to be tested. Satan has tried repeatedly to break the integrity of Jehovah’s servants by various means, both subtle and direct. Men like Job and David kept their integrity, and Jehovah has seen to it that a record of their faithfulness has been preserved for our encouragement. (1 Ki. 9:4; Job 27:5; Rom. 15:4) As with those faithful men of old, Jehovah freely provides his holy spirit to those who are integrity keepers today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 1985 “Integrity Keepers” Convention will provide helpful information about what we must do in order to stand firm. Integrity calls for uncompromising loyalty to Jehovah’s righteous laws and principles at all times, not just when conditions are favorable. It requires deep faith in Jehovah and trust in his provision of holy spirit. Now we are looking forward to the district convention where we will receive encouragement and instruction that will help us to keep on walking in integrity.—Ps. 26:1, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ATTEND ALL FOUR DAYS: </span><span class="font5">Have you made plans to be in attendance all four days? From the opening session on Thursday at 1:30 p.m. until the concluding prayer on Sunday afternoon, important information vital for our spiritual health will be presented. Do not miss even one session, although this may require you to make some personal sacrifices. If you put forth genuine effort to be there, making whatever adjustments are necessary, Jehovah will certainly bless you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We encourage you to arrive early each day and to be in your place before the sessions begin. This will give you an opportunity to enjoy Christian fellowship with your brothers and sisters from other places. It will also allow you to join in praising Jehovah with song and to share in the opening prayer. Those sitting around you will certainly appreciate that you have not distracted their attention from the program by arriving late. Christian love and consideration along with respect for Jehovah and the spiritual things he is providing should motivate us to do our best to arrive on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You have already been given information about the convention your congregation is assigned to attend. Information has also been sent regarding rooming accommodations and other arrangements for your convention. Considerable planning and work have been done to see that sufficient seating, literature, food, and other provisions are available for everyone. It is understandable that circumstances may prevent some from attending where they are assigned. For instance, there may be a need to assist relatives living in another area. However, wherever possible, your cooperation in attending the convention to which your congregation is assigned will help to make a success of the convention arrangement and to avoid overcrowding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">LISTEN AND LEARN: </span><span class="font5">Jesus counseled his followers, “Pay attention to how you listen.” (Luke 8:18) He recognized that only by applying what we learn can we make progress in improving the quality of our service to Jehovah. Each year the district convention program is specially designed for the needs of God’s people. If we listen carefully to the instruction that is given on the convention program, we not only will be encouraged and built up spiritually but also will be receiving the current direction from Jehovah provided through his “faithful and discreet slave.” (Matthew 24:45-47) This is necessary if we are to keep ourselves strong spiritually and in line with theocratic procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What are some things you can do in order to pay close attention to the program? One very important thing is to get a good night’s sleep each night so that you feel refreshed in the morning and can stay alert throughout the day. If we keep in mind that our main purpose for being in the convention city is to attend and benefit from the convention program, it will help us to be balanced as to how we use our evenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another way to keep alert and benefit fully from the program is by taking brief notes. This has proved to be a valuable aid in absorbing what is said from the platform. If, as you listen to the talks, you look for the main points and write them down, it will help you to imbed these ideas in your mind so that they can be recalled. Some have found it helpful to construct their notes in an outline fashion, writing down the main points and listing supporting arguments under these main points. Keep in mind that following the district convention, there will be a review of the program on a Service Meeting in your local congregation. While taking notes, mark things that you would like to comment on during that review.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another aid in retaining more of the information presented is reviewing the program at the end of each day. Discuss with your family or others each of the program parts. This will more firmly impress the main points on your mind. (Information on page 12 of the August 22, 1984, issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> can be helpful in recalling information presented at the convention.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Taking notes may be more difficult for younger ones, but they can be encouraged to look up each scripture that is cited and perhaps even make a note of each scripture used. Before the session starts, parents could go over the program for that session with the young ones so they will know what subjects will be discussed. When young ones know they will be included in the review of the program and be asked what they learned that day, they will often listen more closely to what is said during the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CHRISTIAN CONDUCT: </span><span class="font5">Jehovah’s people are known throughout the world for their good conduct. Following the 1984 district conventions, we received some very fine comments regarding the conduct of our brothers. Hotel and motel owners made such remarks as: “We really enjoyed your people. The children are so well behaved.” “They are beautiful people.” “Every year is fine. No problems.” Comments like these do not surprise us, since ‘having love among themselves’ and ‘loving their neighbors as themselves’ are identifying marks of true Christians.—John 13:35; Matt. 22:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, there is still a need for improvement in this area. We have received other comments indicating that there is still a problem with some being careless about their conduct while staying in hotels and motels. Most hotels and motels have rules and regulations that visitors are expected to follow. Some of these rules have to do with cooking or eating in the room, noise levels, and the use of swimming pools. Would it not be proper to observe those rules? Surely this would show that one is “ready to obey.”—Jas. 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The conduct of some young ones at the convention site as well as in hotels and motels has been a matter of concern. Experience has shown that most problems arising from misbehaving young ones at hotels and motels have been due to a lack of supervision on the part of their parents or adult guardians. Jehovah’s Witnesses bring their children to conventions for them to be “taught by Jehovah” and so that they may ‘know the holy writings from infancy.’ (Isa. 54:13; 2 Tim. 3:15) This purpose can be accomplished only when young ones are sitting in their seats and listening to the program. Families should sit together during the program, rather than allow their youths to sit in groups with other young people. When young ones are volunteer workers at the convention, parents should make arrangements for them to be off work during the program in order to listen and to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has also been reported that some individuals, although seated in the audience, carry on conversations or cause other distractions, rather than listen attentively to the program. Respect for Jehovah’s table and consideration for our brothers should move us to use good judgment in these areas. No one should be roaming through the corridors or visiting with others during the program.—Ps. 34:11; Eccl. 3:1, 7b.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another area that needs attention by some is that of dress and grooming. When attending conventions, we come together to praise Jehovah at his “house” and we should dress accordingly. Our dress and grooming should conform to the high standard set out for ministers of God and not be influenced by the fact that the convention site is a sports arena or other such facility. For further information regarding dress and grooming, please see paragraphs 1 and 2 along with cited scriptures on page 131 of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SAVING SEATS: </span><span class="font5">Despite repeated counsel given on the subject in the past, there is a continuing problem with the saving of seats. Reports received from the field state that when the convention facility opens, many are waiting at the doors to rush in and save the best seats in preferred locations, not only for their family but also for their friends and relatives who often never show up. Thus, many of the preferred seats saved are never used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seats have been saved with all manner of items, such as clothing, pieces of paper, handbills, magazines, chains, tape, and rope. What has been your response to the counsel in past issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font5"> regarding the saving of seats? (Heb. 13:17) Are you one who has cooperated with the direction given, and have you cooperated with the attendants as they have endeavored to supervise this matter? Letters have been received from some interested persons stating that they went to the convention but were not able to find seats. Why? Because so many seats were being saved with something on them. So they returned home, although in reality there were more than enough seats for those in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to these and other factors it appears that a change is in order. Therefore, the guidelines regarding the saving of seats in the future are that SEATS MAY BE SAVED ONLY FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ANY WHO MAY BE TRAVELING WITH YOU IN YOUR OWN CAR GROUP. If you wish to sit with others during the convention, you can meet them at the convention site and select your seats together at the same time. Please </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">do not</span><span class="font5"> leave any articles in seats around you; otherwise those looking for seats will conclude that they are already taken. Since the attendants will be instructed accordingly, please cooperate with them as they lovingly endeavor to supervise this matter for the benefit of all in attendance. Humbly submitting to this theocratic arrangement will ensure, in most cases, that there will be plenty of seats at each location and that they will be relatively easy to find. You will be following the “golden rule” and showing that you are truly ‘faithful in little things’. (Matt. 7:12; Luke 16:10; compare 1 Corinthians 13:5.) In this connection it is recommended that you take the time to review with your family and friends the fine material regarding the saving of seats, as well as other counsel on our personal conduct at district conventions, that appeared in the insert of the May </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font5"> for the years 1980 through 1984.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BABY STROLLERS: </span><span class="font5">Please keep in mind that in many states, baby strollers may not be used in places of public assembly. Fire regulations prohibit parking them in corridors, aisles, or between rows of seats. Since larger crowds may cause congested conditions, baby strollers are potentially dangerous not only to the baby but also to any who may stumble over them. However, car or infant seats are permissible, since these can be secured in seats next to the parents. Your cooperation in this matter will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS: </span><span class="font5">Sharing in field service is a very important part of our worship. Do not miss this opportunity to add to your enjoyment of the convention by sharing the good news with others. On Friday the program is scheduled to conclude at 3:00 p.m. Be sure to make your arrangements for territory </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font5"> the Friday afternoon session begins. It would also be helpful for the group captain to get directions to the territory when the assignment is obtained so that time is not lost unnecessarily on Friday afternoon. Please bring from your congregation a supply of current magazines for use in field service at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </span><span class="font5">Conventions require work, and many volunteer workers are needed. Your congregation’s convention coordinator will receive information listing departments in need of volunteers, and he will make this known to the congregation. You can arrange through him to do volunteer work. Children under 16 years of age who work must do so with a parent or another adult at all times. We encourage parents and their children to volunteer and work together if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the convention there may be a need for additional volunteers. You may assist by going to the Volunteer Service desk upon your arrival at the convention. The brothers there will inform you of the help that is needed. Your willing service will be appreciated very much and will contribute toward the successful operation of the convention.—Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FOOD NEEDS: </span><span class="font5">Special arrangements are being made to care for our physical needs. Provisions for food and drink will be similar to what has been available at district conventions in recent years. The efforts of those who work hard in serving us are truly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Convention tickets will be available at the cost of $1.00 per sheet of ten. It is suggested that you purchase these in advance through your congregation. Purchase enough tickets to supply your family’s food needs for the first two or three days of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What a privilege it will be to attend the 1985 “Integrity Keepers” Convention! The program will fortify us to continue faithfully serving our God, Jehovah, despite the continued attacks of Satan. You will want to make every effort to be among the thousands who will attend each day. May we declare as did David, “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity,” and “as for me, in my integrity I shall walk.”—Ps. 26:1, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">[Box on page 6]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">District Convention Reminders</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING: </span><span class="font5">Your cooperation in using the listing of accommodations provided by the convention in selecting your rooms is very much appreciated. If you have not already made a reservation and forwarded a deposit, it is necessary to do so immediately if you are planning to stay overnight in the convention city. Congregation convention coordinators should be sure that Special Needs Room Request Forms have been promptly forwarded to the appropriate convention address. If you find it necessary to cancel your accommodations selected from the listing, you should write or phone the hotel/motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. If you must cancel an accommodation made through the special needs arrangement, you should notify both the landlord or hotel/motel and the convention Rooming Department so that the room may be reassigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention Rooming Department will provide, upon your request, available information on any commercial trailer or camping facilities in the convention area. Please include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BAPTISM: </span><span class="font5">At most locations the talk for baptismal candidates will be on Saturday morning. Those who plan to symbolize their dedication by water baptism should have reviewed the questions with elders in their congregation prior to the convention. A modest bathing suit and a towel should be brought by each one who arranges to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRAM TIMES: </span><span class="font5">It is the course of wisdom and shows appreciation to be in our seats when the program begins. That will be 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, 9:20 a.m. on Friday, and 9:30 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday at most conventions. The same fine qualities are displayed when we do not plan to leave before the sessions conclude. The closing song and prayer will be at 5:10 p.m. on Thursday. Friday afternoon will be set aside for a special effort in field service, following the closing song and prayer at 3:00 p.m. On Saturday the closing song and prayer will be at 5:00 p.m. and on Sunday at 4:00 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BETHEL AND GILEAD MEETINGS: </span><span class="font5">A meeting will be held on Friday for pioneers between the ages of 20 and 40 who are interested in attending Gilead School to receive training for missionary service. There will be a meeting on Saturday for any dedicated publishers between 19 and 35 years of age who are U.S. residents and who would like to enter Bethel service. Check the program at the convention city for the exact times and locations of these meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </span><span class="font5">All </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">special</span><span class="font5"> pioneers as well as traveling overseers will need to bring their Watchtower Identification and Assignment card (S-202) to the convention. Those on the list for six months at the time of the district convention they attend may receive $15 worth of convention tickets upon presentation of their Watchtower ID card at that one convention only. Treat the card as carefully as cash. It cannot be replaced at the convention. Any gift releases or other literature at pioneer rates will be available to pioneers at the bookroom only, upon showing their Watchtower ID card. Those in Bethel service may obtain these same provisions by showing their Bethel ID card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">LAPEL CARDS: </span><span class="font5">These cards are provided as a means of advertising the convention as well as to facilitate identifying our brothers and sisters in attendance. To this end, please </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">wear</span><span class="font5"> the specially designed lapel card at the convention and also while traveling to and from the convention site. Not only is the card a fine means of identification but it so often results in giving a fine witness while traveling. You should obtain these through your congregation as they will </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> be available at the conventions. The lapel cards are 2 cents each and the plastic holders are 10 cents each. (Lapel cards have already been consigned to each congregation by the Society, but the plastic holders must be ordered by the congregation.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A WORD OF CAUTION: </span><span class="font5">Regardless of where you park, you should lock your vehicle at </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> times and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font5"> leave anything visible inside. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk, if possible. Also, guard against thieves and pickpockets who are attracted by large gatherings. This includes not leaving anything of value unattended on seats at the conventions. Additionally, it has been reported that there is a greater risk of falls on stairs and ramps when sisters wear high-heeled shoes.</span></p>

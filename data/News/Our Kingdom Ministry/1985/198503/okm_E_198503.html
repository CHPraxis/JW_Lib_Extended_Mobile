<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Are We Facing Armageddon?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 16:14, 16—Armageddon —God’s war, not man’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 21:1,4—A trouble-free “new earth” to follow.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Keep Doing This ... ”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus commanded all Christians to memorialize his death. (Luke 22:19) This annual observance would serve as a reminder of the great sacrifice that he made on behalf of all mankind. This year Jehovah’s people worldwide will celebrate the Memorial of Christ’s death on Thursday, April 4, after sundown. Once again they will show their gratitude for God’s generous gift of his Son. Are you already making your plans to be there?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">GETTING READY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Advance preparation is important. What will that involve? Individuals and family groups should plan to arrive on time. If some in your family are not believers, perhaps you can stimulate their interest in this most important event. Have you made personal plans to invite newly interested ones? If you are helping others to attend, have you planned to leave your home in time to arrive at the meeting before it begins? You may need to remind new ones of the importance of being there on time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Our 1985 calendar outlines the Bible portions to be read beginning March 30 in preparation for the Memorial. Have you made plans to read over this material personally? Per</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Sharing Treasures and Increasing Wealth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Many people today center their lives around acquiring material possessions—houses, gold, silver, precious stones, and the like. However, more valuable to Christians than all these things are the spiritual treasures found in the Bible. No sum of money could ever compare to a knowledge of God’s purpose and the prospect of everlasting life! Appreciating the value of such priceless truths creates within us a desire to share them with others. —Compare 1 John 2:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah has provided his people with bountiful spiritual food in the form of books and other Bible study aids. The knowledge of God, the meaning of prophecies, the wisdom of applying Bible principles in everyday life, and the significance of world events are but a few of the many treasures that have been uncovered. Truly each publication has proved to be a storehouse of spiritual truth. How can we increase our spiritual wealth and share these treasures with others?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">INCREASING OUR WEALTH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Why not take the opportunity to study or review some of the older haps this could be done as a family group. Bible students can be informed of the portions to be read, and then they can be encouraged to read the Scriptures each day in anticipation of the Memorial observance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Elders should look after the various details that will assure an orderly Memorial observance. Attendants need to be assigned, extra seating arranged, servers selected, emblems and utensils provided. Since a larger than normal attendance is expected, thought should be given to an orderly plan for entering and exiting, especially where more than one congregation may be using the same Kingdom Hall. Also, be alert to the need for proper ventilation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER THINGS TO DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Jesus gave other commands concerning activities that we should keep obeying. One of the most important of these is to preach the good news of the Kingdom. (Mark 13:10) This lifesaving work needs to be done with urgency. Ours is a time for exceptional activity, intensified service requiring enlarged faith and zeal. Remember, one day soon will be our </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">last</span><span class="font13"> day in this old</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1}</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">publications such as the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing </span><span class="font13">and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span><span class="font13"> books? Several years have passed since these were released, and perhaps newer publishers have not had a chance to examine their contents. The information in these books has strengthened the worldwide unity of Jehovah’s Witnesses and has contributed to our spiritual development. (1 Cor. 1:10) If you have not already done so, why not obtain such older publications for your own theocratic library?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SHARING TREASURES WITH OTHERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> During the months of March and April we will be offering one of the older books for a contribution of SI.00. The December 1984 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> suggested which books to use. These God-given instruments have already proved their worth in helping many people to respond to the good news. Conscientious effort should be made to get more of them into the hands of interested people.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 205</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">10 min: Local announcements and selected Announcements from </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font13"> Encourage all to share in magazine work this Saturday. Demonstrate two one-minute magazine presentations. Feature current </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> in one and current </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> in the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">25 min: </span><span class="font13">“Sharing Treasures and Increasing Wealth.” Question-and-answer discussion. After considering paragraph 5, arrange for two demonstrations using the current Topic for Conversation and show how an effective transition can be made to one of the older publications being offered. One demonstration should feature the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> book with a setting similar to what is described in paragraph 5. The other demonstration can highlight the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span><span class="font13"> book, using the following suggested presentation: After introducing yourself, you could say, “Do you think lasting peace will ever come to this troubled world?” Allow for a reply and comment on some local happening that illustrates the concern over present world conditions. Then state, “History confirms that man’s efforts to bring about peace have failed. However, the Bible describes what a source higher than man will soon accomplish.” Then turn to page 181 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Spirit</span><span class="font13"> book and read Revelation 21:4 quoted in paragraph 35. Continue by saying, “This wonderful prospect can only be realized by means of God’s holy spirit. You can enjoy learning more about this force for everlasting peace. The book is yours for a contribution of $1.00.” Conclude by encouraging good preparation so as to be effective in using the books offered. Have participants prepare for this part well in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Keep Doing This ...” </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font13">system. Life now is short, fleeting. No one can be sure of being alive tomorrow. We have only a limited time in which to prove our faithfulness and integrity to God. (See Psalm 39:5; Luke 12:18-21.) So it would be fitting to ask ourselves: Am I satisfied with what I did </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">today?</span><span class="font13"> Have I really made sufficient plans for this Memorial season to show Jehovah and Jesus Christ that I appreciate what they have done in opening up the way to everlasting</span></p>

Encourage all to be supportive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 181 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING MARCH 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 133</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">7 min: Local announcements. Also, encourage all to share in magazine activity on fourth Saturday. Outline local arrangements. If time permits, cite articles in current magazines that may have special appeal in local territory.</span></p>

Could I increase my participation in the field ministry during this Memorial season? Have I prayerfully given consideration to auxiliary pioneer service during April in order to do all that Jesus commanded me?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> A most timely subject has been selected for the special talk to be given Sunday, April 14. It is: “Good News in a Violent World.” Be sure to invite those who come with you to the Memorial to return on this special occasion also. They need to increase their association with JehoFebruary 15 issue, capable publisher demonstrates how to encourage Bible student to attend Memorial.

<p><span class="font13">13 min: Arrange locally according to need of congregation. Or, one or two members of Congregation Service Committee can discuss encouragement and benefits from most recent visit of circuit overseer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Song 143</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font13">Local announcements and “A Need for Help at Bethel.” Elder will conduct enthusiastic question-and-answer session. Have paragraphs read. Encourage those who qualify to seriously and prayerfully consider opportunities for Bethel service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 min: “Presenting the Good News —To Relatives and Personal Acquaintances.” Questions and answers. Demonstrate a tactful approach that a publisher could use while visiting a relative. Also, demonstrate Witness sharing the truth with an acquaintance he has not seen since becoming one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">15 mln: Looking Ahead to Memorial. Talk. Review local preparations for Memorial on Thursday, April 4, after sundown. Use Memorial invitations. Stress correct date and time, especially if more than one congregation will use hall. Everyone should try to arrive early. Also, announce adjustments in meetings for the week. Encourage all to do suggested Bible reading before Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Song 165 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">vah’s people and grow in their appreciation of Jehovah and Jesus Christ. It would be good to arrive early for this talk and warmly greet all new ones present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Knowing that we have reached the final part of “the last days” of this present system should move us to perform </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">exceptional</span><span class="font13"> service. (2 Tim. 3:1) Let us show our appreciation for all that Jehovah has done for us by doing all we can in his service this Memorial season.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Teaching at Home Bible Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> One of the most joyful experiences we can have in our ministry is teaching others to be true Christians, just as Jesus commanded us. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Are you experiencing this joy?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Although we strive to be teachers in every feature of our ministry, the home Bible study activity affords the greatest opportunity to teach. So, if you do not conduct a Bible study regularly, make the matter a subject of prayer and a goal toward which to work. By so doing, many have been blessed with Bible studies and have thereby been afforded fine opportunities to teach others to be true Christians.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CAN YOU DO IT?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> It takes time and careful study for a person to become convinced of the Bible’s message about God’s Kingdom. (Matt. 10:11) For this reason we have the home Bible study arrangement. This features a comprehensive course of study covering many subjects, which are logically presented in the Society’s publications. By conducting a home Bible study regularly with the aid of one of our study publications, the majority of us can help sincere students to gain knowledge of God and Christ.—John 17:3; 1 John 5:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Jesus Christ was a master teacher; therefore, we should learn and employ his methods. How did he teach? He asked discerning questions. (Matt. 17:24-26; Luke 10: 25-36) Why did he do that? To help people to reason and examine themselves in the light of his teachings. With his questions he tactfully reached their hearts. Those he taught had to show whether they genuinely wanted to be his followers or whether their motives were insincere.—Matt. 13:10-17; Mark 8:34-38.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Additionally, Jesus’ teaching featured illustrations and object lessons; and he used other effective methods. (Matt. 4:18, 19; Luke 15: 3-10; John 13:2-16) Also, he presented matters with simplicity, brevity, and clarity. (Matthew, chapters 5-7) We can be thankful</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>G</sup> Prepare well for the study. Give thought to portions that may be hard for the students to understand, points where they will likely raise questions, and matters of special interest as well as those that apply to their everyday lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO TEACH AT A STUDY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> An established study should be opened with prayer. Your prayer requesting Jehovah’s guidance and blessing will emphasize the seriousness and dignity of the study, as well as demonstrate your sincerity as a minister of God. A brief review of the preceding lesson may be appropriate, leading into the current study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>K</sup> Many of the Bible study aids that we use in the ministry have questions for each paragraph. This feature is a teaching aid that can be used to help students to express themselves in their own words. When the correct answer to the question is not forthcoming, you may want to paraphrase the question. But, do not turn the study into a mere guessing game. Learning the truth is based on reason and logic.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Ordinarily, the study period will be about one hour. Often a chapter can be covered, but this depends on the aptitude of-those studying. Encourage students to prepare in advance and give answers in their own words. Hold to God’s Word in your teaching. (Titus 1:9) It is God’s Word that has power and that will move people to action. (Heb. 4:12) Accordingly, as time allows, look up and read key Scriptures.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> Teaching others the truth about Jehovah God, Jesus Chrwt, and the Kingdom is a marvelous privilege. (1 Cor. 3:6-9) Last year in this country an average of 416,987 home Bible studies were conducted each month! Are you enjoying this marvelous privilege of service? May Jehovah God give ear to our prayers and bless our efforts to be teachers at home Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">To Relatives and Personal Acquaintances</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> It is only natural that a person accepting the truth would be eager to share it with others, especially relatives and close acquaintances. After Andrew was invited to be Jesus’ follower, he found his brother Simon “early next morning” and declared, “We have found the Messiah.” Likewise, Philip without delay located his friend Nathanael and urged him to “come and see.”—John 1:41, 45, 46; see </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Rbt8</span><span class="font13"> footnote and Acts 10:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> What about you? Are you seeking out opportunities to speak about the truth to your relatives and acquaintances? Perhaps you have hesitated to do so out of fear that they might reject the message and change their feelings toward you. Do not hold back. Neighbor love requires that you speak the truth joyfully and without fear. (Luke 10:27) Since they already know you, your relatives may be more willing to listen to you than to a stranger who calls at their door.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY? HOW?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Remember that all mankind not serving Jehovah are “alienated” from God and so are considered “enemies.” Their lives are at stake. (Col. 1:21) Jehovah keenly desires that all persons hear the truth and “attain to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9) We have the serious responsibility to tell everyone what the future holds. (Ezek. 33:7-9) Can you think of ways to help your family and acquaintances learn the truth? Persistent and tactful efforts will often bring gratifying results.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">1985 Yearbook</span><span class="font13"> relates the experience of a woman in Japan who came into the truth as a result of a special pioneer patiently making return visits on her. She had been quite active in her former religion and had many relatives still in that religion. She began to witness to them, and within five years over 50 became Witnesses.</span></p>

By featuring the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font13"> book, perhaps we can help them overcome their doubts. The information presented on pages 116-126 could accomplish this.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> If your initial efforts produce little or no results, do not be discouraged. In many cases a favorable response is not realized until after months or even years of trying. Jesus said his sheep would hear his voice. But we need not expect them to do so at the first call. (John 10:16) For years they may have been battered by this old world, and it may require a generous use of the soothing oil of Bible truths before they will respond.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Philippians 2:15 indicates that for us to be “shining as illuminators” we have to be “blameless and innocent, children of God without a blemish.” So our family and acquaintances should be able to see that the truth has made a big change in our lives. The apostle Peter stressed the same point.—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> More is needed, however, than just a good example if our relatives are to be motivated to serve Jehovah. A witness has to be given. (Rom. 10:14; Acts 8:31) To reach family members living far from you, well-thought-out and neatly written letters may be an effective means of sharing the good news. Your letters should not be critical, but positive, upbuilding, and friendly. They should radiate the joy and hope that is in your heart since learning the truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BE POSITIVE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Some sisters have been afraid that their husbands would strongly oppose them and so they have refrained from telling them about what they do in connection with the congregation. Of course, each one will have to make a personal decision in this matter. But, never should we overlook the value of fervent prayer to Jehovah when anticipating an opportunity to witness to family members and acquaintances. (Phil. 4:6; 1 Tim. 2:1) Adopt a positive attitude. Surely Jehovah will bless your sincere efforts to present the good news to your relatives and personal acquaintances.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> In every case good preparation and flexibility are needed to be most effective. This means being familiar enough with a particular book to highlight specific points. Regardless of what publication is used, we will enjoy Jehovah's blessings if we</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> With the increase in proclaimers of the good news there is a need for more to serve at Bethel. (Isa. 6:8) There is much to do not only in printing and shipping literature but also in renovating newly acquired facilities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Due to the nature of the work, the greatest need is for single brothers, 19 to 35 years of age. Some married couples, up to 35 years of age, can also be used. Can some of you brothers, especially those who are now in the pioneer work, make yourselves available? The organization will benefit from your help, and you will benefit from the fine training and blessings received in Bethel service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Those over 35 years of age may wish to apply for regular or temporary Bethel service if they have some special skill. Their applications will be kept on file until their services are needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> All who apply should be in good physical, mental, and spiritual health, be able and willing to live and work with many others, and be able to do this without taking time off because of health problems. They should be in good standing with the congregation, have a fine report from the elders and the circuit overseer, speak English well, and be willing to do whatever work is assigned. Regular applicants should have in mind staying for a numbei<sup>-</sup> of years, learning and gaining experience as they widen out in their sacred service.—2 Cor. 6:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> If you wish to apply, obtain a Bethel application by writing to the Personnel Committee at Brooklyn or by contacting your circuit overseer. After you fill out the application it will be considered by your Congregation Service Committee and then by your circuit overseer. Those who qualify and make themselves available have the privilege, if invited to serve at Bethel, of sharing in working in cooperation with “the entire association of [our] brothers in the world.”—1 Pet. 5:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">present the good news with sincerity and firm conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Although the world places increasing emphasis on acquiring material things, we will continue to appreciate the Bible as the source of genuine wealth. During March and April we will share the spiritual treasures found in our older books and thereby increase the spiritual wealth of others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW PUBLISHER PEAK FOR THE UNITED STATES—695,687</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Remarkable Zeal Reflected in Five Other Outstanding Peaks</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The April report surely gives us cause for rejoicing! We are thankful to Jehovah for his blessing and for making things grow. (1 Cor. 3:6, 7) You will be interested In highlights of the following report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Publishers: 695,687. This is 4,857 more than our last peak in August 1984.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Auxiliary Pioneers: 100,145. An increase of 6.5 percent over the total for April 1984.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Regular Pioneers: 36,543. Compared with the number that reported in April of last year, this is an increase of 25.6 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Total Hours: 14,436,074. This is 1,481,695 more than our peak last year—an 11.4-percent increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Return Visits: 4,702,661. Exceeds our previous peak by 307,551.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Home Bible Studies: 463,933. Our third peak this service year and 19,187 more than last March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">More than ever before. Jehovah's dedicated people are demonstrating their loyalty and zeal as they keep on talking about Jehovah's sovereignty. May the number of those praising him go on increasing as his mighty acts continue to be made known.—Ps. 145:10-12.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Boldly Preaching the Good News</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> As Jehovah’s Witnesses we have many reasons to be courageous and outspoken in preaching the Kingdom message. First of all, we represent Jehovah. Second, the importance of the message itself requires that we speak with confidence. The assurance that he is with us and will infuse power into us should cause us to declare the truth fearlessly. (Jer. 1:17, 19) Additionally, the example of others who have persevered in doing God’s will in spite of hardships and obstacles can give us heart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Appreciating the importance of the good news should encourage us to proclaim it with freeness of speech. These Kingdom truths are not from a human source but are ‘through divine revelation.’ (Gal. 1: 11, 12) The Kingdom is the touchstone by which all mankind are to be judged. Thus, Jesus showed that our fearlessly preaching the good</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Others to Progress in the Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> At Luke 22:32 Jesus exhorted Peter to ‘strengthen his brothers.’ Peter did just that. His faithful ministry was a source of strength to his Christian brothers. (1 Pet. 5:12) Just as we appreciate it when we are helped to have a regular share in the field service, so do others. Ask yourself: Who in your congregation need encouragement to progress in the ministry? How can they be helped?—1 Thess. 5:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> One way is by helping them to become effective in presenting the Topic for Conversation. For example, suggest appropriate introductions for your area. Show them how questions may be asked to involve the householder and how to tie in the scriptures effectively. Suggest that they work with different brothnews was more important than even our present lives.—Mark 8:34, 35.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUST JEHOVAH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Opposition to the message only deepens our resolve to preach with boldness. (1 Thess. 2:2) Accurate knowledge of Jehovah and faith in his Word produce an internal strength that dispels fear of those who may try to hinder us. (1 Pet. 3: 13, 14) Are we not also encouraged by Jesus’ promise that he would be with us until the conclusion of the system of things’ (Matt. 28:20) As we boldly preach, we can confidently say as did the psalmist: “Jehovah is on my side; I shall not fear. What can earthling man do to me?”—Ps. 118:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Closely considering the record of faithful men can produce courageous perseverance in God’s service. Peter and the other apostles </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1) </span><span class="font11">ers and sisters and learn from their presentations. (Prov. 20:18) Arrange for practice sessions that simulate actual conditions existing in the field. (Prov. 27:17) Much can be done to help new or less experienced publishers at meetings for field service, after the book study, when traveling to the territory, or within the family group.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BE A SOURCE OF ENCOURAGEMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> There is a vital work for every Christian to do. We are urged to ■brace up our minds for activity.’ Be aware of those in the congregation with particular needs, such as the fatherless boys, the elderly, and those with unbelieving mates. Can you schedule time to work with them in the field service? (1 Pet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Just as a mountain is climbed step by step, we, too, can progress step by step in our Christian course. To this end we set spiritual goals for ourselves. This is not limited to individuals. Families can also have goals in connection with meetings, field service, and family study. Are there improvements to be made? Can certain members of the family be helped to reach the goal of full-time service? A family discussion can help toward the attaining of goals determined upon. When these are reached, other theocratic goals can be set. Thus, step by step, spiritual progress can be made.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">MEETINGS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> Some families may need to set a goal of getting to the meetings on time. This can be a real challenge for large families, for those with difficult work schedules, or where there is a problem with transportation. Cooperation and good organization are necessary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Another practical goal for the family to consider is that of commenting at meetings. Some members of the family may prefer to read a short comment. However, making brief and specific comments in one’s own words denotes spiritual progress and is rewarding. Family members can assist one smother in preparing their comments. They can also help one another to make progress in the Theocratic Ministry School. This may include listening to younger family members rehearse their assignments, showing them how to use an outline, correcting their pronunciation vorable conditions in the community to dampen our zeal? If we appreciate the value of the message we bear and see mankind’s need for a sure prospect for survival, we will not shrink back.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Prayer is another means by which we develop bold persistence in the ministry. Paul observed that “prayer on every occasion in spirit” could result in the “ability to speak of words, and so forth. The goal of becoming a good teacher or an excellent public reader is worthy of diligent effort.—1 Tim. 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Some families need to achieve regularity in the field service. Does your entire family share in the field service the first Sunday of each month? What about the goal of helping family members learn the current Topic for Conversation or a new magazine presentation? There is also the goal of starting a home Bible study or the goal may be greater regularity in conducting an already established study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FAMILY STUDY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> For some families it may be a real challenge to adhere faithfully to the schedule for a family study. On occasion it may be necessary to reschedule the study. But this should be the exception. Another excellent goal is to read the weekly Bible assignment regularly, perhaps even including it in the family study. For most persons, the actual reading of the material assigned for the week only takes 20 to 25 minutes. It can add to one’s knowledge of the Scriptures and it makes the review of Bible highlights each week more interesting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> There are many other goals that individuals and families can set for themselves. For example, what about a family effort toward auxiliary pioneer service this summer? Additionally, with good organization and cooperation, can the family sponsor at least one of its members as a regular pioneer? There is also the goal of becoming a ministerial servant or an elder. Young brothers may have Bethel service as a goal. These goals are attainable, but they require diligence and hard work. As we strive to reach our personal and family goals, the quality of our service to Jehovah will improve, all to his honor and glory.—Ps. 96:7, 8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">. . . with freeness of speech . . . , with boldness.” (Eph. 6:18-20) During times of distress, Jehovah quickly responded to the prayerful call of the psalmist by ‘making him bold in his soul with strength.’ (Ps. 138:3) May our united prayers on behalf of one another pave the way for us to show “all the more courage to speak the word of God fearlessly.”— Phil. 1:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS _</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With Discernment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “A man of discernment is cool of spirit.” (Prov. 17:27) The wisdom of these words is often proved true in our preaching activity. For example, we may come face to face with a sign that says, “No Soliciting.” Or, we may be asked to leave a building where we have been witnessing. In other areas, a custodian or a manager may refuse to grant entrance to a building. What can we do in these instances’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> “No Soliciting.” Our work of preaching the good news and leaving literature with people for a freewill contribution to cover printing costs does not constitute solicitation for funds. Yet, some people will object and refer to our preaching work as soliciting. If so, we can kindly explain that our work is not commercial, that it is a missionary and evangelizing work, and that we are ministers. In so doing, our utterance should be ‘always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how we ought to give an answer to each one.’ (Col. 4:6) If such a sign is enforced or if authorized persons insist that we are not welcome, we should quietly leave and perhaps try witnessing there at another time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> “Asked to leave the premises.” If a publisher is asked to leave a building where he has been preaching, he can tactfully show that his work is of a religious nature of utmost importance and is a public service. If the objection is to calling on Sunday, try to make arrangements to return on another day. If, after calmly talking to the person, you are ordered to leave, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Others &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">1:13; Eccl. 4:9, 10) A fine opportunity for this is in magazine activity on the second and fourth Saturdays.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Pioneers, you are in an excellent position to be helpful. Your encouraging experiences can have a good effect on others. (Acts 15:3) Why not plan to have someone join you on a Bible study or on a return visit? When making these arrangements, be sure to let the publisher know what point you hope to cover so he can share in the discussion. Your zealous activity in preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom will encourage others to do the same.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> Elders are privileged not only to you should do so. It is not wise to insist on one’s rights and contribute to further disturbances or even unnecessary arrests. If advisable, the publisher can return on another occasion or write a personal letter giving a witness to those who live there. If you return, discernment may dictate calling at only a few doors or homes. Then return later to visit a few more. If you keep an accurate record of all residents, all may eventually receive a witness.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> “Entrance to a building is refused.” Discernment calls for the words of Proverbs 15:1: “An answer, when mild, turns away rage, but a word causing pain makes anger to come up.” Thus, as mentioned before, it is usually best not to insist on one’s rights. However, in some places where entry is refused, making an appointment to talk with the superintendent of the building to explain our work may help to obtain permission to preach therein. Also, it may be possible to get into a building or an area in some normal, legal way, and call on one or more families at a time and in a manner unobserved by those who object. Of course, this should be done discreetly. At all times the dignity of our work should be maintained so that we “do all things for God’s glory.”—1 Cor. 10:31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> “The good news has to be preached.” (Mark 13:10) As we approach the end of this system, it is expected that Satan will continue to make it more difficult for us to reach sheeplike ones. May we use discernment as we preach in order to reach as many as we can with the hope from God’s Word.</span></p></li></ul>

Congregation Book Study conductors and the service overseer can review the Congregation’s Publisher Record cards from time to time in order to be aware of trends developing with regard to a person’s field service. Thus, they will be in a good position to help in training Kingdom proclaimers to become proficient in various features of service. They can help members of the flock to fight discouragement due to difficult territory or problems of life that may interfere with their service.

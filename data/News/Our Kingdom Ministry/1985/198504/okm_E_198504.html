<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> How happy we are that Jehovah never wavers in his loving-kindness! With him there is not even “a variation of the turning of the shadow.” (Jas. 1:17) He is always alert to provide what is good for those who love him. But are we constant in our devotion to him? Surely we should do our utmost to imitate Jehovah’s example.—Eph. 5:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Daniel is one of many fine Bible examples of constancy in serving Jehovah. Undeviatingly he approached Jehovah for direction and consistently carried out His will. Even when he knew that a law had been framed forbidding prayer to anyone other than the king, he continued praying to Jehovah in open view just as “he had been regularly doing prior to this.” His sentence: Death at the mouth of lions! But God sent his angel and “shut the mouth of the lions.” Darius, the king, had correctly reasoned, “Your God whom you are serving with constancy . . . will rescue you.” (Dan. 6:6-10, 16, 22) So Daniel remained steadfast in obedience to Jehovah’s requirements, and Jehovah rescued him.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If we show the same constant devotion in obedience to Jehovah’s laws, we too can confidently expect</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The month of April brings many opportunities for upbuilding association and activity, and especially in connection with the celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal on April 4. Have in mind that last year in the United States 1,611,310 people attended the Memorial! How stimulating it would be to have all these people present at the Memorial this month, along with the thousands who have become interested in the truth during this past year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> On Sunday, April 14, there will be a special public talk on the subject “Good News in a Violent World.” We want our Bible students to attend this special meeting and hear information that may reach their heart and motivate them to exercise faith. April is an excellent time to focus more attention on those with whom we have been studying.—Rom. 10:13-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Have you been training your Bible students for the ministry while to receive his blessing and approval. Is it not a joy to see the zeal for God’s work demonstrated by his people today? The zeal in Kingdom service has produced new peaks in hours, return visits, and Bible studies. How heartwarming it is also to see the large number of publishers volunteering for auxiliary and regular pioneer service! We rejoice to see this concern for the spiritual welfare of sheeplike ones out in the field. Those who are so earnestly involved are enjoying Jehovah’s approval and blessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Like Daniel, we too have enemies who would try to break down our faith and turn us aside from our constant worship of Jehovah. The Devil, the spirit of the world, and our own fleshly weaknesses bring pressure to make us vacillate in our service. How can we be strengthened to stand firm? Those who have charted a steady course in the truth for many years tell us that keeping close to Jehqvah helps them most in resisting these pressures. And how do they do that? Like Daniel, they are constant in prayer, seeking Jehovah’s guidance and direction. To make sure that they have his spirit, they regularly attend meetings, where Jehovah’s Word is discussed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1) </span><span class="font12">studying with them? This should be done progressively. Some publishers have found it helpful to review lessons by having the student present the material just as he might use it in the house-to-house ministry. Have you discussed with your Bible student what is done in field service and why? If the student has come to an accurate knowledge of the truth, if his heart has been appreciatively touched by what he has learned, and if he has brought his life into harmony with Christian principles, you can invite him to accompany you in the field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> When could a new person be invited to join us in the field service and thereby identify himself publicly with the congregation? It would be helpful to review pages 98 and 99 in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font12"> book. Has the student expressed his desire to share in the preaching work? If so, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">All of this, along with regular periods of personal study, helps them to endure tests and to incite others to “love and fine works.”—Heb. 10:24.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> By using these same avenues for gaining God’s spirit to keep them on course, faithful, devoted brothers and sisters everywhere are equipped to share with others what they learn. These steadfast ones often say that telling others of their hope is the best way to keep their own eyes on the prize ahead. And just as Daniel was strengthened by his association with other young men who were respectful of God’s laws, association with others in Kingdom service can strengthen us to remain solid in the faith and be favored by Jehovah.—Dan. 1:6,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> During April let us endeavor to set a fine example in serving Jehovah with constancy. Our zealous endeavors in working from house to house, making return visits, conducting home Bible studies, and taking advantage of other opportunities to share the good news will receive Jehovah’s blessing. And as we give proper attention to the spiritual needs of those new ones already associating with us, we can help them also to serve Jehovah with constancy. publisher could invite Bible student.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Arrangements should be made for one newly sharing in the ministry to go along with an experienced publisher, usually the one who studies with him. This allows for training. As the student becomes more at ease, he can have a larger share in the witnessing work. (Gal. 6:6) When a person turns in a field service report for the first time, the secretary of the congregation will follow through with the arrangement outlined on page 105 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry</span><span class="font12"> book. The secretary or another member of the Congregation Service Committee will discuss the matter with the publisher conducting the study, and then further arrangements should be made to meet with the. individual that is studying.

<p><span class="font12">much help and encouragement from the parents. This training should begin from infancy. (2 Tim. 3: 14, 15) Families are encouraged to study and read together with a view to maintaining a strong desire to share the truth with others regularly. Many families make it a practice to discuss the daily Scripture text and comments found in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font12"> The children should be encouraged to comment on the material. (Compare Ecclesiastes 12: 9-11.) Try to make it a point each day to speak with your family about Scriptural truths. Then they too will desire to share in the disciplemaking work.—Isa. 54:13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> When a child desires to express himself in Kingdom service and is exemplary in his conduct, the parent may approach one of the elders on the Congregation Service Committee and discuss whether the child is qualified to be counted as a publisher. (See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">om</span><span class="font12"> book, page 100, paragraph 1.) Such progress is certainly reason for rejoicing!—Prov. 23:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> There is little time left for this old system. Therefore, we are all encouraged to have a full share in the harvest work and to train new ones to qualify for this lifesaving activity.—Matt. 9:37, 38; Rev. 22:17.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Society Kingdom Hall Fund</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s Witnesses everywhere often express sincere appreciation for their local Kingdom Hall. This is because of the important purpose it serves in our worship of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> At the Kingdom Hall we experience warm Christian fellowship and an interchange of encouragement. (Ps. 133:1; Heb. 10:24, 25) The Kingdom Hall, a center of true worship, stands as a symbol of Jehovah’s Kingdom interests in the community and serves as a place where newly interested people can become acquainted with Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Ever since 1935, when the great crowd of other sheep began to be gathered in earnest, the obtaining of Kingdom Halls throughout the land has been a matter of increasing concern. (John 10:16; Rev. 7:9) Especially now, at a time when Jehovah is speeding up the ingathering work, the need for more Kingdom Halls in certain arpas has become critical. (Isa. 60:22) This is because building costs and property values have become inflated beyond reason, making it virtually impossible to arrange adequate financing locally. In an endeavor to render needed assistance, the Society Kingdom Hall Fund was established. This arrangement, first announced at the 1983 “Kingdom Unity” District Convention and explained more fully in the September 1983 issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font1"> gives Jehovah’s people everywhere an opportunity to demonstrate in an outstanding way their love for one another and their Kingdom unity.—John 13:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> It is not unusual for Jehovah’s people to demonstrate their love by sharing material things. That is the way it was among the early Christians who rallied to care for the needs of the brothers in Judea. (Acts 11:27-30) The impoverished Macedonians along with the more affluent Corinthians shared with other congregations in Europe and Asia in supplying the needs of the congregations in Jerusalem and other parts of Judea. (2 Cor. 8:1-4; 9:1, 2) Today, when emergencies arise due to natural disasters, financial help makes it possible for clothing or other needs to be provided for the brothers in certain areas. Inasmuch as prevailing economic conditions are preventing some of our brothers from having adequate meeting places for the local congregations, the same spirit of giving moves us to support the arrangement to obtain Kingdom Halls. —Prov. 3:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> The present need of the brothers is quite different from previous needs just mentioned that have been cared for by generous contributions from others. The Society Kingdom Hall Fund does not pay outright for Kingdom Halls. That is not what the brothers need. Each congregation pays for its own Kingdom Hall. The Society Kingdom Hall Fund has been set up to provide adequate low-cost </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">financing</span><span class="font1"> for new Kingdom Hall construction or for obtaining and remodeling buildings to be used as Kingdom Halls. Monetary </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">loans</span><span class="font1"> are made to congregations under terms that allow the local brothers to make repayment without this becoming burdensome for any single congregation. So, the Society Kingdom Hall Fund holds potential benefits for the brothers everywhere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> Although we do not view Kingdom Halls in the same way that the tabernacle and the temple of Jehovah were viewed in ancient Israel, it is appropriate to give thought to the historical accounts that highlight the spirit of giving manifested by Jehovah’s worshipers during the time of those building projects long ago. So generous was the giving of materials for building the tabernacle that Moses had an announcement made throughout the camp of Israel telling the people not to “produce any more stuff for the holy contribution.”—Ex. 36:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> The same spirit was manifested by the Israelites in the days of David and Solomon. (1 Chron. 29:3-7) The Bible also makes mention of the fact that the people contributed joyfully and in a whole-souled manner. (1 Chron. 29:9) Many years later, when writing to the Corinthian congregation regarding their contribution for helping the needy Christians in Judea, Paul stated that the one that is generous in his sowing “will also reap bountifully.” He added, “Let each</span></p></li></ul><img src="okm_E_198504_files/okm_E_198504-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:212pt;height:143pt;">

<p><span class="font1">one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.”—2 Cor. 9:6, 7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> The world stands in sharp contrast. It manifests a “me first” attitude. Even among God’s own people, some have shown such a spirit. An example of this can be found in the book of Haggai. The repatriated Jews became so absorbed in their own personal affairs and in making a comfortable life for themselves that they neglected Jehovah’s worship. (Hag. 1:4, 9) Jehovah blessed neither their efforts nor the land. To readjust their thinking, Jehovah sent his prophet Haggai. By again putting their time, resources, and energy to work on Jehovah’s house, the Israelites once more experienced the great joy of generously giving and received rich blessings from Jehovah. The present urgent need for Kingdom Halls in this country gives Jehovah’s people today a marvelous opportunity to experience similar joy and blessings.—Mal. 3:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>HOW THE SOCIETY KINGDOM HALL FUND OPERATES</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> The Society Kingdom Hall Fund operates as a “revolving fund.” That is, contributions received are put into an account that is used solely for making </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">loans</span><span class="font1"> to assist congregations in the United States in financing their Kingdom Hall projects. While the moneys received are viewed as contributions to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund, they do not become a “gift” to complete a single Kingdom Hall project. Rather, the money loaned to congregations must be repaid. As this is done the accumulated repayments, along with continuing contributions from the congregations, are loaned to still other congregations for their building projects.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>10</sup> The costs of administering the fund, such as correspondence, legal details, banking, are all cared for by the Society. Therefore, each dollar contributed to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund is used exclusively for the purpose of providing funds for the loan pool to assist congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>11</sup> These loans are repaid to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund with interest at the rate of 6 percent. Why charge interest? Basically, the small amount of interest that is being charged serves to protect the contributions from inflation. Each year inflation erodes the purchasing power of every dollar, and the cost of building Kingdom Halls rises. The interest paid thus allows the Society Kingdom Hall Fund to maintain its potential for assisting congregations now and in the future.</span></p></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>WHO RECEIVES ASSISTANCE FROM THE SOCIETY KINGDOM HALL FUND?</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>12</sup> As stated in earlier issues of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font1"> only some of the most critical needs can be met at this time because of the present limited financial base of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. In 1983, the circuit overseers, assisted by qualified brothers in each circuit, completed a survey to determine which congregation in each circuit had the greatest need for a new Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>13</sup> But it should be kept in mind that just because a congregation is listed as the number one priority in the circuit, that congregation may not automatically qualify for assistance at this time. In other areas there may be congregations with an even greater need. Consideration is given to all the factors involved, and on the basis of such information the Society endeavors to apportion available funds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>14</sup> Congregations are cautioned not to “create” an emergency. For example, a congregation may have a facility that is small or overcrowded and so may wish to build or remodel, even though the present building is sound and appropriate in other respects. Unless the congregation is able, on its own, to finance the project, it would be premature to consider selling the present facility and assume that funds would be made available from the Society Kingdom Hall Fund to assist in completing a larger Kingdom Hall. Nor do we encourage borrowing money from brothers or financial institutions on a short-term basis, expecting that the Society will make funds available to cover these debts. No matter what may be planned with regard to Kingdom Hall financing and construction, the principle expressed at Luke 14:28-30 certainly ought to apply.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>15</sup> Are we saying that financing independently of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund should not be done? No. If a congregation chooses to use local financing, it may do so. However, this should not be done with the thought of refinancing through the Society Kingdom Hall Fund at a later date. Likewise, loan guarantees from the Society Kingdom Hall Fund are not available.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>16</sup> In some areas, congregations have been able to rent adequate facilities that can be used as a Kingdom Hall. While it may be advantageous to own property, there is no objection to renting property that is suitable for a Kingdom Hall. A lease, stating the responsibility of the property owner as well as the congregation, should be signed if at all possible.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM</span></h6>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>17</sup> No outside, commercial financing is involved in the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. Rather, Jehovah’s organization has placed before each one of us the opportunity to make regular contributions to this fund. Yes, our Christian generosity motivated by God’s spirit can fill much of the need for more Kingdom Halls.—Compare 2 Corinthians 9: 8-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>18</sup> Each congregation in the United States should have a contribution box designated for the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. Make sure that the location is convenient for all. If the congregation decides on a Kingdom Hall project, a building fund contribution box may be set up for that purpose. Such arrangement will allow the publishers to decide how they want their contribution to be used. We can be confident that Jehovah will bless our efforts to care for the needs of the many.—Heb. 6:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>19</sup> The congregation as a whole may desire to help meet the ever-growing need for more Kingdom Halls. If your own Kingdom Hall has been paid off, the congregation may decide to contribute to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund a certain amount each month. A resolution to this effect can be presented to the congregation. Upon approval, the moneys can be taken from the congregation’s cash account each month and remitted to the Society. Of course, any congregation may pass such a resolution, and the amount designated can be remitted along with the funds received from the contribution box for the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. This can be done monthly or as often as the congregation wishes.</span></p></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>LOCAL ASSISTANCE</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>20</sup> One suggestion for helping a local or nearby congregation to obtain an appropriate Kingdom Hall would be for a congregation to agree to assist with monthly mortgage payments. Obviously such an arrangement should never be solicited. However, nearby congregations or those with smaller or no mortgage payments may desire to help reduce the financial load on the congregations that will be using a new Kingdom Hall. If a nearby congregation should volunteer to do this, a written record should be prepared stating the amount of money that the congregation wishes to contribute each month and for how long they intend to make such monthly contributions. A copy of this written agreement should be kept in the files of each congregation involved. In one community, six congregations recognized that the brothers involved in a building project would find it extremely difficult to meet the necessary mortgage payments. They agreed, collectively, to equalize the mortgage payments among all congregations. Thus, all in the community benefited, and the brothers shared the financial burden.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>21</sup> In one metropolitan area an additional Kingdom Hall was badly needed. However, property costs involved hundreds of thousands of dollars. The three congregations were just unable to make the extremely high mortgage payment. Seven nearby congregations, although still paying for their own Kingdom Halls, arranged to assist on a monthly basis so that the needed Kingdom Hall could be provided.—See 2 Corinthians 8:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>22</sup> In many instances several congregations use the same Kingdom Hall. What can be done when one or more of such congregations find it necessary to obtain a Kingdom Hall in their own territory? The congregations that remain with the existing Kingdom Hall may wish to make a substantial contribution toward the new project. They may do this by borrowing money and donating the sum to the new Kingdom Hall project. (It should be kept in mind that such loans must be arranged for locally as the Society Kingdom Hall Fund has not been designed for this purpose.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>23</sup> In such instances, the congregation that decides to obtain its own Kingdom Hall should not assume that the remaining congregations are obligated to “buy their share” of the present facility from them. No congregation “owns” a share of the building that can be “sold” to congregations that continue to use the existing facility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>24</sup> Since the Society Kingdom Hall Fund has been functioning, loans have been made to help finance Kingdom Hall projects in 17 states. More loans are being approved as the funds become available. There is still much to be done by congregations either on their own or with available assistance from the Society Kingdom Hall Fund.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>25</sup> On the average, a new congregation is being established in this country every two and a half days. Each year the total number of new congregations formed taxes even further our present Kingdom Hall facilities. So, the challenge before all of us today includes not only meeting the need for adequate Kingdom Halls for existing congregations but doing what we can to keep pa£e with the accelerated growth in the number of new congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>26</sup> This matter of serious concern should be kept before Jehovah in earnest prayer. Individually and as congregations, we are called upon to assess our material resources and decide to what extent we will be able to support the Society Kingdom Hall Fund to help acquire needed Kingdom Hall facilities. The stepped-up pace of ingathering is in keeping with Jehovah’s timetable. He will certainly bless us in taking proper care of those hastening into his Kingdom organization during the final part of these last days.—Isa. 60: 8, 10, 11, 22.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>What Is the Need?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">In the United States, the last ten years has seen a 35-percent increase in the number of publishers and the formation of over 1,400 congregations. This growth now continues at an accelerated rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We are happy that thousands of fine Kingdom Halls have been built over the years. Jehovah's people have been diligent in making this possible. However, with the increase that is on, we face a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Over 300 circuits in this country have a need for at least one new Kingdom Hall. Many circuits have reported an immediate need for several new Kingdom Halls. In one large metropolitan area, 26 Kingdom Halls serve four or more congregations each. In such circumstances, one can readily appreciate the difficulties that arise during the visit of the circuit overseer, at Memorial time, and when the Kingdom Ministry School is being conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It has been found that in addition to the funds that have been raised locally, anywhere from 80 to 100 thousand dollars is often needed to complete a Kingdom Hall project. In some areas, a Kingdom Hall can be completed for 40 to 50 thousand dollars, but in other areas it may cost 100 thousand dollars or more just to buy the property on which to build a Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Based on those figures, you have some idea of what is needed in order to keep the Society Kingdom Hall Fund and the expansion program moving forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some of our brothers meet in damp basements or partially converted warehouses, and some are still meeting in the homes of the brothers. In other locations the only recourse the brothers have is to rent storefront locations. There are areas where the brothers can find no suitable place at all. They use community buildings or other facilities that are also used by worldly groups. Thus, for each meeting, they must bring in and remove all the equipment and literature necessary for the congregation's operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In still other areas the neighborhood has changed to such an extent that it is no longer a suitable area for a Kingdom Hall, and the congregation has to move. Some Kingdom Hall facilities have insufficient parking. Elsewhere brothers endeavor to deal with constant overcrowding, with some having to stand during the course of each meeting. Such undesirable conditions usually do not reflect favorably on the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While recognizing the magnitude of the task at hand, we must fully trust in Jehovah to help us meet the present need for Kingdom Halls.—Prov. 3:5, 6.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> During May and June our literature offer will be the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </span><span class="font12">From the time of its release at the “Kingdom Truth” conventions in 1982, this excellent Bible study aid has already brought spiritual encouragement and hope of life to millions of people around the earth. It is now available in 57 languages, and we can be confident that millions more will have opportunity to learn of Jehovah’s righteous New Order by means of this loving and timely provision.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Some months ago a reduced-size Spanish edition of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font12">book was released. This was done especially for the benefit of people living in economically disadvantaged countries, since it could be offered for a contribution of only half the cost. It has been received enthusiastically everywhere, not only by the public but also by our brothers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Now, an English reduced-size edition is available, and we will be using it in the regular literature offer during May and June. Congregations should have already placed their orders with the Society for this $1.25 edition. Any who have not yet ordered should do so at once.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">VARIOUS USES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Some of the brothers who have used the reduced-size book in the house-to-house ministry have offered it first. But they have had the regular edition with them to offer to persons who may have difficulty reading small print. Others have preferred working with the regular edition. Because the smaller edition is only $1.25, you may want to offer several copies to families with children or for use as gifts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The reduced-size book is particularly appreciated by publishers who may find it difficult to carry several of the larger publications. The smaller book will fit into a coat</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Teaching Ability in the House-to-House Ministry</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jesus was known as a preacher of the good news. (Luke 8:1) But more frequently he was addressed and referred to as a teacher. (Matt. 8:19; 9:11) The inspired account reports that “the crowds were astounded at his way of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">teaching,&quot; </span><span class="font12">and “he went round about to the villages in a circuit, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">teaching.&quot; </span><span class="font12">—Matt. 7:28; Mark 6:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Likewise, the apostles were teachers. According to Paul’s custom, he </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘reasoned</span><span class="font12"> with the people from the Scriptures, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">explaining </span><span class="font12">and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">proving</span><span class="font12"> by references’ what he ’was teaching them. (Acts 17:2, 3) He bore thorough witness concerning the Kingdom of God, using persuasion concerning Jesus. (Acts 28:23) What can we do to improve our teaching ability in the house-to-house ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BE ADAPTABLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> As we call from house to house, we meet people with greatly differing backgrounds and interests. Some profess a belief in the Bible, some do not. We must adapt our message to the individual householder. What did Jesus do when he spoke with a man “versed in the Law”? The man asked Jesus: “Teacher, by doing what shall I inherit everlasting life?” Jesus asked: “What is written in the Law? How do you read?” (Luke 10: 25-28) He recognized that the man was “versed in the Law” and his reply acknowledged that.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> When Paul preached at the Areopagus, he appreciated that he was speaking to Gentiles who had little or no knowledge of the Hebrew Scriptures or of Jesus Christ. So he explained things accordingly. (Acts 17:22-34) Similarly, we must take into consideration the person with whom we talk. If we speak with a youth, we should explain things on a level that he will understand. If we speak to a Bible reader, we need to adjust to the situation, just as Jesus did with the man “versed in the Law.” Because each person we speak to is different, each presentation we make will likely be somewhat varied. What else can we do to be effective teachers in the house-to-house ministry?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REASON WITH PEOPLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> To reason means to present the message in such a manner as to help the householder to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">understand </span><span class="font12">and to arrive at the same conclusion that we do. This requires </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">explaining</span><span class="font12"> points thoroughly, so that the householder not only will listen but will see the reasonableness of our presentation. How can we explain points effectively?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> The question </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font12"> calls for reasons. Each householder is fully justified in asking </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font12"> we call on him, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font12"> our message is so urgent, and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font12"> he should believe it. Therefore, ask yourself these same questions when you prepare for the house-to-house ministry. For example, our current Topic for Conversation is “Are We Facing Armageddon?” We could ask ourselves: Why are we talking to the people about this subject? Why is God bringing this war? Why are we so sure this is going to happen? Why do I believe in the book of Revelation? And if we are going to use additional scriptures, why are we going to read them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> Once we know the answers to these questions, we will want to explain things in such a way that the householder will gain understanding. Remember, Paul used “references” to explain the Scriptures. —Acts 17:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Illustrations and appropriate questions are very helpful. They make people think on truths and help develop heart appreciation. As we read the Scriptures, give proper emphasis to key words. This helps people to think on what is read. In this regard, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">School Guidebook </span><span class="font12">offers many specific suggestions in studies 10, 15, 25, 31, and 34. Take time to consider those suggestions, and put them into practice as you share in the house-to-house ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Having the responsibility for teaching people all the things Jesus commanded us should motivate us to consider seriously the need to ‘pay constant attention to our teaching.’ (1 Tim. 4:16) Learning how to teach requires time and effort on our part. Paul told Timothy that those who “work hard in speaking and teaching” are “reckoned worthy of double honor.” (1 Tim. 5:17) Do not hesitate to request the assistance of the elders and other qualified publishers. Constantly pray that Jehovah will bless us as we continue to ‘apply ourselves to teaching.’—1 Tim. 4:13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">RESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In High-Crime Areas</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Crime and violence are increasing at an alarming rate. This is in fulfillment of Paul’s words recorded at 2 Timothy 3:1: “But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.” In some places it is unsafe to walk the streets alone, even in broad daylight. In order to share fully in the preaching and disciple-making work in high-crime areas, caution and good judgment are needed. (Matt. 10:16) We must demonstrate “practical wisdom” and ‘soundness of mind.’—Prov. 3:21; 1 Pet. 4:7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AVOID DIFFICULTIES WHERE POSSIBLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Avoid questionable situations as much as possible while in the field ministry. The Bible says: “The shrewd one considers his steps.” (Prov. 14:15) It also counsels: “Before the quarrel has burst forth, take your leave.” (Prov. 17:14) To consider your steps shrewdly will involve avoiding places where danger is likely. For instance, when working in the evenings, wherever possible use well-lighted, well-traveled streets, rather than poorly lit and infrequently traveled ones. Also, avoid bands of youths loitering on street corners, perhaps crossing to the other side of the street before coming to them. It is not shrewd to wear costly looking clothing or jewelry if you are in a high-crime area.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> When working in the field ministry where it is not wise to be alone, it is suggested that you arrange for another publisher to accompany you. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(om</span><span class="font12"> p. 104) When witnessing in apartment buildings, it may be advantageous to have several publishers working on the same floor, with brothers taking the lead when available. Use discernment before accepting invitations to enter homes or apartments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Live Forever &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">pocket or purse for informal witnessing opportunities, as at work or at school. It may be sent more economically through the mail as a gift to someone living in another area. Now that the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book is being used in the Theocratic Ministry School, some may find this new edition more convenient for carrying to the congregation meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> But whether you use the regular or the reduced-size book, be pre-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT TO DO IF CONFRONTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> If you are confronted, how should you react? Do not panic. Immediately identify yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and endeavor to remain calm. Demonstrate mildness and pray to Jehovah for direction and protection. (Prov. 15:1; Gal. 5:22, 23) Another Bible principle to remember during such a time is, as stated by Jesus Christ, that a person’s “life does not result from the things he possesses.” (Luke 12:15) With the increase of crime, there is an ever greater possibility of being confronted at gunpoint or knifepoint by a person demanding your money. Will you fight to save your money? Your life is of far more value than material possessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">. <sup>5</sup> A brother was held up one night by several young men. He immediately gave them his wallet and watch. In addition they asked him for his gold chain. The brother calmly answered that he did not wear a gold chain or an amulet because he was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Upon hearing this, the men quickly returned his possessions and asked for his forgiveness. True are the words of Proverbs 18:10: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Into it the righteous runs and is given protection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> There are still many honest-hearted persons who have a love for righteousness and who are looking for the truth. Some of these persons live in areas where there is a high crime rate. They need to be contacted in the ministry and directed to Jehovah’s organization. If we have high-crime areas in our territory assignment, we will want to put forth an earnest effort to reach the honest-hearted ones living there, while also demonstrating good judgment, looking to Jehovah for guidance and protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">pared to place </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</span><span class="font12"> whenever you have opportunity. Jehovah’s angels are still gathering out those whom he will protect through the impending great tribulation. (Rev. 14:6, 7) By our zealous participation in distributing this excellent Bible study aid, we may be able to help still others to find the way of salvation and, in doing so, gain Jehovah’s favor for ourselves. —1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>

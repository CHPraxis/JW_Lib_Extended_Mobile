</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> What a joyful privilege it is to share regularly in proclaiming the message of salvation! How richly blessed we are to bear this message to others! As we share this good news of salvation, our own faith and zeal are strengthened. Our hearts rejoice as we heed the exhortation to “sing to Jehovah, bless his name.&quot;—Ps. 96:2-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Are you making it your goal to speak the message of salvation </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">every day?</span><span class="font12"> Those who engage in the auxiliary or the regular pioneer work usually have a daily share in telling the good news. Could you do this? If not, could you at least have some share, even a small informal share, each day? What a grand shout of praise to Jehovah would result if all of us could do this! You will experience Jehovah’s good pleasure and many other rich blessings as you proclaim the Kingdom hope each day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Our attitude toward the ministry can influence how often we share the good news with others. We must not become discouraged and slow down in presenting the Kingdom message due to a lack of response on the part of people. Rather, a positive attitude and keen appreciation for the message</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Pioneer This Summer?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Can you share in the pioneer service this summer? It is encouraging to see how many are adjusting their affairs to have a part in the auxiliary and the regular pioneer service, with some reaching out for still other privileges of full-time service, such as serving as a missionary or at Bethel.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CAN YOU?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah knew that as his people became imitators of him and his Son during this time of the end, they would devote themselves to their God-assigned work of Kingdom preaching. (Matt. 24:14; Mark 13:10; see also John 4:34; 5:17.) The psalmist said that ‘Jehovah’s people would offer themselves willingly’ as He gathers them for this important work. (Ps. 110:3) Psalm 68:11 describes the women telling the good news as “a large army.” And it has proved to be just that way with Jehovah’s people today. More people ^than ever before, including men, women, and youths, are now sharing in the work of Kingdom preaching. More are participating in the auxiliary pioneer work. There of salvation can strengthen our endeavor to share daily in telling the good news.—Luke 6:45.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> As family members work together unitedly in ‘ascribing glory and strength’ to Jehovah, many rich blessings can be enjoyed. (Ps. 96:7) Both family and spiritual bonds are strengthened when time is scheduled to work in the ministry as a family. Special field service days, such as the first Sunday and the second and fourth Saturdays of the month, provide excellent opportunities for family members to work together along with other families in the congregation in telling the Kingdom hope.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> During June we will be offering the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font12"> book, both the regular and the reduced-size editions. People are concerned about day-to-day living and desire a happy future. Honest-hearted persons rejoice to learn about the prospect of long life without the problems so common to mankind today. Accurate knowledge of this hope, and faith in its soon becoming a reality, should stir us to positive action in presenting the Kingdom message.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">have never been more serving in the regular pioneer work or in Bethel service. More and more are giving heed to Jesus’ counsel to serve with our “whole heart, mind, and soul,’ and are delighted to be doing just that.—Matt. 22:37.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Satan and his system of things tend to make life complicated and would keep us so fully occupied that we would have little or no time for Kingdom interests. (1 Cor. 15:58) Jesus counseled, ‘If your eye is simple, your whole body will be bright.’ (Matt. 6:22) Could you adjust your affairs so that your view, your goals, and your life become simpler, less complicated? As you adjust your affairs to concentrate more on promoting Kingdom interests, you will find that you will reflect enlightenment that glorifies God and benefits fellow humans.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12">NOTE: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Each congregation may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the district convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 109</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Local announcements and Announcements from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Subjecting Ourselves to Jehovah by Dedication.” Talk on article in June 1, 1985, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font12">pages 29-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">20 </span><span class="font12">min: “Daily Tell the Good News of Salvation.” Questions and answers. Brief demonstration of portion of family practice session with one member of family giving simple presentation from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font12"> to another member of family. Encourage all to share in magazine work on second Saturday as well as house-to-house work with the offer on Sunday, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 129 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 91</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">10 min: Local announcements and accounts report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">20 min: Teach With the Use of the Magazines. Audience discussion and demonstrations. How can we use the art of teaching in presenting the magazines? Emphasize the fundamentals of good teaching: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reliance on Jehovah.</span><span class="font12"> (2 min.) Remember our message is from Jehovah; promote God’s interests and not our own. Direct attention to the Bible and its message of Kingdom good news; this is vital in reaching hearts. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span><span class="font12"> (2 min.) We can teach someone else only what we know. Do you read the magazines? We all need to. As you read them take particular note of points that may interest the people you meet. Which articles or points will interest a man, a woman, a child, a professional person, or someone unemployed? Try to present these points in your own words. Anticipate the interests and objections of the householder. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Questions.</span><span class="font12"> (2 min.) Well-phrased questions can be very effective in capturing the interest of people and drawing attention to the article you wish to feature in your presentation. Effective use of questions will help you to teach and to stimulate interest. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Illustrations. </span><span class="font12">(2 min.) Jesus taught by using word pictures. (Matt. 13:34, 35) The magazines contain actual pictures that graphically illustrate major points or lessons discussed in the material. Calling attention to these pictures involves both hearing and seeing, enhancing the effectiveness of your teaching. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Repetition.</span><span class="font12"> (2 min.) Regularly returning with the latest issues may progressively help the householder to learn more about the Kingdom hope. It may also help you to build a rapport with the householder that could lead to a Bible study, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(sg </span><span class="font12">pp. 49-54)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(9 min.) Two demonstrations. Have experienced publisher(s) demonstrate 30- to 60-second presentations of the current magazines. In first demonstration, feature </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and in the second demonstration, feature </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> Encourage audience to observe closely. After each presentation, ask audience to comment on how the teaching techniques previously discussed were used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(1 min.) Chairman encourages all to apply points discussed. We spend much time in the field service offering magazines. To accomplish the most, we should all try progressively to improve our ability to teach with the use of magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">“Can You Pioneer This Summer?” Questions and answers. Read key paragraphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 12 and concluding prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEK STARTING JUNE 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">8 mln: </span><span class="font12">Local announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: Use for local needs or talk on “Never Forget You Are a Witness!” in June 1, 1984, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font12">pages 20-5. Emphasize points under subheadings “Using Our Time to Help Others” and “Be Alert to Informal Witnessing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">15 min: “Keep Assisting One Another.” Questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">7 mln: Field service for the weekend. Encourage all to share in magazine witnessing on the fourth Saturday of the month. Draw attention to articles in current issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> that would appeal to various people in the congregation’s territory. Demonstrate 30- to 60-second presentation of current magazines, featuring an appropriate article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Song 216 and concluding prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">20 min: “Presenting the Good News —To All People.” Questions and answers.

As time permits, entertain comments of publishers concerning their efforts to reach all people with the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Be alert to share the good news with others while traveling to the district convention and while in the convention city. Ask congregation to mention opportunities when this might be done. Then ask for suggestions on the type of approach that might bring good results. Take literature with you. Note time spent and placements made so they can be reported at end of month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font12">Presenting the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Survival </span><span class="font12">Book in July. Suggest appropriate talking points, such as the titles of the first seven chapters or the first paragraph of each of these chapters. Pictures on pages 4, 5, 33, and 41 might be used. Prepared publisher demonstrates use of Topic for Conversation and features paragraph 1 of chapter 3 in offering the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Survival </span><span class="font12">book. Publisher places book in householder’s hands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul wrote, “Through love slave for one another.” (Gal. 5:13) This statement re.-fleets the spirit that should govern our relationships with others, both inside—and—outside the Christian congregation. Our genuine concern for others causes us to take_the ini-tiatiye in helping new and weaker ones who are associated with us. There are those who are making steady progress in coming to an accurate knowledge of the truth; they^too, need assistance. Our loving personal interest extends also to those in ofir congregation who may have special needs.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Situations may arise that call for us to be persistent in aiding those who have special needs'; due to their circumstances. Tireless efforts are especially needed when assisting one who has grown old or when helping an individual or a family affected by long-term illness. The aged or sick one and perhaps other members of the family may need encouragement. Regular visits can lift up their spirits and build endurance. Telephone calls and cards are much appreciated by such persons. A friendly smile and a brief word of encouragement will assure our brothers that we care. (Prov. 25:11) There may be a need 4 to prepare meals, run errands,*or do housework to help those family members who must cope with such<sup>1</sup> ' adversity while seeking to carry on their normal daily routine and to have a regular share in the witness work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Endeavor to discern the true needs of others, and then act accordingly. (1 John 3:16-18) Your book study conductor is usually well acquainted with those assigned to the group, so seek his direction and advice. Unselfish brotherly love can stir ‘each of us to please his neighbor in what is good for his </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">upbuildin</span><span class="font12">g.’ (Rom. 15:1, 2) As we endeavor to care for ourselves and ‘those who are our own’ in whatever situation we find ourselves, we draw courage and strengthen our hope, knowing that Je</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">hovah cares for us</span><span class="font12"> and will bless Us as we keep assisting one another.—1 Tim. 5:8; 1 Pet. 5:6, 7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jesus Christ gave the Kingdom of God wide publicity. He went throughout the whole of Galilee proclaiming: “Repent, you people, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” (Matt. 4:17) This was a timely message of good news that warmed the hearts of Jesus’ listeners and gave them hope. Such good news had to be shared with others, and because of its urgency, those doing this work carried a weighty responsibility.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Who has accepted this responsibility? At the beginning of our Common Era it was the disciples of Jesus, including the faithful apostles. Centuries later we have been made aware of this message, and so we too have the responsibility of sharing it with others. (1 Cor. 9:16) By taking advantage of all appropriate opportunities, we can show our heartfelt obedience to Jesus’ command to preach the &quot;good news of the kingdom ... in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations” before the end comes.—Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> When sharing in the house-to-house work, do we make an effort to contact someone at every home? With so many people working secularly, there may be no response at many doors. Of course, a lack of response at the front door does not always mean that no one is at home. Are there indications that they use a side or back entrance? If so, a knock there may bring a response. Or it may be that the householder is in the backyard or garage. Sometimes you will And a separate apartment with an entrance at the side of the house. After going on to other homes, you may see the householder return. Should this prove to be the case, after a few minutes, why not go back and knock again?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> What about homes where you are unable to contact anyone? Note these on your House-to-House Record. Usually it is best to keep a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">separate</span><span class="font12"> record of interested persons you plan to visit again so that the list of not-at-homes can be passed on to someone else if you are unable to return. When following up not-at-homes, many have found it good to call at different times, as this may increase the possibility of finding someone. Some publishers have been successful in reaching people by calling later the same day or in the evening. People not at home during the week are often there on the weekend and vice versa. Groups that do weekday and weekend witnessing may exchange their lists of not-at-homes and find they get good results in reaching some of these people. Our faithfulness in keeping this record and following it up demonstrates our love for others and our desire to please Jehovah.—Luke 16:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Be prepared to take advantage of other opportunities to witness while in the territory. For example, you may encounter individuals out for a stroll, or they may be sitting on a bench or waiting for a bus. By using a tactful approach along with a friendly smile, you may get a listening ear. Also, it is good to call at small stores and business establishments if they are not unusually busy. Very often you will encounter youths in the course of your ministry. Do not pass up an opportunity to share a Scriptural thought with them, because their lives are important too.—Matt. 19:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> God’s Word makes it clear that it is Jehovah’s ‘will that all sorts of people be saved.’ (1 Tim. 2:4) “He does not desire </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font12"> to be destroyed but desires </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font12"> to attain to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9) When we work our assigned territory thoroughly and make a sincere effort to contact everyone, we show that we love others as Jehovah does. That spirit is sure to result in blessings to us and to those who listen to us.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>

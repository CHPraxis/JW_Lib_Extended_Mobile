<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Honor of Bearing Jehovah’s Name</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> What an honor to bear the name Jehovah’s Witnesses! We rejoice to know Jehovah and to be recognized by him as individuals who respect his name and obey his laws. Are we not proud to be among the relatively few persons on earth who have taken their stand on the side of the Greatest Personage of the universe?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> To bear God’s name worthily, we must show we understand clearly what that name involves. For one thing, we acknowledge Jehovah as the Great Purposer. What he says comes to pass. (Isa. 55:11) The Bible shows his objectives have always been fully accomplished. Hence, we have absolute confidence that his purposes for the future will be fully realized. To demonstrate our confidence, we should use our lives in support of his arrangements. This confirms our faith and assures us of his blessing.—Matt. 7:21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Bearing Jehovah’s name also means recognizing and loving his qualities. When we hear his name we think of his mercy, graciousness, patience, loving-kindness, and truth. (Ex. 34:6) Primarily he is a</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Following Up the Interest We Find</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When giving final instructions to his faithful followers, Jesus said: “Go . . . make disciples . . . teaching them.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) With these words Jesus impressed upon his disciples that they were to do a teaching work. This would necessitate making return visits on people to cultivate their interest.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW IS THIS DONE?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Some brothers have found it difficult to engage in this feature of the preaching work. Sometimes it is because of uncertainty about the approach to use when calling back. However, it is not that difficult. Usually it is best to start planning what you will say on a return visit immediately after you conclude your first visit. Write down points that interested the householder. This will give you a common ground on which to build. Call back within a few days if possible. If weeks go by, the householder’s interest may cool and will be more difficult to rekindle. Keep your presentation simple, clear, and to the point. Use the Bible to back up what you say. Avoid controversial subjects. Highlight the appealing aspects of the Kingdom message.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">God of love. Jesus said he made Jehovah’s name known to his followers. Why? So that they could experience God’s love. (John 17:26) So, bearing His name worthily includes imitating Jesus and manifesting his qualities in our lives.—John 13:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EFFECTS OF</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BEARING HIS NAME WORTHILY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> When we serve Jehovah whole-souled, positive effects are observable to others. They see us as happy, fearless people united in true worship in all countries. We are free from addictive drugs and immoral practices. Our families and marriages are, for the most part, happy as a result of applying Scriptural principles. Many employers prefer to have Jehovah’s Witnesses work for them because they are honest and do not steal, cheat, or lie. Many have made public statements commending us because they see we are different from others in the world. (See w83 6/1 p. 10; w83 10/1 p. 7; p8110/8 p. 14.) Our Christian conduct draws sincere people to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> But the greatest testimony to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Your presentation should not be one-sided. Success often depends on getting the householder involved. Use viewpoint questions to learn what he is thinking. This enables you to do meaningful teaching.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AVAILABLE HELP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Of course, some of us need help in developing our teaching ability on return visits. Such help is usually available. Almost all of us know someone who is capable in witnessing on return visits. The service overseer is anxious to share what he has found to be successful. Your study conductor may be able to assist. Ask him if he can accompany you on some of your calls. Or, perhaps it is just a matter of getting help in preparing what to say. These experienced publishers can show you what methods they have used to get good results. Remember Jesus took time to teach his disciples. They were instructed by him prior to their setting out to preach. (Matt. 10:5-15; Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6) Instructions similar to those provided by Jesus are available through Jehovah’s organization today.</span></p></li></ul>

Extend hospitality so as to get to know one another better. (Rom. 12:13) Do some need help in field service? Could you offer to help them? Look for opportunities to assist older ones in loving ways; mothers with children who may need help in caring for their children so that they may share in the field service; some who are spiritually low and need to be strengthened, and so forth. Commend brothers for what they are doing and recommend that they keep on abounding in love toward one another. (Material in chapter 17 of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">United in Worship</span><span class="font13"> book may be helpful in preparing talk.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">our respect for Jehovah’s name is our preaching the good news of his Kingdom. Encouraging reports from all over the world show that God’s people are zealously sharing in this preaching work. More and more are reaching out for auxiliary and regular pioneer service. Have you experienced the joy of such service? If not, could you do so sometime during this year? What a fine opportunity this provides to speak to a greater number of people about God’s name and purpose.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Do not feel disheartened if your circumstances prevent you from doing as much as others who are physically stronger and less encumbered. Jehovah’s name is honored when each person does the best he can with what he has. The spirit of wholeheartedness in preaching shows that we appreciate God’s love and that we desire to honor him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFER SUBSCRIPTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> A tremendous aid to us in making Jehovah’s name known to others is the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> magazine. For the past 105 years it has been used to announce Jehovah’s Kingdom. It is a powerful instrument that we can use during January and February. During these months we will offer the subscription for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> for $4. We could also offer a subscription for both </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> for 88. Emphasize the value of the Scriptural knowledge in these magazines as you present them. Your enthusiasm may move spiritually inclined ones to subscribe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Those who do subscribe or take individual copies can learn more about Jehovah and hopefully they too will eventually have the honor of bearing Jehovah’s name.—Rom. 10:13.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> Our goal in this wicked “time of the end” is to be able to say, as did faithful King David, “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity,” and “as for me, in my integrity I shall walk.” (Ps. 26:1, 11) Truly this quality is vitally necessary now in view of the critical times in which we are living. What a joy it is to know that integrity keepers have the assurance of Jehovah’s help and protection during this time as promised at Proverbs 2:7, </span><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Fok</span><span class="font15"> those walking in integrity he is a shield.” (Compare Proverbs 10:9; 14:32.) In view of this, how can we individually resolve to build and also walk in our integrity in practical ways so that we can say as did Job, “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself”? (Job 27:5) One excellent provision to assist us in maintaining our integrity is our forthcoming 1985 “Integrity Keepers” Convention. Last summer there was an all-time peak attendance of 1,159,898 in the contiguous United States. What a blessing it will be this summer to be in attendance with even more of our brothers and sisters at well over 100 conventions in this country.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>2</sup> By now your congregation has received a letter from the Society, dated December 10, 1984, informing you of the convention you are assigned to attend. By cooperating with these arrangements, the congregations will help the convention organization in its efforts to provide sufficient seats and food for everyone. To assist you in making the necessary arrangements, the information that follows is being provided. As you make your plans to be in attendance, lovingly include others who need assistance, especially newly interested ones, so they can attend every session as well. (Gal. 6:10) The program will start at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING ARRANGEMENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>3</sup> You should make your own rooming arrangements directly with the hotel or motel by using the information provided by the convention through your congregation. In most cases you will pay a great deal less than the regular rates charged by the hotel or motel, since the convention has negotiated for a large number of good quality rooms. These rooms will be assigned by the hotel or motel only to those identifying themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses, or as delegates attending the Watchtower Convention. By the middle of December 1984 your congregation should have received a list of hotels and motels in the convention city that are cooperating closely with the Society’s rooming arrangement. It shows the address of the facility, its agreed-upon rates, and the phone number to be used in making your reservations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: </span><span class="font15">As soon as your congregation receives the list of hotels and motels that the convention organization provides, you should IMMEDIATELY phone the hotel or motel of your choice, identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower Convention. Doing'so will qualify you for the agreed-upon rates listed. One night’s DEPOSIT will be required at all locations to hold the room, and the deposit should be sent directly to the hotel or motel </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">as soon as</span><span class="font15"> you make your reservations. Do not make rooming arrangements you do not intend to keep. (Matt. 5:37) </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Motels or hotels are not obligated to hold the rooms or extend the special rates beyond the cutoff date without a deposit.</span><span class="font15"> If you find it necessary to cancel your accommodations, you should write or phone the hotel or motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. This makes the room available for other dele-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">gates who need accommodations. The convention Rooming Department will monitor the arrangement and, through the congregation, will provide additional information such as which hotels or motels are filled after a month or two, as well as any additional ones it may find necessary to add to the list. If the hotel or motel you call first is filled, then call your next selection from the list, and so on.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> DORMITORIES: </span><span class="font15">A few conventions use school dormitories in order to accommodate all those attending. Usually congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first hotel or motel listing. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow through in accord with the instructions on the list that is sent to the congregations by the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> SPECIAL NEEDS: </span><span class="font15">Arrangements to care for those with special needs should be made by the congregation where these attend. Elders and others aware of such circumstances can lovingly extend help. This often involves taking others with them in their own group, for example, those in full-time service, the elderly, the infirm, the deaf, or others. Also, they may care for such ones in other ways. (Acts 20:35; Jas. 2:15-17; 1 John 3:17, 18) We are confident that loving concern will be shown to all who need our help. (2 Cor. 6: 11-13; John 13:35; Gal. 6:10) However, the convention Rooming Department will endeavor to provide rooming accommodations for those with special needs who are unable to care for themselves, or cannot be cared for by those in the congregation where they attend. These may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for a Special Needs Room Request Form, discussing their situation with him at that time. Those with special needs are the only ones that should use this form. They should fill it out and return it to the convention coordinator to be checked for completeness, accuracy and verification of circumstances. Even though the convention coordinator forwards the form to the convention Rooming Department, the individual will be notified directly of the accommodations by the Rooming Department. This should be done well ahead of the convention. The publisher with special needs should NOT simply go to the convention and request a room when he arrives, because the convention Rooming Department needs the verification of the congregation’s convention coordinator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>7</sup> Private home accommodations listed by the convention are usually set aside for those who have limited funds and who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not available. They are not intended for those who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money. Nor is it proper for delegates to presume upon the hospitality of our brothers by expecting to be accommodated extra days so they can visit vacation spots or do other things before or after the convention. These rooms are for the convention period only.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> DELEGATES ATTENDING FROM OUTSIDE THE ASSIGNED AREA: </span><span class="font15">To reduce travel, district conventions are arranged at many locations. In nearly every case, the location assigned for you to attend is the one nearest to your congregation. Seating, literature, food orders, and so forth, are planned on the premise that the majority will attend the convention to which they are assigned. However, if for some reason you will be attending a location other than the one assigned, you may ask the convention coordinator in your congregation for the address of the convention headquarters where you will attend. He will find these addresses listed on the back of the Special Needs Room Request Form. Unless persons have special needs, they should </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font15"> use the Special Needs Room Request Form. Rather, they should write to the convention headquarters where they wish to attend and request a copy of the hotel or motel listing for that location, sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope along with this request. Upon receipt of this listing of hotels and motels, they should proceed just as if they were using the list for their local area.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> YOUR COOPERATION NEEDED: </span><span class="font15">The smoothness and the success with which this rooming arrangement functions depend largely on the cooperation of everyone involved. For instance, if a number of delegates run ahead and make reservations on their own before the congregation receives the list of facilities that are cooperating with the convention Rooming Department, it can cause a major breakdown in negotiations. The same is true if a number of delegates choose to make their own arrangements with facilities not listed because they have not cooperated with the convention rooming arrangement. As an example, a motel across the street from the convention site may not lower its rates, possibly even raising them for the convention, and so the convention Rooming Department advises the motel management that the motel will not be put on the list and thus will not get our business. However, if brothers go ahead and accept these higher rates and fill this motel, even though it is not listed, then that motel may never lower its rates. In turn, the management of other motels or hotels may be encouraged to hold out for higher prices. The conventions are working to save all our brothers as much expense as possible, and so it is in the best interest of all for everyone to cooperate fully with the Society’s rooming arrangement. The listing is broad enough to give a choice of good quality accommodations and yet give preference to the hotels or motels that cooperate. Our aim with this rooming arrangement is to help delegates to be accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible, so they will be refreshed and fully able to enjoy the fine spiritual program.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SIGN LANGUAGE SESSIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>10</sup> As shown in the accompanying chart, sign language translation will be provided </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font15"> at 16 specific convention cities. </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(No </span><span class="font15">provision will be made at any other conventions for sign language.) We know this will prove to be a real blessing to those with this special need by providing good quality translating and larger groups with which to enjoy upbuilding fellowship. Those who are signers can do much to let the deaf in their congregation know of the arrangements and help them to attend where the sign language provision is made by the Society.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Highlighting the need for more Christian ministers, Jesus said, “The harvest is great, but the workers are few.” While this was true in Jesus’ day, there is an even greater need now in this time of the end. Therefore, in obedience to Jesus’ command, we “beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”—Matt. 9:37, 38.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HELP NEEDED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> While we are far along into the harvest, it is not yet completed. Jehovah God continues to bless our ministry with fine increases in the field, and it is a challenge to train the new ones. (Matt. 28:20) Most congregations in this country are covering their assigned territory regularly, but a few still need help. There are some territories not currently assigned to any congregations. There is still an urgent need for more workers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> There is also a great need to strengthen some congregations spiritually. Elders, ministerial servants, strong Christian families, and pioneers could be used in a number of congregations. When willing workers of this type are added to a congregation, the brothers are strengthened, and expansion is often the result.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW CAN THESE NEEDS BE FILLED?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> First, in the congregations needing help, it would be good for the elders to analyze the circumstances. What are the local needs? What can those now in the congregations do to fill these needs? Could some increase their activity in the field service? Could more serve as auxiliary or regular pioneers? Are also notes: “Not only will its subheadings offer you a ready-to-use outline, but the wide selection of scriptures quoted will make it possible for you to have variety and freshness in your presentation.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> So there is every reason to be positive in following up the interest we find in our preaching work, even if we have only limited experience. The important thing is that we care about others. Jehovah’s organization today has provided literature and experienced publishers for our training. When we find sincere persons who are “sighing and groaning” over the bad things they see, our love should move us to return and help them.—Ezek. 9:4-6. the baptized brothers reaching out and being used to their full potential? Is it possible for the elders and ministerial servants to set an even better example in zeal for the ministry? Would more warm, loving encouragement and commendation stir some in the congregations to greater activity?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Next, talk to the circuit overseer about the situation. He may have meaningful suggestions as to what can be done within the congregation to meet local needs. Or he may know of other congregations or pioneers in the circuit who could render help. If so, he can put them in contact with you. Where no assistance is available within the circuit, the circuit overseer or the local elders may write to the Society outlining the circumstances and needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> If your congregation is covering its territory often or if there are sufficient elders, ministerial servants, or pioneers to care for the local needs, could some make themselves available to help elsewhere? Individuals and family groups would do well to review their own spiritual gifts, assets, and potential. Would it be possible to take a temporary assignment to work unassigned territory or perhaps move to help a congregation permanently where the workers are few?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> To those who can take a temporary assignment or make a permanent move, it is recommended that they write a letter to the Society, making known their availability. Such a letter should be given to the Congregation Service Committee so they may add their recommendation and mail it to the Society.—See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Ministry,</span><span class="font13"> pages 112, 113 and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> of May 1982, page 7, paragraph 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> Before moving, it is very wise to count the cost. (Luke 14:28) Remember, in most areas where help is needed the towns are small, secular </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">work is often scarce,</span><span class="font13"> and you may not always have others to work with in service. You may have frequent parts on meetings, and the qualit</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">y of meetings m</span><span class="font13">ay not be what you are used to. A sincere desire to help and an intense love for your brothers are essential. An appreciation of what it means to be selfsacrificing is a must. Do you qualify? The need is there! Are you available?—Isa. 6:8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In Business Territory</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The account at Acts 17:17 says that Paul “began to reason in the synagogue with the Jews and the other people who worshiped God and every day in the marketplace with those who happened to be on hand.” His preaching in the marketplace and in other locations clearly demonstrated his heartfelt desire to reach people with the Kingdom hope, wherever they could be found. This was true even when the circumstances seemed less than favorable. For example, his preaching in the marketplace, in the account referred to above, resulted in his being led to the Areopagus where he made a marvelous defense of his faith. On that occasion many, including Dionysius, a judge, were moved to embrace Christianity.—Acts 17:15-34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Can we expect similar results when preaching to those in business territory? Yes! In fact one sister who called on the owner of a restaurant with the brochure </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!</span><span class="font13"> sparked his interest in the truth, resulting in a regular Bible study at his restaurant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Yet, in spite of the success that many have had in this feature of the ministry, some publishers are inclined to feel that witnessing to storekeepers would be extremely difficult. One publisher who took this view said, “I expected that the response would be negative. However, to my surprise, their reaction to the Kingdom message was just the opposite! They were genuinely polite and friendly and almost always accepted the magazines.” Yes, those who have shared in working business territory speak of it as a fruitful work that brings blessings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Elders, especially the service overseer, should encourage experienced publishers to work business territory. Those who participate should endeavor to be brief and to the point when contacting business people since their time may be limited. Many have found it practical to</span></p></li></ul>

One sister writes: “We entered the stores or businesses when no customers were present and quickly showed the current magazines or the brochure. The interest was such that we had placed all our magazines within two blocks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT SHOULD WE SAY?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> It is appropriate to ask for the manager or the person in charge. Using a simple approach, explain the reason for calling. For example, after introducing yourself, you could say, “Since it is often very difficult to find business people at home, we are making this effort to contact you here. In the latest issue </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">of.The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> there is this article entitled [give title] that contains information that personally affects you. We know you will enjoy reading this article as well as the others. We offer it along with </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> for a contribution of only 40 cents.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> One pioneer brother periodically places magazines with the local police department. Imagine his reaction when the police, after having accepted the April 22,1984, issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font13"> contacted him and requested 500 copies! They planned to use the article “My Child Is Missing!” in connection with fingerprinting the children in their town. However, it did not end there. When the police department of a nearby community heard of the article, they contacted another pioneer brother and requested 400 copies of the same issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Witnessing in business territory affords us an opportunity to reach persons who are rarely contacted in the door-to-door work. So be alert to such opportunities. Fine results have come from working business territory!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> As insecurity increases in the world around us, it is urgent that we become and remain stabilized in the faith. (Isa. 57:20, 21; 1 John 5:4) Accordingly, it is most fitting that the circuit assembly program beginning in February 1985 will develop the theme “Be Stabilized in the Faith.”—Col. 2:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> This new program will highlight the need for all to become steadfast, mature Christians. It will help us appreciate just what is required to maintain balance as Christians living in the midst of the world but being no part of it. (John 17:14) None of us can afford to miss this pointed and practical program. —Matt. 24:45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Begin early to make your plans to attend. As soon as the dates and location for your assembly are announced, arrange your affairs so that you can be present both days. Encourage Bible students to come with you. Everyone attending is sure to be rewarded spiritually and strengthened to stand “solid in the faith.”—1 Pet. 5:9.</span></p></li></ul>

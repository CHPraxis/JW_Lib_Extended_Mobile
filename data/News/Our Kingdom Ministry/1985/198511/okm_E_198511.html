<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> How long have you maintained your zeal in preaching the good news? Five years, ten, or even longer? Some brothers have preached twenty, thirty, or more years and are still going strong. What is it that has kept them from tiring out? How can we keep pace with Jehovah’s organization and the work that he is ‘speeding up in its own time’?—Isa. 60:22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REFLECT JEHOVAH'S ZEAL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Those who engage in Kingdom service properly view themselves as God’s fellow workers. (1 Cor. 3:9) They see his zeal for righteousness and imitate it. Jehovah first announced the good news thousands of years ago, and he has zealously followed through to see that it is declared by his people. (Gal. 3:8) Even at this late date in human history, Jehovah has not lost interest in his Kingdom purpose. Rather, “the very zeal of Jehovah” is bringing about all that he has promised, including the foretold international Kingdom witness.—Isa. 9:7; Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A NEW PEAK OF 723,220 PUBLISHERS IN AUGUST</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">With heartfelt gratitude, we join the psalmist in saying: “Praise Jah, you people! Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good.&quot; (Ps. 106:1) During August, thousands more Joined Jehovah's worshipers in unitedly saying, “Praise Jah”! The total of publishers was 27,533 more than reported last April. How glad we are, also, that a new peak of 37,220 regular pioneers was reached. This is 610 more than in May! Truly we see In this Jehovah's blessing upon his organized people. Having rested our hope on a living God, let us continue working hard and exerting ourselves in the ministry.— 1 Tim. 4:10.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> How do you feel when you hear someone comment for the first time at the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> Study or when he delivers his </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">first</span><span class="font13"> talk in the Theocratic’MIrnstry School? Are you not e</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ncouraged</span><span class="font13"> by seeing his advancement? What about your own spiritual advancement? Has it been evident to you and to others? Are you keeping pace with the growth of Jehovah’s organization today? We do not want to be- like those of whom Paul said: (‘‘You again need some</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">one to teach</span><span class="font13">~~vou from the beginning the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God.”](Heb. 5:12) How can we ‘make jout Advancement manifest to all persons’?—1 Tim. 4:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRESS IN TEACHING AND CONDUCT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Paul told Timothy, “P</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ay con</span><span class="font13">stant attention to yourself and to truths fresh in our mind. By studying the Bible, we absorb its spirit, which is Jehovah’s spirit. This will keep us aglow with zeal for preaching his message.—Rom. 12:11, 12; Eph. 5:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CLOSELY CONSIDER JESUS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah provided in his Son, Jesus Christ, the perfect example of a zealous minister. Jesus maintained his zeal right to the painful but triumphant end of his earthly life. Hebrews 12:2, 3 points out one thing that helped Jesus to remain firm. It was the reward that was set before him. Is not your zeal renewed when you consider the bright hope that Jehovah has set before you? Remember, it is not how long we have been zealous but our enduring to the end that will bring us the happy reward of eternal life.—Matt. 24:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> The doing of Jehovah’s work can in itself intensify our zeal. Consider Jesus’ example as related in John chapter 4. He got tired out. He needed rest, food, and drink. The disciples went into the village for food, but when they returned, their mas-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In the United States there are many congregations whose territory is comprised mainly or entirely of large and small apartment complexes. Some territories may include a wide variety of apartment buildings ranging from easily accessible housing projects to exclusive luxury apartments. Therefore, the points set out in this insert should be applied according to local circumstances. We feel confident that the information here presented will be helpful to all.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The challenge has been made. The command has been issued. Can you “bear </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">horoug</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font13"> witness to the good news”? (Acts 20:21, 24) It is imperative that you do so. Why? Because the time left for Kingdompreaching and disciple-making’ is reduce'dTTMatt. 24:14; 28:19, 20; 1 Cor. 7:29) This“challenge includes a type of territory that has a growing -potential—apartment, cooperative, and condominium buildings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> With land values continually increasing, more and more apartment buildings are being constructed, and territory in some large metropolitan areas is fast changing from single-family dwellings to multifamily units. Alm</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ost o</span><span class="font13">iw thirdx&gt;f Jhe housing available in the United States is o</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ccupied by r</span><span class="font13">enters.

<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Keep in mind that apartment dwellers are usually just average working people who are like us in various respects. In many cases, they are young co</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">uple</span><span class="font13">s starting off in marriage who cannot afford to buy their own home and so choose apartment living. Whatever the circumstances, apartment dwellers . have _the_ same spiritual and emotional needs that other people have. Publishers who have overcome their initial reluctance and have gained experience in working apartments have found productive territory. In fact, man</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">y capable m</span><span class="font13">inisters re</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ally enjoy working apartmen</span><span class="font13">t territory because of the positive results they get.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Why the Challenge?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> W</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">hy is it becom</span><span class="font13">ing_mo</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:line-through;">re of-a challeng</span><span class="font13">e to witness to apartment dwellers? Listen to the comment of on</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">e superintenden</span><span class="font13">t with seven years of experience: “Due to the increase in crime and violence, the big concern today with my tenants js </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">security.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Particularly, newer buildings not only are locked but have doormen and/or closed-circuit television monitors for surveillance. This is especially true of condominium apartments, where each unit is owned by the resident. Some condominium residents may feel that our presence in their building raises questions about the security of their building.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> To help us overcome any reluctance that we ourselves may have about apartment witnessing, we must remember that our motivations are noble. We do n</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ot seek to harm</span><span class="font13"> the people but, rather, to help them. Our visits jirttprompted by genuine and principle</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">d love</span><span class="font13"> for God and neighbor.

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">If You Are Asked to Leave</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> But what if we are asked </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">to leave</span><span class="font13"> a building by the superintendent or security personnel? It is usually b</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">est to comply immediately</span><span class="font13">. Whenever possible, we want to avoid confr</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ontati</span><span class="font13">on, with resulting threats of legal action and appeals to police./!/ the opportunity presents itself, we can tactfully and kindly_explain our presence to the inquirer./<sup>1</sup> Agree wi</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">th his dile</span><span class="font13">mma nf keeping his tenants happyand show that you </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">are sympa</span><span class="font13">thetic to his problem of maintaining proper security,” /uggests </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">one pioneer </span><span class="font13">who has had much experience in apartment witnessing. In this way, permission to remain in the building may be granted. But if not, take your leave graciously.—Col. 4:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Remember, do </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">not loo</span><span class="font13">k upoiL the_superinten-de</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nt, the doorma</span><span class="font13">n, or the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">security person as you</span><span class="font13">r e</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nemy.</span><span class="font13"> They have a j</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ob to do,</span><span class="font13"> and in most cases they are not </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">prej</span><span class="font13">udiced against Jehovah’s Witnesses. “Th</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">e doorman has inst</span><span class="font13">ructions from the owners no</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">t to let anyone</span><span class="font13"> in/’ explains a superintendent of a 62-unit apartment house.

<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> So we have to face the fact that there are some apartment b</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">uilding owners who have incorporated </span><span class="font13">st</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ipulations i</span><span class="font13">n their leases that allow_t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span><span class="font13">^</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">m</span><span class="font13"> to deter -</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">mine who shall or who shall not call</span><span class="font13"> on their tenants.

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Know Your Territory</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> As with all types of witnessing territory, it is a valuable aid to </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">be familia</span><span class="font13">r with the circumstances that exist in each building. Treat each apartment complex as a unique territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup> Do you know what type of people inhabit a certain apartment building? Does it cater to senior citizens? Singles or couples? Family groups? Are there large numbers of people of a c</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ertain ethnic </span><span class="font13">background? Do lo</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">w-income families live ther</span><span class="font13">e or is it a building with elaborate security systems that can be afforded only by t</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">he wealthy?</span><span class="font13"> Just as we must be flexible in our introductions from door to door, so we need to be adaptable when working various types of apartment dwellings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Gaining Entrance</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> There is no sub</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">stitute for a p</span><span class="font13">ers</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">onal, fac</span><span class="font13">e-to-fac</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">e discussi</span><span class="font13">on with an individual. This should be our first priority. Depending on the type of apartment building, one or two publishers may be able to g</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ain entry simply</span><span class="font13"> by waiting in the lobby until a re</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">sident leaves or</span><span class="font13"> enters. In such cases, they often will hold the door for you so you can enter the building. Of course, this situation does not usually occur in high-security buildings or condominiums, but it is often the way to gain admittance to some buildings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>14</sup> Frequently a publisher can use </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">the intercom </span><span class="font13">until he finds someone who will agree to the publisher coming in to see him personally. Again, depe</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nding on the kind of building it is an</span><span class="font13">d </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">the loc</span><span class="font13">al la</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ws, the publisher could then proceed tn mak</span><span class="font13">e o</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ther door-to-door call</span><span class="font13">s af</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ter having gained adm</span><span class="font13">ittance to the building. In some buildings it may be wise to leave the hallways after speaking to the one. who let you in and return to </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">the intercom to</span><span class="font13"> try the nextcall. This would take more time, but in certain buildings you may avoid problems if you proceed in this way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>15</sup> Carefully selectin</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">g appropriate time</span><span class="font13">s to work apartment buildings is important. In an increasing number of apartment houses, both husband and </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">wife work</span><span class="font13">, so few </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">people are found</span><span class="font13"> during weekdays. Some apartment dwellers sl</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">eep late on Satur</span><span class="font13">da</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">y and Sunday morning</span><span class="font13">s. Hence, early. evenings are a</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">n excellent tim</span><span class="font13">e to work such buildings, as are Saturday and Sunday afternoons. If publishers try to work these buildings during the mornings on weekends, they will often g</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">et people out of bed</span><span class="font13">, with resulting co</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">mplaints and confrontation</span><span class="font13">s.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>16</sup> Experience has shown that there is often better response in apartment buildings when a husband and </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">wife work toget</span><span class="font13">her or when a parent and child </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">or two sisters</span><span class="font13"> work together. Much may depend on the local situation. Consider this when arranging to work in buildings where it has been difficult to get people to respond.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>17</sup> When entering an apartment building, do not loiter at the entrance. Do not hesitate. Rather, proceed purposefully to the elevator and to the floor that is to be worked. This tends to dispel the suspicions of those who may see you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Appearance and Decorum Count</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>18</sup> Are you neatly groomed and dressed in a manner befitting a minister of the good news? This is particularly essential in apartment buildings in order to eliminate unnecessary anxieties or questions. When witnessing to apartment dwellers, a </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">pioneer </span><span class="font13">made these observations about dress: (‘Surprisingly, if you are w</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ell dresse</span><span class="font13">d, people will listen to you. They will stop and give you an extra measure of attention.” )</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>19</sup> Publishers having big, </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">bulky briefcases</span><span class="font13"> make themselves conspicuous^ Commenting about what tenants may think when they see strangers toting large briefcases, a superintendent said: '(They may have ro</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">bbery tools</span><span class="font13"> in their bags.”)Some publishers have found that it is better to have a less conspicuous case.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>20</sup> On bad-weather days, be sure to clean_your shoes before entering. Those who have fo^clean the floors will appreciate that and not feel they have good reason to deny us entry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>21</sup> Remember that sou</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nds w</span><span class="font13">ill echo in apartment buildings. So please b</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">e quiet</span><span class="font13">, using only the necessary </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">amount of volum</span><span class="font13">e in order to be comfortably heard by the householder. Two publishers working together should keep their voices low., since they may be overheard by householders. When speaking to one another, do so in a calm, moderate voice. This will avoid arousing suspicion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Calling at the Doors</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>22</sup> How do you k</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">nock on a door? </span><span class="font13">If a publisher knocks in an unnecessarily loud and authoritative manner, the d</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">weller might be frightened</span><span class="font13">. Depending on the type of building, some publishers have found it best not to do every door in succession down a corridor. Rather, a couple of calls can be done in one </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">end of the hallway, then publis</span><span class="font13">hers can move to </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:line-through;">the</span><span class="font13"> o</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:line-through;">the</span><span class="font13">r end, back and forth, until the floor is worked.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>23</sup> Before answering the door, many people will look through the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">peephol</span><span class="font13">e to see who is knocking. If you detect this, what can you do? One .sister experienced in apartment witnessing stated: (“Look directly at the peephole and immediately say._a w</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">arm gree</span><span class="font13">ting.”/ This lets the householder know that you know he is there. If the householder asks, “W</span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">ho is</span><span class="font13"> it?” you can simply give your name and that of </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">your com</span><span class="font13">panion. If this does not succeed in getting the householder to open the door, then identify yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>24</sup> “I like to </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">stand so</span><span class="font13"> that I am clearly visible to the householder peering through his peephole rather than standing off to the side, out of the householder’s sight line,” suggests another publisher. (“I smile as though I am on camera. If I am working with my wife, ! let her be in full view, as this often quiets the anxieties of the householder when an unexpected knock comes at his door.” )</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Avoid Confrontations</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>25</sup> If you meet an opposed householder who might be inclined to call the superintendent, it is best to leave that particular floor and return to it at another time. You may want to make note of the apartment number where the opposer lives and have this information put in the territory envelope so that in the future this can be worked last, just before leaving the building. In other cases, it would be best to leave the building entirely, in order to avoid a possible confrontation with the superintendent. If you can work along peacefully, without incident, you will have far better success.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>26</sup> A frequent complaint of superintendents (and some tenants) is that literature is left outside the apartment doors. “In almost every instance,” a brother writes, “where our brothers and sisters have requested permission to work in the building, it was granted as long as they didn’t leave literature around. The reason is simply that it means more work for the superintendent to pick up the literature that ends up on the floor.” Hence, if you leave tracts or handbills in doors of not-at-home apartments, care should be taken to insert the material </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">completely under</span><span class="font13"> the door—entirely out of sight.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>27</sup> In summary, many apartment buildings can be worked in the usual manner if we choose the right time and exercise discretion and tactfulness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">If Admittance Is Refused</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>28</sup> But suppose you are refused admittance to the building by the superintendent. What can be done? Ask for a mailing list of the tenants. Seek permission to leave literature at regular intervals in the lobby or laundry room or to post an announcement on their information board about our Bible study program, with information as to who can be contacted. In some apartment buildings, the use of closed-circuit television has been permitted for announcements of our congregation meetings and Bible study programs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>29</sup> The above suggestions do work. Note the observations of one circuit overseer: “About 80 to 85 percent of all security buildings that previously had barred our entrance granted some kind of concession when managers were contacted.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>30</sup> The following are additional suggestions on how to meet the challenge of witnessing in security buildings:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">□ USE OF INTERCOM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>31</sup> The intercom in the lobby can be used to make personal contact with individual apartment dwellers. Use a brief introduction that includes a request to speak personally with the resident. If he does not invite you to his apartment, ask if he could meet you in the lobby. Practice with other publishers beforehand not only what you will say but how and in what tone you will say it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">□ STREET WITNESSING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>32</sup> Street work in front of or in the immediate vicinity of the apartment building is effective if residents of the building use public transportation to go to and from work. Arrange to do your street witnessing during morning and afternoon hours when people generally go to work and return home. Of course, if the majority of people in the apartment building use their cars to go to work, street work outside the building may have limited, if any, effect.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">□ TELEPHONE WITNESSING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>33</sup> It may be possible to get names of residents from the directory in the lobby of an apartment building. Then the telephone directory can be consulted to determine their telephone numbers. Where this is not possible, there is usually a directory in the local library that lists the names of occupants of every home and apartment in the municipality. The names can be copied down and then telephone numbers determined from the telephone directory. Once names and telephone numbers are obtained, telephone territories may be organized under the direction of the service overseer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>34</sup> As in all forms of our witnessing activity, it is important to keep complete and accurate records. Before a telephone call is made, you already have the person’s name, address, and telephone number, so this can be recorded. Leave room for notations as to the householder’s interests and background, also</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">WITNESSING IN APARTMENT DWELLINGS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15">• Knock gently but firmly</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">• Keep voice at moderate level</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">• Make friendly introduction, giving name</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">• Get to spiritual point quickly</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">• Make literature offer, but do not insist</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">• Pave way for another d iscussion </span><span class="font13">the matters discussed during the first and subsequent calls.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>35</sup> Make calls only during reasonable hours. Do not let the phone ring incessantly. Just a few rings would appear to be sufficient, since in most apartments the person is not that far away from the telephone.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>36</sup> Since the person at the other end of the telephone cannot see us, we need to personalize our call as much as possible. How? First, introduce yourself by your first and last name, not simply by your first name. It adds more dignity to our message if we use our complete name. Second, use the householder’s name frequently during the conversation. Third, make sure you sound pleasant and cheerful, though always dignified. Fourth, speak slowly and articulate clearly, more so than you would normally. Fifth, be brief and mention the Bible early in the conversation, perhaps in the first few sentences. If they think you are a salesman, clear it up right away with something like, “We are not on any membership drive nor are we soliciting funds, but our motive is love for God and neighbor.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>37</sup> Since you cannot see the householder’s face to read a reaction, try to learn to detect voice reaction so as to know where to direct your discussion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>38</sup> When approaching the conclusion of the conversation, it is good to have in mind a question for the householder to think about or something to say which could lead to returning a call or a personal visit. Most people tend to shy away from committing themselves to having a stranger visit them, so a conclusion similar to this seems to work very well: “It has been so pleasant to speak with you. You have some interesting views of life, and your sincere interest in the Bible is commendable. We visit some of the neighbors in your building, and perhaps on occasion we can stop by to see if you are home and get to meet you personally.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>39</sup> Depending on their response, we may offer literature and ask when a convenient time would be to call by with it. Or we could wait until we meet them face to face.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>40</sup> When interest is located, it is better to meet the householder personally after the first or second phone call, rather than making repeated phone calls. This is done by using the buzzer at their apartment building and saying that we would like to introduce ourselves and say hello. The fewer words spoken on the intercom, the better.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>41</sup> Telephone witnessing can bring good results as this experience shows:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A man living in a controlled-access building responded to a pioneer's telephone call by saying: “This may sound funny, but I have just experienced some problems in my life and was wondering just before you phoned if there really is a God and if he cares at all about mankind.&quot; An appointment was made to visit him, and there were good prospects for a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Meet the Challenge Successfully</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>42</sup> Our commission is to “bear </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">thorough</span><span class="font13"> witness to the good news,” seeking to reach all sorts of persons with the Kingdom message. Good results are being obtained in many places, highlighting the fact that many righteously disposed persons live in apartment dwellings. By our not shying away from apartment witnessing or just skimming the surface, we are both bearing </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">thorough</span><span class="font13"> witness and helping ourselves be ‘free from the blood of all men.’—Acts 20: 24, 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>43</sup> Therefore, since apartment territory is increasing, will you face the challenge optimistically and make the necessary adjustments to meet the need? By doing so, you will not fail to discharge your God-given commission to preach the good news and make disciples of people in your territory, including apartment dwellers.</span></p></li></ul>

All of those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian's obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind when young brothers are nearing the age of 18 and give them appropriate reminders. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.</span></p>

Are there questions that you encounter in your ministry and that you find difficult to handle effectively? Would you appreciate some help with these in order to assist honest-hearted ones in your area to recognize the truth?” If your answer was yes to these questions posed by the speaker at the “Integrity Keepers” Convention, we are sure that you were thrilled at the announcement that the Society has produced a new handbook for the field ministry, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures.</span><span class="font13"> Since its release, have you been making full use of this fine instrument to ‘reason, explain, and prove’ from the Scriptures what you teach?—Acts 17:2, 3.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">( PRESENTING THE GOOD NEWS </span><span class="font11">\______________________________________________________________/</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>With a Positive Attitude</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> As bearers of the Kingdom good news, we need to develop and maintain a positive attitude toward our ministry. Why? Because this world, under Satan’s influence, is intent on making it difficult for us to do God’s will. That is why Paul encouraged Christians to have “the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had.” (Rom. 15:5) Although faced with much opposition, he always maintained a positive attitude. He spoke with confidence, basing his expressions on the authority of God’s Word. (Matt. 7: 28, 29) He did not hesitate to seize every opportunity to share the Kingdom hope with others. He spiritually strengthened those around him, encouraging them to follow his steps closely. Can we display the same positive attitude toward our preaching work today?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> At times we may develop negative feelings about our assigned territory because it appears to be unfruitful. To hold back from preaching would show an uncaring attitude. Even though Jesus knew that very few would respond favorably to the good news, he still “felt pity” for those to whom he preached. As he boldly persisted in preaching, he instructed his disciples to petition the Father to send out more “workers into his harvest.” (Matt. 9:36-38) Jesus’ outlook was always optimistic. He was determined to help those around him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> In more and more homes, both husband and wife work full time to maintain their preferred standard of living or simply to make ends meet. Often no one is at home when we call. A positive attitude may prompt us to consider making adjustments in our schedule to allow for better results. Have you considered scheduling some time for evening witnessing? Some have had excellent results by calling shortly after the evening meal when house</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12">November 17: Pages 26, (3) to 30, par. 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">November 24: Pages 31, par. 5 to 33, (4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Numbers in parentheses refer to questions within the text. holders are usually relaxed and in a more receptive frame of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BEING POSITIVE WITH OTHERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Much joy can be obtained by working with others in the ministry. This is especially true when our conversation reflects a positive attitude. Voicing negative feelings invariably causes discouragement. For example, in the time of ancient Israel, ten faithless spies gave “a bad report” that caused the hearts of the entire nation to melt in fearfulness. (Num. 13:32-14:3) In contrast, Solomon wrote: “A report that is good makes the bones fat.” (Prov. 15:30) Relating experiences that highlight good. things serves to strengthen others, motivating them toward continued zealous service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Are we at times prone to minimize the extent of a person’s interest, even when we have had a good Scriptural conversation? Some may feel pessimistic about going back, thinking that the interest was not sufficient or genuine. Never forget that “the word of God is alive and exerts power.” (Heb. 4:12) Our brothers have related countless experiences in which sincere individuals have been profoundly impressed by some simple statement or by reading only one article in a magazine. With that possibility in view, we should be determined to follow up properly any interest we find.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Jesus maintained a positive attitude because he was totally convinced that he had the truth that could set men free. (John 8:32) He fully accomplished his ministry despite all obstacles, including the disbelief of others, apathy, and even persecution. The marvelous results he achieved, along with his assurance to be with us always, should give us the determination we need to press forward with a positive attitude, knowing that with Jehovah’s help we, too, can fully accomplish our ministry. —Matt. 28:20; 2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul wrote words containing wise and beneficial counsel for the blessing of God’s people in the first century. These are part of the inspired Word of God, and they greatly benefit the Christian congregation today. Paul knew that what he wrote had the direction of God’s holy spirit and would be helpful to those reading and applying the counsel. To Timothy, he said: “Keep holding the pattern of healthful words that you heard from me with the faith and love that are in connection with Christ Jesus.”—2 Tim. 1:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> How was Timothy able to do that? For one thing he was advised by Paul: “You, however, continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe, knowing from what persons you learned them.” (2 Tim. 3:14) Paul and others nurtured young Timothy in the way of the truth. He grew up to become a fine minister of the good news, a close companion of Paul, one that could be relied upon to assist others also to “keep holding the pattern of healthful words.” Do you think Timothy would have been the outstanding Christian man he proved to be if he had not listened, learned, and</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Spring—A Season for Extra Effort</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Most of us look forward to spring. Springtime is a season of refreshing changes. The coldness of winter surrenders to the warm air of spring. We delight to see renewed life and longer days. Yet a greater reason to look forward to spring is that it opens the way for many of us to put forth a greater effort in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> In the past, the months of March, April, and May have been especially good months for many publishers to serve as auxiliary pioneers. This year, those that have full-time secular jobs may find that March, which has five weekends, will be particularly suitable for them to devote 60 hours or more in the ministry. Can you do so? If so, blessings await you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> One brother with a full-time job determined that he could auxiliary pioneer by starting to witness in the business section of the territory early in the morning. This brother enjoyed many fine experiences including the starting of a new Bible study that he conducted during the morning before starting his secular work. Another brother who has to work full time decided he would auxiliary pioneer. Having this added motivation, he mustered up courage to do then practiced such things that make up the Christian personality? Hardly! So what does that tell us today about our responsibility to teach healthful words to others?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> We should make every effort to sound down the truth into the hearts of Bible students. If we accomplish that, their motivation for doing Jehovah’s will can be based on the right desire, to please Jehovah and to make known to others the wonderful promises of his Word. To sound down the truth into the hearts of others demands that we ourselves be firmly grounded in the truth. Are we? The fine example we set by our conduct is an evidence of our firm foundation. (1 Tim. 4:12) If our language is pure and our attitude toward our brothers is exemplary, we reflect the new personality and give further evidence that the truth is in our hearts. (Eph. 4:29, 31, 32) Having put on such new personality, we are able to recommend the Christian way of life to others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">you have started a Bible study do you direct the interested ones to the organization on a regular basis? There are a number of ways to do this. You can inform them of the meetings at the Kingdom Hall and explain their purpose. Progressively you can outline the reasons for such meetings—the Public Meeting one week, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> Study another, and so on—whetting their appetite for further Bible knowledge. As time passes you can emphasize that we do not want to be content with just learning the good news ourselves, but we want to share it with others. Encourage Bible students to talk to their neighbors, relatives, friends, and others. Prepare them for the day when they too will engage in the house-to-house ministry. Show that coming to know the truth is only the beginning. Others need to hear this good news of the Kingdom too.—Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> From now on, it would be appropriate to invite Bible students and interested ones to the Memorial cel</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15 min: </span><span class="font11">“Spring—A Season for Extra Effort.” Question-and-answer coverage. Relate last year’s figures on ebration. Just think, last year the Memorial attendance in this country alone came to 1,611,310! That gives evidence that many are responding to the invitation to come and drink the water of life.—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> Of course, what is said about helping Bible students applies with equal force to helping our children. We want to build up in them a heartfelt appreciation for Jehovah, his Word, and his organization so that they too will “keep holding the pattern of healthful words.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ Although February is a short month, and may bring inclement weather in some places, good work can be done even as in past years.

<p><span class="font11">pioneer, you can demonstrate your faith by doing just as much as you can, and you can likewise expect Jehovah’s approval and blessing. —Heb. 11:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>G</sup> Publishers in need of suggestions on how they can work things out in a practical way so as to auxiliary pioneer might talk to the service overseer or another elder. Elders can take the initiative to speak to certain ones they know qualify and who would enjoy this added privilege of service. A few kind words of encouragement or practical suggestions may be just what is needed. (Prov. 25:11) Also, in view of longer days and the increased field activity, it would be well for the elders to make arrangements for evening witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Let us pray for Jehovah’s blessing on our united efforts this spring so that many more thousands of people will come to enjoy “seasons of refreshing” through gaining a good relationship with our Heavenly Father.—Acts 3:19.</span></p>

Make mention that his name is put on high.” (Isa. 12:4) This is what all of us want to do, and it is one of the reasons why the brochure </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever</span><span class="font11"> was published. Since its release at the conventions last summer, this brochure has helped us fulfill this command even more effectively. Doubtless, most of us have read the brochure by now.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDUCTING STUDIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> The use of </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">leading quest</span><span class="font11">ions is an ' excellent way to develop the thinking ability of our students. Christ Jesus did this on many occasions. (Matt_22i41*46) Leading questions help students arrive at proper conclusions, using Scriptural truths they have acquired. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">i/uvj'f</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> There is an extra step for the study conductor. When he finds the main point in the paragraph, he will formulate a question to highlight that point. For example, in the first paragraph on page 3, the Lord’s Prayer is discussed, particularly the first words of it. Hence, the conductor may wish to ask: “What prayer is familiar to most religious persons? How does that prayer begin?” The second paragraph shows what is implied by the order of subjects in the Lord’s Prayer. So the conductor could ask: “What is the most important thing that we can pray for? This is more important than what other things?” Questions should be short, clear, and to the point.

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">By Offering Subscriptions on Return Visits</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> While it is true that many subscriptions are obtained as we offer them in our house-to-house ministry, many publishers have been very successful in obtaining subscriptions on return visits. These calls may be on people who promised to subscribe, those who indicate they might subscribe, persons for whom we have expiring-subscription slips, individuals we have on our magazine route, or people we have studied with in the past. How can we follow through on such calls?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> If someone indicates he wants to subscribe but does not have the funds at the time, we can fill out the subscription slip and have him tell us when he wants us to call back to pick up the contribution for the subscription. Of course, we would not turn in the subscription until the person contributes for it. But many have found that by filling out the slip on the first call and then returning at the time the householder suggests, they are able to obtain subscriptions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> If someone wants to read a single copy before deciding whether to subscribe, we can place the current issues and arrange to call back. When we return, we can remind the householder of what we talked about before and share some additional thoughts with him. Then we can mention that he said he might subscribe after having had the opportunity to read the current issue. Subscriptions have often been obtained on such calls.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">' The Society sends notification to the congregation when subscriptions are nearing expiration. The brother who handles subscriptions in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Brochure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ly questions should be asked one at a time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> The large boxes contain important information that should be discussed right after the paragraph to which they most closely relate. For example, the box on page 7 may be discussed after paragraph 2 on page 11. The large box on page 21 may be discussed when the assigned portion for that week has been covered. And the box on page 25 may be discussed after paragraph 4 on page 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> In some cases the study conductor may prefer to have all the paragraphs in the box read at one time congregation checks to see who obtained the expiring subscriptions and gives the slips to those individuals. If the publisher has moved away, you might be asked to call on a person from whom someone else obtained the subscription. When making such calls, we can highlight some beneficial point that was covered recently in the magazine and then encourage the subscriber to renew right away so he does not miss any issues.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> There may be persons on our magazine route who are not always at home when we call. Or it may be that we have much territory to cover and we are not able to get to these individuals every time we have new issues of the magazines. We can tell them that by having the subscriptions they would never miss an issue of the magazines, and in this way we might be able to obtain subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>G</sup> Then there are those who used to study but who stopped for one reason or another. The Society has suggested that we get in touch with such individuals occasionally to see if their interest can be aroused again. We could call and give them the opportunity to subscribe if they are not already doing so. Perhaps something they read in one of the magazines will rekindle their interest in again studying the Bible with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’We have the best magazines<sub>z</sub>in the world, and we certainly want to do all we can to help others to benefit from them too. When a person subscribes, everyone in that household will have the opportunity to read the Bible-based information in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> and may be helped on the road to eternal life.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font11">and then discuss the box as a whole, rather than paragraph by paragraph. (There is no need to read the contents of the box on page 8.) Those in attendance can comment on the smaller boxes and illustrations. If they fail to do so, the conductor should draw attention to the information when appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">’ Our studying the brochure </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever</span><span class="font11"> will help us to think upon Jehovah’s name. (Mal. 3:16) If we prepare conscientiously and are present at each study, we will be qualified to help others also to think upon Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Helping to Meet Some Critical Kingdom Hall Needs</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> The formation of 159 new congregations during the past service year and the continued growth in meeting attendance have resulted in a need for hundreds of new and expanded Kingdom Halls. Although the increased price of property and the ever-increasing cost of building materials have made it impossible for many congregations to build a new hall on their own, our unified efforts in combining contributions from all congregations into the Society’s Kingdom Hall Fund have made it possible for all to share in meeting some of the most critical needs. For example, three congregations were meeting in a building that was to be torn down to make way for a new highway interchange. Another congregation was meeting in the basement room of a brother who had to move.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> The purpose of the fund is to help congregations that have a pressing need for a Kingdom Hall. If congregations wish to remodel an existing hall just for appearance’ sake or to replace an adequate Kingdom Hall with a more modern one, they should plan on financing their own project without assistance from the Society’s fund. The decision to do that would be made locally by the bodies of elders and the congregations. It is not appropriate for congregations to solicit contributions for Kingdom Halls from other congregations or ask them to provide food for workers on such a project. Of course, some nearby congregations may wish to be of help and volunteer such assistance, but this would be for them to decide.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> On a local level, congregations contemplating building or remodeling in the future may have a local Building Fund contribution box, in addition to the box for the Society’s Kingdom Hall Fund. This will allow publishers to be of assistance in meeting their own local needs in addition to having a share in helping others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Much still remains to be done. Congregations that have their Kingdom Halls paid for are generously contributing each month, thus helping others enjoy the blessing of having adequate Kingdom Halls, so that more individuals can gather with us, all to Jehovah’s praise. —Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup><a name="bookmark5"></a></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup></sup> April has proved to be a special month for the auxiliary pioneer service. April 1983 saw 84,285 of us in the auxiliary pioneer work. That was an increase of 8,747 over April 1982. Could we reach that peak again? In April 1984 this peak was surpassed by 9,705 with a total of 93,990 auxiliary pioneers. This means that last April, on the average, each congregation in the United States had over 11 auxiliary pioneers. Also, almost 5.5 million hours in the ministry came from this group alone! What will happen this April?</span></p>

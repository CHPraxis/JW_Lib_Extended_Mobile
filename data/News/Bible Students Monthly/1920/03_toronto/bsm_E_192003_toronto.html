<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark3"></a>CALAMITIES—WHY PERMITTED</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">“There were present at that season some who told him of the Galileans, whose blood. Pilate had mingled with theij sacrifices. And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things? I tell you, Nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘■‘Or, those eighteen, upon whom the tower of Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jesusalem? I tell you, Nay; but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.’’—Luke 13: 1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’Noble and good in the sight of both God and man ere the generous impulses of charity and, sympathy, awakened by grcat calamities in recent years. And when this is said, it leaves little more to be said favorable to calamities or their influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">_ While these charities should not be misconstrued to signify that God’s consecrated saints are rapidly multiplying—for many of the charitable are not the consecrated, and some are even infidels—yet they are an. evidence that at least some of the original God-likness of our race remains; that it has not been wholly obliterated by the degradation of the fall, nor wholly poisoned by the bad theology of the dark ages. While we live in a period, perhaps, as selfish and money-loving as any known to history, yet millions of dollars are generously poured forth to ..aid .sufferjng_hujngn.it.y._<sub>;</sub> .And yejfl.m.any' who in times “of calamitous distress show that they have a tender spot somewhere in their hearts, would and do at other times lend time and brain and skill to the arts of war, and in designing the most horrible implements of warfare; and on occasions when bitter pas-&lt;ions are aroused would relentlessly and pitilessly laughter a thousand times as many as meet death by the accidents of nature. Yet, for all this showing of the two elements in the same men, we rejoice that the God-like element of sympathy exists, as a partial offset to the devilish qualities of selfishness and heartlessness, which, under the degrading influence of man’s fallen state, have grown strong during the past six thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Preparatory to looking carefully, reasonably and Scripturally at the question, Why does Gpd permit calamities? let us note some of the absurd views of some Christion people, who should know God’s Word, and character much better than they seem to know' them. Some, whose hearts in the presence of great calamities Overflow with sympathy and God-like love (which proves their hearts better and more sound than their theology), declare that God is the director and cause of all disasters and troubles. Hence, whatever men may do to alleviate such distresses would, according to this false view, be so much done in opposition to God; and whatever love and sympathy they feel, is so much sentiment opposed to God’s sentiments—&lt; which are thus made to appear malicious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But it seems a very slight thing to charge the Almighty with causing earth’s calamities—in comparison with the general thought of Christendom, that God had premeditated, planned, from before the foundation of the world, their everlasting torture—the direst calamity imaginable. Tornadoes, earthquakes, epidemics of disease, would be mercies and kindnesses in comparison with such diabolical schemes and preparations as are accredited to the Lord by the vast majority of his children, who suffer still from the superstition, ignorance and blindness of the “dark ages,’’ and its creeds. Alas, that such false conceptions of the justice and love Of our Creator should ever have gained a foothold in our minds—to distort our every conception of every right and good quality. O Lord, grant Thy people a great opening of the eyes of their understanding, that we may be able to comprehend with all saints, the lengths and the breadths, the heights and the depths'of Thy love and mercy toward Thy creatures through Jesus Christ, our Lord!<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark4">1</a></sup> The difficulty is that men have been led to consider the very Bible which declares God’s true character of love and justice as authority for these devilish doctrines; and these false interpretations were originated in the “dark ages’’ by those who instigated or assisted in burning, and otherwise tormenting, real Bible believers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s Sympathy—How Shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we declare that whatever there is of love and sympathy in man is only the remnant of the original divine lilteness in which Adam was created, not wholly effaced by six thousand years of degradation in sin, it</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">at once arouses the question: Tn what way does God manifest his sympathy and love in such emergencies, when even the hearts of fallen human beings are touched, with sympathy and. love—to acts of kindness and succor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A correct answer is, that God is represented in every act of kindness done, whether by his children or by the world; because their actions under such circumstances are the'result of their possession of some measure of his character and disposition. This answer is not full enough to be satisfactory; but, thank God, a fuller investigation, in the light of his Word, reveals a boundless sympathy on his part—providing an'abund</span><span class="font5">ant succor, which is </span><span class="font4">shortly to be revealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But why does not God immediately succor his creatures from calamities? Or, to go still further back, why does he, who has all wisdom to know and all power to prevent, permit calamities—cyclones, earthquakes, tidal waves, destructive floods, pestilences, etc.? And while we are about it, we may as well include all the evils which God could prevent, if he would—all the forms of sickness and pain and death; every manner of destruction—-wars, murders, etc.; everything which causes pain or trouble to those filling to do and to be in harmony with God? The answer to one of these questions will be the answer to every question on the subject; for all<sup>:</sup> human evils are related and have a common source or cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">— .■•To comprehend' this cause-felly,■ must. go far<sup>1</sup> back,■ to the very beginning of sickness, pain, death and sorrow—to the Garden of Eden, where neither famine, pestilence, cyclone, earthquake, nor death in. any form was permitted; where man and his surroundings and conditions were pronounced “very good,” even by God himself, and&quot; mdt certainly have been greatly appreciated by man, who had to be driven out and prevented from returning by the fiery sword which kept the Way of access to the life-sustaining fruits of the Garden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And this Creator, who so graciously provided for tho life and comfort of his creatures, and who communed with them and gave them his blessing and the promise of everlasting life upon the sole condition of continued obedience-—how came it that he should so change in his attitude toward his creatures as to drive them from the enjoyments of those Eden comforts and blessings, out into the unprepared earth—-to toil and weariness and insufficient sustenance, and thus to death?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We must remember that the Creator specially or miraculously “prepared” in advance the Garden of Eden, only, for man’s comfortable enjoyment of the favors of life, and a fitting place for his trial. God foresaw the fall of his creature, and provided that, the penalty of sin, “flying thou shalt die,” instead of being suddenly inflicted, as by a lightning stroke or other speedy method, should be served out gradually by conflict witji the unfavorable conditions (of climate, sterility of soil, storms, miasma, thorns, weeds, etc.), of the unprepared earth; the preparation of which would require seven thousand years more to entirely fit it for the habitation of perfect, obedient, human children of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mau a Convict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Adam and Eve, therefore, went forth from Eden convicts, under sentence of death self-convicted under the most just of all judges, their Creator and friend. The convicts esteemed it a mercy to be let die gradually rather than suddenly; while to the Creator and Judge this was expedient because of His plan for their future, yn which such experience with imperfect conditions would be of great value—-a plan for the increase of the race, and for its discipline and final redemption and restoration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The doath penalty, inflicted in this manner, God foresaw would, through experience, furnish man such a lesson on the exceeding sinfulness of sin and its baneful results as would never need to be repeated—r-a lesson, therefore, which would profit all who learn it to all eternity; especially when Christ’s Millennial reign of righteousness shall manifest in contrast the fruits of righteousness. God also designed that the exercise of man’s mental faculties in coping with the disturbances and-imperfettions of his surroundings and in inventing reliefs, and the exercise of his moral faculties in combating his own weaknesses, and the calls upon his sympathy, should prove kesneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Had the sentence of God (in addition to a loss of Eden’s comforts and experience with sin and death) condemned his creatures to an eternity of torment and anguish, as so many now believe and teach, who could defend such a sentence, or call ths Judge just, or loving, or in any sense good? Surely no one of a sound mind!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">But when it is seen that the Scriptures teach that . death (extinction), and not life in torment, was the penalty pronounced and inflicted, all is reasonable. God has a right to demand perfect obedience from his perfect creature when placed under perfect conditions, as in Adam’s case. And the decree that none shall live everlastingly except the perfect, is both a wise and a just provision for the everlasting welfare of all God’s creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a depth of meaning in the Creator’s words, as he sent forth his fairly tried and. justly condemned creatures, among the thorns and briars, to labor and pain,' and sorrow, and disease and to .be subject to the ' casualties and calamities of nature’s unfinished jwork. He said, “Cursed is the ground for thy sake”; i.e., The earth, in general is in its present imperfect condition for your profit and experience; even though you may not esteem it so. Adam would have sought to retain continual access to the garden fruits, to avoid severe labor and to enable him to fully sustain his vital powers and live forever; but in loving consideration for man’s ultimate good, no less than in justice, and in respect for his own sentence of death, God prevented this and guarded the way back to the Garden; in order that the death sentence should not fail of execution, in order that sinners should not live forever and thus perpetuate sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The children of the condemned pair inherited their fell, imperfections and ■.■•'weaknesses; and also the penalties of these; for “who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?” The whole race, therefore, as convict laborers, have not only been learning what sin and evil are, and their undesirable results, but by their labor and skill they are serving to prepare the earth- and bring it as a whole to the full perfection designed for it, and illustrated in the condition of Eden—ready for a further purpose of God of which none but his children (and not all of them) are made aware through the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We can see, then, that labor and toil were prescribed for man’s good. They have kept him so employed that he could not plan and consummate evil to the same extent that he otherwise. would have done. And as the earth becomes more fertile, approaching perfection, man’s vitality becomes less; so that now, with greater leisure to plot and scheme and grow wise in evil, the period of life in which to do so is shorter. What a mercy in disguise is present shortness of-life, under present circumstances! Were some of our “shrewd business men” who accumulate millions of money, and grasp great power in a few short years, to live 930 years, as Adam did, what might we expect but that one man, or at most a syndicate or trust, would own every foot of land, control every drop of water and every breath of air, and have the rest of the race for their dupes and slaves?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s action, then, in« exposing his creatures to death, pain and various calamities, it must be seen, was, first of all, one which related only to his present life </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font4">earth, and to no other; for of any continuance of life, in any other locality, God did not give him the Slightest intimation. On the contrary, the words of the penalty were: “Dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return”—“dying thou shalt die.”—Gen. 3:19; 2: 17, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">True, God gave promise that, somehow and at some time, a son of the woman should accomplish a deliverance. But it was then vague and indefinite, merely </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">glimmer of hope, to show them that though God dealt severely with them, and on lines of law and justice, yet he sympathized with them, and would, ultimately, without violating justice or ignoring his own righteous sentence of death, bring succor.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>God Just, Yet the Justifier of Sinners.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Paul tells us that God adopted a method for the recovery of man from that original sentence of death that came upon all as the result of Adam’s fall, which would show the justice of his sentence and the unchangeableness of his decrees, and yet permit such as are sick of sin to use their experience wisely, and to return to harmony and obedience to their Creator and his just and reasonable laws and regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This Divine Plan, by which God could remain just and unchangeable in his attitude toward sin and sinners, and yet release the well-disposed from the penalty of sin (death and disfavor), is stated by the Apostle in Rom. 3: 24-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In brief, this plan provided that another man who, by obedience to the law of God, should prove his worthiness of eternal life, might, by the willing sacrifice of the</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">। &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Redeemer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the condemnation to death was thus upon all men, and since another man newly created and inexperienced as Adam was, though just as favorably situated, would have been similarly liable to fall, God devised the marvelous plan of transferring his own begotten Son from the spiritual to the human nature and thus provided a man fit for sacrifice—“the man Christ Jesus who gave himself </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a ransom </span><span class="font4">for all”; “who, though he was rich [though he was possessed of glory and honor and riches and wisdom and powsr above both angels and men], nevertheless for our sakes became poor (humbling himself to a lower nature, that of a man, becoming obedient even unto death) that we through his poverty might be made rich.”-—1 Tim. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2: 5, 6; 2 Cor. 8: 9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">As our Lord Jesus used the calamities of his time as' illustrating the just penalty against all who. do not flee sin and lay hold upon the Redeemer and Life-giver^ so-we use them.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Ah, yes! The subject would be incomplete were this point left untouched. The consecrated saints^ the we believe the resurrection to be a very important doctrine in its connection with other doctrines of Scripture (throwing light upon other doctrines), that we desire to call general attention to this subject and to invite an examination of our question in the light ■ of facts and of- Scripture; Our hope being that after a careful examination of the subject many more of God’s people will come to believe—consistently, logically, Scripturally-—in a resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Resurrection Barely Chosen Now as a Subject for Sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Like priest, like people,” is an old adage, which implies that the views of the teaching or clerical class on any subject may safely be considered an index </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">the views of their parishioners. It is not ^difficult </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">ascertain the views of the clergy of all denominations on the subject of the resurrection of the dead; for, although that topic is rarely chosen for disemtrse; except upon Easter Sunday, it is, nevertheless, indissolubly attached to every funeral service; and these .</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">numerous occasions, we believe, amply.Justify us in the statement that, both the clergy of all denominations and</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">True, it is customary on every funeral occasion to read the words of the Apostle Paul, in which he seta forth the resurrection as the Christian’s hope (1 Cor. 15), but this seems to be a mere concession on the part of the officiating minister. He feels it to be his duty to read something on the subject, but his remarks following the reading prove most conclusively that, so far from believing that the person whose corpse is about to be buried is dead, he believes, and instructs his hearers that they should believe that their friend and neighbor is “more alive than he ever was.” Frequently, indeed, he plays directly into the hands of the ‘ ‘Spiritualists” and “Christian Scientists,” by telling the audi-•ence that the spirit of their dead friend is with them in the room, hovering over them; and that if permitted to speak he would say to them, “Dry your tears; weep not for me; I am far better off in glory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To Many Death has Become a Delusion and Not a Reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Indeed, it has come to be the general belief am'ong Christian people that death is a delusion, and not a reality; that people merely seem to die, and do not die; that they merely experience a change to a higher form of being;, that, so-called<sup>4</sup> “Christian Scientists” are quite correct in saying, “There is no death.” '</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whoever holds such views does not, cannot consistently believe in “the resurrection of the dead”; because if on one is dead, how can there be a resurrection of the dead? Wherein would be the sense in speaking of a resurection of the dead to life, if they already have life more abundantly than, they possessed it before they seemingly died?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But thousands of ministers would answer us, saying, “When speaking of the resurrection, we merely mean a resurrection: of the body—the bodies which we bury are all to come forth again from the grave, and the spirits which parted from them in death are to be rehabilitated in those bodies in the resurrection. This is what we baean by resurrection.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">.Well, well! Who would have supposed such inconsistency on the part of so many learned and well-meaning men I Before taking up the Scriptural side of the question, to show that such expectations are at variance with the Scripture teaching, let us examine the proposition of these ministers in the light of its own inconsistency.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">(1) They tell us that the deceased is “far better off,” in that he he<sup>:</sup> has gotten free from the “fetters of the flesh,” and that now “his free spirit wings its flight to God, no longer hampered and hindered by the mortal dust.” They go into ecstasies in describing the grandeur and liberty and blessedness of the one who has died, and who, by reason of getting rid of the body, has attained to life more abundant, knowledge a hundred-fold, and blessings indescribable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">(2) In the same breath they quote the Scriptures from various parts-of the earth, where a finger, a foot, or a hand had been lost by accident, disease or amputation) ; they tell us that then the spirit beings which, they say, left those bodies at death, will return to them, as their everlasting habitations. Then, inasmuch as the resurrection is Scripturally set forth to be the grand and glorious result and consummation of our salvation, they feel compelled to go into ecstasies over their erroneous presentation of the resurrection, and to tell how glorious and grand will be the result.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The Man 50 Would be Sadly Handicapped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They seem </span><span class="font5">to </span><span class="font4">overlook entirely </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font4">inconsistency </span><span class="font5">of </span><span class="font4">these two propositions; and they expect that their hearers will be similarly inconsistent and illogical (and apparently their expectations are fully justified, for the majority of their hearers swallow the inconsistency Without difficulty..; yea, many of them seem to think that the more \inconsistent and unreasonable their belief may be, the more reason they have to congratulate themselves that they have a very strong faith. However, the real fact is that they have a very strong credulity. But they will have no reward for believing unreasonable things which God’s Word has not taught, but has contradicted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Who cannot see, if he will, that the man who dies fifty years old, if in - dying he obtains life more abundant and knowledge a hundredfold, and a freedom to “wing his flight,” etc., would be sadly disappointed by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> resurrection—if it should, mean to him reimprisonment in a tenement, of clay, with physical restrictions and human limitations? And then, if he had thus for Centuries been a “free spirit,” roaming at liberty throughout the Universe, untrammeled by a body and bodily limitations, where would be the consistency on God’s part of reimprisoning such an one in a human body, whose powers and uses would be entirely forgotten during those centuries of liberty? And if to be Without a body is “perfect bliss,” aS the funeral orators tell, how could there be anything added to perfect bliss by a resurrection Of the body, and a reincarceration therein?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the foregoing considerations we feel that we i are justified in our assumption that the-vast majority Of Christian people do not believe in a resurrection—-neither the Scriptural kind (“a resurrection of the Sead”), nor in the kind they themselves teach, namely, a resurrection of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures Hold Out the Only Hope, the Consistent Hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With this preface to our subject we go to the Scrip- &gt;&nbsp;tures to learn from them what is meant by ‘ ‘the resurrection of the dead,” and in what manner and why the Scriptures speak of the resurrection as the hope, the oily hope, the blessed hope, not only of the Lord’s people, who are to have part in- the “first resurrection,” but ’of the world in general, whd are to have an opportunity to share in the resurrection. of judgment, improperly translated, “the resurrection of damnation.”—John 5; 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whoever would believe the Scriptural doctrine of the resurrection must also believe the Scriptural doctrine respecting death—that death is death, the cessation of life. Then, and not until then, will he be able to understand the Apostle’s words in our text, “If there</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Nor is this statement by the great Apostle Paul an exception to or indifferent from the teaching of the Scriptures elsewhere. Their unanimous testimony </span><span class="font5">is </span><span class="font4">that the dead are dead; that “in that very day their</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">accordirig to the Divine penalty for sin pronounced against our race—“Dying thou shalt die.” The opposers take up with Satan’s delusive statement to Mother Eve, “Ye shall not surely die,” and attempt to prove that the dead are not dead; that God’s penalty against sin did not go into effect, and that death, so far from being the sentence or curse upon our race, is a blessing, a step in a general process of evolution. The two theories are as far apart as the poles, and the two teachers of these two theories, as we have shown, are God, on the one hand, and Satan, “a liar from the beginning,” on the other hand. Which shall we believe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The entire Plan of Salvation is connected with this question. If death was not the penalty of sin, incurred through Adam, then “life and that more abundant” is not the reward and blessing of God secured through Christ by a resurrection.

<p><span class="font4">is only a further step to deny that he ever had a trial fruit of its trees. Thus driven out, the sentence, Die-and that he ever failed and fell from grace. And if the mg, thou shalt die, took effect uppn Father Adana fall is denied, and, instead, the claim is put forward gradually, and he lived out nearly to the end of the first that man has really been advancing even to the present thousand-year day;.

<p><span class="font5">No </span><span class="font4">wonder that, blinded by this deception of difficult to deny the reality of sin. If it is claimed that Father Adam was not created in the image and likeness of God, but was created a very close image and likeness </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the monkey, it follows that in that low condition of time—losing his likeness to the monkey and gaining in likeness to God, then it will be consistent also to take the next step, and declare that since man did not fall he did not need to be redeemed from the fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And hence, with all such reasoning upon false Scriptural basis, it appears logical to deny the oft-repeated declaration of God’s Word, that our Lord Jesus is our Redeemer, and that “He is the propitiation for our sins [the Church’s sins], and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world,” giving for us, as our ransom or corresponding price, His own life, that He might buy back the forfeited life of Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We thus see that the leading lights of Christendom today, repudiate both of the cardinal features of the Gospel, which the Apostle preached of old: “He preached Jesus and the resurrection”—Jesus as the Redeemer of mankind from sin and its curse—death—and the resurrection as the grand result of that redemptive work, by which the blessing secured by the Ransomsacrifice will be made applicable to and available for whosoever wills to accept eternal life upon the terms ' of this Age.

<p><span class="font4">The Scripture declarations respecting death are in full accord with the testimony of the five senses given us as men by bur Creator; and this is what we should expect, though we should be ready to admit the possibility of our senses being in error if the Divine revelation contradicts our senses. But when our senses are contradicted by a human theory, contrary to Scriptural statements, the theory should be rejected and the testimony of the senses held to be true; and when the Scripturs and our senses together unite ih one testimony, it is certainly wrong to hold to a theory of human dissolution, which is contradicted by Divine revelation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But with a longing for a future life, implanted iff your nature by our Creator, you inquire, Is there no hope; hath a man no pre-eminence above a a beast? The Scriptures answer your question, assuring us that, physically speaking, &gt;&nbsp;man “hath no pre-eminence above a beast.” But the Scriptures assure us that although mankind is not possessed of any power of life beyond that of the beast, the Creator has, nevertheless, made </span><span class="font5">a </span><span class="font4">provision for man that He did not make for the beast; and that provision is the very thing for which we long, labor and sorrow” and they are- soon “cut off from the land of the living,” to go into “the land of ths enemy”—into the great prison-house of death, in which it is estimated that over twenty thousand millions of our races are already—“where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.”—Job 3: 17-19.</span></p>

The Scriptures answer: He laid down His life for us; “He died for our sins”; “He died, the Just for the u,njust” ; “He poured our His soul unto death” ; - He ’ ‘made His soul an offering for [our] sin,” and “by His strines we are healed.”—Rom. 5: 8.; 1 Pet. 3: 18; Isa. 53: 4, 6, 10'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. Nothing is more evident than that our Lord Jesus did' not suffer an eternity of torment as the price of our redemption; and hence, if the matter needed proof we have here the proof that eternal torment was not the penalty for our sins. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">But if Jesus’ death ransoms man from the sentence of death, so His resurrection- from death became the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">assurance of the justification of all who accept and obey Him. The Heavenly Father gave evidence that, the-: Ransom price was entirely satisfactory; and our Lord, who was thus obedient to the Father, was raised from the dead and, as the Father’s Agent and ’ Representative, Will soon 'begin the work of blessing the entire world redeemed by His precious blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Prison-House of Death to be Opened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The blessing of the world iheans the breaking open . of the prison-house and the setting at liberty of the captives, who for six thousand years have been going into the prison-house of death. 'For this reason our Lord is called the Life-giver, because His great work .will be to give back life to the world of mankind, who lost , life in Adam. And .since the restoration of life to mankind will mean the removal of pains and sicknesses and troubles, which are a part of the dying process, our Redeemer is styled the Great Physician.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophecy which mentions the breaking open of the prison-house of death, and the setting at liberty of its captives (Isa. 42: 7), was applied, and unquestionably correctly, by our Lord to Himself; but He did not break open the prison-house of death, and set all the captives free by resurrection immediately upon His own resurrection. He tells us when this work will be done, saying (John 5: 25-29), “The hour cometh in ’which all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of Man, and come forth’’; “and they that hear [obey His voice then, Acts 3 : 22] shall live.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Lord thus passed over the interim of the Gospel Age, and pointed to the grand consummation of His work in the incoming Age because such was the Father’s prearranged Plan. “The Father sent the Son,” and the Son willingly undertook the work of redemption, at a time sufficiently in advance of the “Times of Restitution,” or resurrection, and the general blessing of the world during the Reign of Messiah, to leave the interim of this Gospel Age for another work, namely, for selecting from the world a “little flock,” a “royal priesthood,” a “peculiar people,” a “hqly nation,” to be j dint-heirs with Christ Jesus their Lord in the honors, of the Mediatorial Kingdom. These shall be associated with the Redeemer in the grand and glorious work of destroying the Prince of Darkness and break-. ing open the prison-house of death, and setting at liberty the captives of sin and ignorance and superstition; and in fulfilling generally all the provisions of the gracious promises of God made to Father Abraham, that in his Seed (Christ, and His elect Body, the Church), “all the families of the earth shall be blessed.” —Gal. 3: 8, ,16, 29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Blessed and Holy Are They Who Have Part in the First Resurrection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This brings us to the Scriptural proposition, that there is a first, a chief or special resurrection, and a general one later. The: first or superior resurrection includes the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and of the entire elect “Church which is His Bqdy”—no more, no less. - “Blessed and holy are all they that have part in the First Resurrection; on such the Second Death hath no power, but they shall be kings and priests unto God and shall reign on the earth”—the Messianic Kingdom class. Those who will share in this • First Resurrection will experience an instantaneous “change” from the human nature to the Divine nature --the highest of the' spirit natures ; not human, not ' flesh and blood, for “flesh and blood cannot inherit the ; Kingdom of God.”<a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark12">3</a></sup> Theip trial and perfecting of</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">And likewise the world of mankind, even though they know not of the Lord as yet, are spoken of as being “asleep in Jesus,’ because, as the whole world was under condemnation of death through Adam, and that without knowledge or volition on their part, at the</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">But as the First Resurrection is the resurrection of the blessed and holy, of the sanctified in Christ Jesus, His Body, so the general resurrection, which is for the world, is designated as “a resurrection of judgment,’’ mistranslated in our common version “resurrection of damnation.’’ It is styled a “resurrection of judgment” because, while all the preparation has been made, so far as God is concerned, for granting to the world of mankind a full resurrection or restitution back to all that was first given to Adam, and lost by his disobedience, to be recovered by our Saviour’s precious blood, yet there are certain conditions attached to this blessing upon which it depends, namely, the conditions of the New Covenant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">which once held them is departing, and there is a dis<sup>J </sup>position to doubt everything. People are in the condition of mind where they say, “Let us eat, drink and be merry”; nobody knows about the future; the preachers are all confused. Everything, has come about by evolutionary processes. Let us enjoy the present.. Let pleasure be our aim in life. This would seem to be the attitude of the world. They are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These conditions of our day make it a perilous time for the Church. Do you ask, Would not the Church, on the contrary, be more than ever led to love God? And would this not guard them and keep them from danger? We answer that some of God’s people are becoming more and more immersed in the world. The spirit of the world surges all around them. With great difficulty could these come to realize that the whole world is astray in their ideas and ways. The tendency of all such is to have the mind of the world, even though they be spirit-begotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This worldly spirit, the Apostle suggests, will affect the Church to some extent. Consequently some of the Lord’s people will thus come into special peril at this time, because of neglecting their Covenant with, the Lord. Others will watch and pray, and, for this reason, develop in mind and heart. But these are few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Great Company class, while still loving the Lord, are becoming immersed in the spirit of the world. Even those who are living nearest to the Divine standard will be more or less imperiled through this spirit, unless they continue diligent in prayer and the study of God’s Word. What we see going on about us seems</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4">The expression, “the last days,” refers,-not to the end of the world as many expect this event, but is a Scriptural designation of the present time, the end of this Age, when the Reign of Righteousness is about to begin. “The Harvest is the end of the Age.” (Matthew 13: 39.—Diaglott.) The warning given by the Apostle is that, instead of the world’s being converted to God at this time, the reverse condition will prevail. It will b? a time of‘great peril for those who have started out to follow Christ. It will apt be so perilous a time for the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The only ones who are on trial for life or death are those who have been released from the Adamic condemnation. To these the time described by St. Paul will be one of severe testing. The whole course of the world will be turned aside from the high standard that might have been expected. Meh will be traitors. Only as long as it will be of advantage to them to perform a contract will they do so. . It will be a. time when every man’s hand will be lifted against his neighbor. Selfishness will be rampant. There, will be manifest headiness and self-conceit. Men will be “lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.” This, condition is to be a sign of the end of the Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prevalence of These Conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every thoughtful person must perceive that this condition of things is prevailing now. Whenever, a contract is found to be unsatisfactory—whether it be. a marriage contract or a business contract—the dissatisfied contractor is liable to break the agreement. This party to the contract then assumes the attitude of one who declares, Force me to keep it if you can. The Lord’s people will be firm for principle and true to their contracts, even when these prove disadvantageous. This attitude is pleasing to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We find headiness of spirit in the world everywhere—• a loss of respect for authority. No doubt there has been too much respect for authority in the past. Now there is none. This condition has been brought about by a lack of reverence for God—the inevitable result of loss of faith in the Bible as the Word of God. As people lose faith in the Bible, they lose faith in God, and become more selfish and more self-willed. This condition of affairs has been brought about by false doctrine. People think that God is purposing to do them ; harm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Higher Critics have been seeking to put away what they consider the absurdities of religious thought, and to this end have done away with the Bible. Bible students see that the absurdities have. been brought about by the creeds and not by the Bible. . But the world, losing confidence in God, are becoming more heady than ever before. Even the reverential fear</span></p>

Hence when the world iS&quot;awaken-ed from the sleep of death, it will not signify resurrection, but much less; for resurrection, in its full, complete, Scriptural sense, signifies a .complete raising up, out of sin and out of death, to perfection of being, perfection of life.</span></p>

The surrounding conditions of society will then .be greatly improved; knowledge will have taken the place of ignorance, and. the reign of righteousness and the law of love' will at that time have superceded the rule of sin under the law of selfishness; and Satan will be bound, that he shall deceive the nations no more for the thousand years. Under the favorable conditions of that Mediatorial Kingdom, all mankind will bg^required to make progress in the knowledge of the Lord and in the bringing of their own hearts and lives into accord with His law of Love. Whosoever then will make no effort in the right direction will be cut off from life, in the Second Death, after one hundred years of trial (Isa. 65: 20), although he would then, under the changed conditions, be properly reckoned as only a lad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But while judgment will thus pass against one who fails to make progress, and will cut short his further opportunity, the same judgment, by the same Judge, will operate favorably to all who will seek righteousness, . and make progress in harmony with the laws of the Kingdom; so that year by year they Will be growing mentally, physically and morally stronger——approximating gradually the full, complete standard of perfect manhood, the .image and likeness of the Creator, as first represented in Father Adam. Thus the resurrection, so far as the world is concerned, will be a gradual’ work; its first step an awakening from the sleep of unconsciousness and nonentity; its succeeding steps will be along the lines of judgment, the conduct of those who are on trial being either approved or disapproved; and culminating either in their sentence to the Second Death, incorrigible, and unworthy of the gift of God, eternal life—or in their perfection, and their final adjudgment of worthiness to have and enjoy the great boon of Life Eternal, under the blessed conditions which are then promised to prevail—when there shall be no more sighing, no more dying, no more sin and none of the penalties for sin, for. all the former things shall have passed away.—Rev. 21: 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Some are confused by this expression, “flesh and blood’’; they fail to see that it signifies human nature; we therefore invite such to examine the use of the same phrase elsewhere, by the same New<sup>1</sup> Testament writers. In so doing they will be convinced that our definition, human nature, is the .correct one, the Scriptural one. See the following uses of the phrase: Matt. 16: 17; John 3: 5, 6; 1 Cor. 15: 50.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">It is for this reason that the millions of newspaper readers continue to enjoy Paster.

<p><span class="font12">What a man believes or disbelieves is his own business, and not subject to public criticism. But when a number of people iilOCA/&quot;&quot; - ’ ciate themselves,, publish their doctrines to the world and invite members, their doctrines are properly subject to public criticism. These should be honestly treated, however, not misrepresented; and all honest people should welcome such truthful criticism. We</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font12">appeal to other Scientists who have a sacred assume that Christian Scientists, therefore, regard for the Bible as a Divine revelation.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">We publish an extract of the report, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- A sensation has been aroused in religious circles in this city by the resignation of Mr. Frederick W. Plaenker, first reader and practitioner of the Christian Science Church of Cumberland.. The announcement of Mr. Plaenker’s withdrawal, coming suddenly, as it did, was something of a shock to the members of his flock, but there was nothing for them to do but accept it, as their leader was determined upon severing his every connection with Mother Eddy’s church, at the same time rejecting all its tenets absolutely. The fact that Mr. Plaenker has been one of the strongest and most active, workers, of the Christian Science church in the city, has made his complete rejection of all of Mother Eddy’s teachings quite remarkable and startling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“For over five years Mr. Plaenker has been an earnest supporter of Mrs. Eddy and Christian Science. He studied in Baltimore, having relinquished a career at the bar to do so, being a graduate of law at the University of Maryland, ’05. Hence, from being one of the most loyal advocates of Christian Science, Mr. Plaenker now becomes one who totally rejects the teachings of that faith, for the following stated reasons:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. “A careful perusal of Pastor Russell’s Studies in the Scriptures has shed more light upon the entire Bible than </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and. Health</span><span class="font12"> has shed upon a single chapter during my five years of close study and practice; notwithstanding the Christian Science text-book, by Mrs. Mary G. Baker.Eddy, bears the.title of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. “Since I understand the Bible to be an expression of God’s Plan, I more and more realize that Christian Science not only fails to reveal that Plan, but even conceals it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. “By its denial that Adam was originally perfect and subsequently fell from that perfection, Christian Science consequently denies:</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">will fully appreciate what we now have to say. We trust that we always have this, attitude toward criticism of our public teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The growth of Christian Science has astonished the world. Its teachings appeal to. a very intelligent, well-to-do class of people, of considerable mental independence. The physical healing of either themselves or their friends seems to have been more or less associated with their conversion to their cult. Their realization of the cure brought them the conviction that there is a supernatural power outside of man, and aroused a religious sentiment such as they had never known before. It seems to them that they have started a new life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The reason for this is that nominal Christianity is merely a form of godliness, without power or conviction. This form of godliness has spread until the whole is styled Christendom—Christ’s Kingdom. In countries like Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Scandinavia approximately ninety-five per cent, of the population are rated as Christians, even though some of these are in prison, some in insane asylums and some too young to think. In Italy everybody is rated a Christian—although amongst some of the Italians who come to our shores flourish works of the Devil, such as the Black Hand, the Mafia, etc.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Bewildered Christendom</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">Additionally, some sincere Christian people have,' during the last fifty years, been in great perplexity because of the stupendous nonsense intermingled with Truth which was handed down from the. Dark Ages. Under the increasing light, thinking people ■ could not swallow some of the monstrous statements of the creeds as readily as did their forefathers. Gradually the great churches which formerly persecuted all others as heretics, forbidding any to preach except by their ordinations, found themselves compelled to desist from making their tenets too prominent. Thus many people have concluded that the only difference between</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>“WHERE ARE THE DEAD?”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">This article was published in a recent issue of The Bible Students Monthly, Vol. 5, No. 3. The interest aroused and the great demand for copies of it have been remarkable. A sample copy will be mailed to any one free upon receipt of post-card request.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">the various denominations is in church forms, ceremonies, ordinations, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The doctrine that God had foreordained 999 out of every 1,000 to an eternity of tor--xture in fire was gradually looked at as too horrible to believe. The alternate doctrine, that God did not foreordain the matter thus,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">• Under such conditions Christian Science was born, and has grown to its present proportions. Three things especially favored it: (1) its acceptance of the Bible; (2) its rejection of everlasting. torment, mental or physical; (3) its teaching respecting Divine healing. . Mrs. Eddy, the acknowledged head of Christian Science, had a keen mind and considerable wisdom. in its exercise. She would hold to the Bible, even though perverting its teachings. She would not make her teachings too antagonistic to other theories. She contented herself with vague, ambiguous statements re the future life. She laid principal stress on healing, and settled all doctrinal difficulties with the dictum that there is no evil, no sin, no death; that what have been so-ealled are merely errors of the mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The very absurdity of these statements advertised them.. People said, What does it .....i'heic. is no death, no -sickness, no pain, no sorrow, no evil of any kind? Absurd! Later;, they said, We will see how Christian Scientists explain death, sickness, pain, sin. Thus curiosity led them into the metaphysical labyrinth which Mrs. Eddy had skilfully constructed. Having no intelligent knowledge of the Bible, they fell an easy prey to “Mother Eddy’s’-’ errors. If some of her definitions were fanciful, far-fetched and un-scriptural, they were no more so than the illogical teachings to which people had been accustomed from childhood.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>C. S. Readers and Practitioners.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">Christian Scientists feel what might be termed spiritual pride in connection with their healing practises and with the public reading of the Scriptures and Mrs. Eddy’s comments—as much spiritual pride as is sometimes felt in the churches by preachers, elders, deacons, vestrymen, deaconesses, etc. Once elevated to positions as readers, practitioners or healing practitioners, it becomes their duty loyally to support the system they represent. And so, just as earnestly as with other sects, the establishment and defense of Christian Science goes courageously onward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Stall another class is interested—those in control of Christian Science literature. It sells at good stiff prices; and anybody questioning the merchandising of the truth is given to understand that he is unappreciative; and with the majority the price regu</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">lates the value.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Is Christian Science Logical?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">Having, we believe, fairly stated the facts and claims of Christian Scientists, we will now endeavor to show why we consider their teachings illogical. “ Mother Eddy ,” striving after a truth, declared that there is no pain, no sickness, no sorrow, etc. The truth she was feeling after, but did not fully grasp, is that sin, sickness, sorrow, death, are abnormal conditions, resulting from the curse that came upon our race at the beginning because of disloyalty to God. We agree with Mrs. Eddy to the extent of saying that these unsatisfactory conditions are not designed by God to be everlasting. He does not recognize them as proper for those in fellowship with Him. Jesus Himself tells us that their</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">obliteration will be the work of His Millennial Kingdom.—Revelation 20:6; 21:4; 22:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Is it wise to say in one breath that these will pass away, and in the next breath that they are non-existent? Surely we all value consistency and logic! Otherwise language would bring us confusion instead of intelligence. Let us then say that these conditions exist because man is out of relationship with God through sin; and that according to the Bible mankind shall be delivered from this</span></p>

Theirs will be the per’ ishing like natural brute beasts, which St. Peter mentions—the punishing with an everlasting destruction, mentioned by St. Paul. (2 Peter 2:12;. 2 Thess. 1:9.) But nothing in the Bible implies an everlasting torture of any one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the Bible presentation there is a special place for the Church of the Gospel Age, called out of the world before the Restitution Times. Her acceptance, of the Call implies her attempt to live in fullest harmony with the Lord under present imperfect; unsatisfactory conditions—even to the extent of laying down life for the brethren, for the service w God and His Word. To this Church class, the Bible assures us, will come a still higher blessing than. Restitution. The Church is tp have the highest form of spirit nature* as St. Peter declares.-’—2 Petei l.-l.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Truth Biblical, Scientific, Sanctifying</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">We commend Christian Scientists for their endeavor to hold fast to the Bible, but remind them that not the letter of the Bibi*, merely will enlighten and sanctify, but ste ..... spirit, its real meaning.. This is obtainable^ not. by confusing definitions, but by sins-plicity of mind in accepting the words fos?. what they are and putting them together illogical order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Let us give Mrs. Eddy credit -for desiring to be logical; but let us notice that her language was confusing when she said, ‘ ‘ There is no death, no sickness, no pain.” The most that .can.be conceded by the most generOTS logician is that there should be no deaths no sickness, no pain, no sorrow, if things wera in right condition. But things are not he. right condition, as the Bible declares and w all can see; and they will not be so until th® Savior who redeemed the world by the sacrifice of Himself shall assume His kingly and. remove the curse. Then there will b® no sin, no death, no sorrow, no pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But since Mrs. Eddy and Christian'So| ence fail to recognize and statq 'these-<sub>;</sub>.feas6i|J clearly it follows that, howevergiaitractiv*]' her teachings, may be to some'people,\thegq cannot be relied, upon, because they are o» the true foundation—recognizing neither th® facts of sin and death nor the necessity 'let redemption therefrom by Jesus’ sacrifice nor for the coming Restitution. Furthermore'<sub>; </sub>Christian Science does not differentiate b©« ’ tween the Church, which has been in process' of selection for more than eighteen centuries/ and the world, which still lies in the Wickeffi. One, and which will not be dealt with un® the Church shall be glorified, and with heiE ' Lord shall constitute the Kingdom of Righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jesus prayed for His Church, “SanctiJsr them through Thy Truth; Thy Word fe Truth.” While Christian Scientists an® , people of other denominations, and some: heathen as well, are, many of them, moraL . exemplary, honorable, yet few claim to bi sanctified. Indeed, the sanctifying features of Truth they ignore or do not see. We not to think of church attendance or of jection of profanity, liquors, etc., as sanctification.. The putting away of the filth of'the' flesh is indeed commendable, but is only &amp;, primary step in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">God is now calling a sanctified class—aaefe-apart, people—whom He is testing under ths promise, “Be thou faithful unto death, airi&gt; I will give thee a Crown of Life.” This doss not signify faithfulness to a denomination or a cult, but faithfulness to the Lord, -to'th®» testimony of His Word, to the principles cf righteousness, to self-surrender to walk ia Jesus’ footsteps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We will not discuss at length the scientific . element of Christian Science. To some it &gt;&nbsp;seems very unscientific—inharmonious witi '</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">“All my reasons for rejecting Christian Science may be briefly summarized thus: If the Bible is true, many principles of Christian Science are utterly false, and I must recognize that either the one or the other must be rejected. I therefore reject Christian Sci-®nce, and in obedience to candid conviction and conscience I accept the Bible as the inspired Word of God, the Revelation of the Divine Plan of the Ages.

We believe that the only way that anything scientific could be associated with it is by adding to it the thought that sorrow, sin and death are in the world only temporarily, by reason of transgression of Divine Law, and that they are to be exterminated by Messiah’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>A Very Pernicious Teaching.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">Christian Scientists tell us that they have benefited mentally and physically from following Mrs. Eddy’s theory and denying that there is any pain, etc. We quite agree that the will is a powerful factor in resisting disease—that if we brood over sorrows, difficulties, aches and pains, they are increased by the operation of our minds. . We agree with all physicians, that the mind should be diverted from our diseases. But it is</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">Scientists—and by many of other denominations—that is very pernicious, very injurious, very untrue, very unscientific, very unscrip-tural. This is the teaching that God is omnipresent—present in everything and in every place. Nothing in the Bible so declares; and when we attempt to be wiser than what is written we surely make a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Whoever thinks of God as omnipresent necessarily thinks of Him as impersonal; and the more he thinks the more vague his God becomes, until finally he has no God, but merely (as some Christian Scientists, including Mrs. Eddy, express it) believes in a principle of good and calls that principle God. Such wish to believe in a supreme Creator, but by this erroneous reasoning they mislead their own intelligence, into the denial of a personal God. An omnipresent God is</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font12">not a person.</span></p>

Therefore the Church should not expect Divine healing, which is so much of Restitution and will be-long to the world by and by, after Messiah’s Kingdom shall have been established. But Restitution is not the promise to the Church, but a new nature, the Divine; and that Divine nature is obtainable only by participation with the Redeemer in ‘ ‘ the sufferings of this present time” and in “the glory to follow.”—Romans 8:18, 19.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Healing in the Early Church</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">Neither Jesus nor His Apostles experienced healing—nor did any of the early Church, so far as the record shows. Dorcas, who was raised from the dead, and St. Peter’s wife’s mother, who was healed of a fever, are not to be considered exceptions to this rule. Nor was this, because none of them were sick. Jesus Himself evidently was very sick in Gethsemane, and on the way to the Cross he fainted. St. Paul mentions Trophimus and how sick he was; yet there is no suggestion that the Apostle healed him. St. Paul notes \ the fact that St. Timothy had dyspepsia; but instead of healing him the Apostle wrote ’ to him advising a certain diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We must not think of these things as acci-dental; for they are in full accord with what is abundantly set forth in the Bible.

<p><span class="font12">“For several years a Trustee of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, New York City, . as well as musical director of the choir, I naturally became conversant with many phases of Christian Science in addition to those familiar to the average member or trained student. The inconsistencies, both of doctrine and of practice, which came to my notice during the eight years of my membership (1892 to 1900), forced me to choose between withdrawing or stifling my conscience. I left the church, not knowing where to go. For several years thereafter, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font12">was ‘without Christ, a stranger from the ©©venants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.’ (Ephesians i:12.)

<p><span class="font12">sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any i more pain. ” (Rev. 21:4.) He said in part: i In ur address of last week, having, we be- ' lieve, fairly stated the facts and claims of Christian Science and having pointed out the 1 unreasonableness and inconsistency of some of its statements, we now proceed to inquire whether its teachings are Scriptural. This is the question of special interest to us. The others are merely incidental. We hold, and will endeavor t© show, that Christian Science is in confliet with the Holy Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Bible distinctly avers that God created man perfect—in His own likeness, morally, intellectually. . It declares that Adam’s disobedience was sin, punishable, not with eternal torment, but with death.—Romans 5:12; 6:23; 1 Corinthians 15:21, 22; Genesis 2:17; 3:17-19; Ezekiel 18:4, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Christian Science denies these facts, declaring that there is no death and that whoever dies merely commits “mortal error.” It is surely against Christian Science, but confirmatory of the Bible teaching, that for more than six thousand years mankind have been dying. Even “ Mother Eddy, ’’who was expected not to commit “mortal error,” finally succumbed to it. What answer can our Christian Science friends make to this? We know of none, except that they might claim that the unreasonableness of their position is no greater than the unreasonableness of any of the other sects , and creeds. Logic never seems to be taken into consideration in religious matters; the more illogical a statement, the more commendable the acceptance of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If all disease is error, if death is the greatest of errors, and if the escaping of “mortal error”—death—brings the reward of everlasting life, how do our Christian Science friends expect to get everlasting life, when at the last moment of their trial they make failure? For those of them who are at all logical, this must he another very perplexing problem. The Bible declares that whoever fails in one point is guilty of all the Law. (James 2:10.) Surely he who commits “mortal error” has failed in attaining the desideratum of Christian Science more than in all the other failures of his life in combating all other things! If “mortal error” thus takes hold at the dying moment, what hope would there he for such a person as respects everlasting life, if only to overcomers will be granted that life and if none of them overcome, but all succumb to “mortal error”? The corollary of the argument would be hopeless death for all mankind. In this conclusion the Bible agrees. “ The wages of sin is death”; sin brings death, “mortal error.” —Ezekiel 18:4; Genesis 2:17; Romans 6:23.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>What the Scriptures Say.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">The Bible logically and beautifully points out God’s compassion for our race and His provision in Christ for our recovery out of this death condition by a resurrection from the dead. The <sub>r</sub> Bible logically shows that the Divine sentence of death (not torment)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">a declaration that the sin leading to “mortal error” is atoned for by Divine favor, to the intent that all sinners may be rescued from “mortal error”—from death?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Bible is so much more reasonable and beautiful that, we believe, Christian Scientists, seeing its teachings with clear vision, will gladly exchange an inferior for a superior. Why should they bind themselves too closely to “Mother Eddy,” who according to her own theory failed in the highest degree, in committing “ mortal error”—and hopelessly? Would they not rather take the older and still better teaching of God’s Word, and realize that Jesus’ Resurrection from the dead was the Divine recognition of His perfect sacrifice and a guarantee that His death had accomplished the designed purpose of providing a way for the removal of “mortal error”— death—from all?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Those who accept Jesus’ death and resurrection as the satisfaction provided by God for sin, and who believe the Bible teaching that the actual resurrection is to occur after the Second Advent of Jesus, may by faith speak of themselves as already risen with Him. But those who deny that there is any death must of necessity deny that Jesus died, and hence would be, whether intentionally or otherwise, denying the Ransom-Price—the Redemption-Price—given for the sins of the whole world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Cannot our Christian Science friends accept the Redeemer and His work, and by faith look forward to the Restitution, which St. Peter declares will follow our Lord’s Second Advent? (Acts 3:19-21.) It will be for all mankind, and will last a thousand years, dealing with “every man in his own order”—bringing them back from the tomb and from all their weaknesses, which are the blemishes of sin—back to the perfect image and likeness of God, as originally represented in Father Adam.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Healing the Sick Not a Sin</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">Christian Science healers necessarily acknowledge that there is sickness when they speak of healing; for how could any one be healed who is not diseased? We have already conceded that sickness, sorrow and pain would not be proper for any who are God’s people; and that the prevalence of these conditions attests the fact that God is dealing with the world as criminals under death sentence. The question arises, Is not the Church an exception to the world in this matter? We answer that those who believe in Jesus’redemptive work and who fully consecrate their lives are counted as separate and distinct from the world. (John 17:16.) Nevertheless, to the surprise of some, it is not the Divine Plan that those received by God as sons should be released from sickness, imperfection or death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Take the case of Jesus: “Holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,” the Son of God by a full outward attestation (Matthew 3:17; John 1:14), He was weary, He hungered, He agonized in the Garden, He died on the Cross. Nor were these errors; rather, they</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">the Church. Even Jesus Himself did not &lt;&nbsp;heal all who needed aid. At the Pool of Bethesda there were many impotent folk; ’ but. He healed one only. (John 5:5-9.) ' He informed us that His work was merely a j sample of what Restitution will be in due <sup>! </sup>time, when Messiah’s Kingdom shall pre- -vail worldwide: “These things did Jesus, and manifested beforehand His [coming] ' glory”—His Kingdom work at His Second । Advent, when He will be the great Healer, ; the great Life-Giver, for all of Adam’s race, i •—John 2:11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Seme one may inquire, Pastor Russell, ; have you forgotten Mark 16:17,18? “These j signs shall follow them that believe: In My | name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No; we do not forget that these words are accredited to Jesus and St. Mark; but all scholars know, or should know, that these words do not appear in any Greek manuscript of earlier date than the Seventh Century. Besides, we doubt whether all Christian Scientists claim to be healers, or whether even the healers would handle serpents or drink poisons, such as prussic acid. This is not Higher Criticism. I am not a Higher Critic. It is the simplest form of criticism to reject frauds and impositions when we have proof that they are such, as in this case. We are glad to acknowledge, however, that the number of such fraudulent additions to God’s Word is comparatively small. John 21:25 is another of these; and its absurdity is manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another important fraud is found in 1 John 5:7, 8, where unscrupulous men sought to establish the false doctrine of the Trinity; for not one. text of Scripture could be found to its support. Here they have added twenty-four words of the text, which in the oldest MSS. reads, “For there are three that bear record, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one [record].” As usual, all these spurious additions involve absurdities. In this text the absurdity would be to have Father, Son and Holy Spirit all bearing witness in Heaven to the angels that Jesus is God’s Son, as though the angels would not know that fact!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>The God of the Bible.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">Christian Scientists declare that the ten most potent words ever written were penned when Mrs. Eddy wrote the first ten words of her “Scientific Statement of Being”— “ There is no life, truth, intelligence, nor substance in matter.” How does this agree with their teaching that God is everywhere and in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">everything?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It further declares that God is a Principle, yet discusses Him as a personality, quoting, “God is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity.” (Habakkuk 1:13.) On the strength of this misapplied text Christian Scientists build the theory that God is ignorant of everything impure or injurious; that to Him and to them such things are not realities. .Nevertheless, the context contradicts all their theories by declaring, “Wherefore iookest Thou upon them that deal treacherously, and boldest Thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?”— Hab. 1:13; see also V. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Christian Science is in conflict with the Bible along another very important line. According to Christian Science, “God is </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">divine Principle, supreme incorporeal Being, Mind, Spirit, Soul, Life, Truth, Love. These are synonymous terms. They refer to one absolute God, and nothing else. The attributes of God are justice,, mercy, wisdom, goodness, and so on. Principle is divine, one Life, one Truth, one Love, and this is God, omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent.” ♦ * * “Soul, or Spirit, signifies Deity, and nothing else. There is no finite •oul, or spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> But the God of the Bible is a Person, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">Spirit. Jesus said, “God is </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">Spirit; and they that worship Him must worship Him in</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">' spirit and in truth.” (John 4:24.) God is </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">Person, or Soul: “If any man draw back, ' My Soul shall have no pleasure in him.” (Hebrews 1:3; 10:38.) He is “the God of i all grace, the Father of mercies,” from whom i cometh every good and perfect gift.” (2</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">where. Since the invention of the telephone and the wireless we may much better than ever before understand how God can have fullest knowledge of everything throughout the Universe, just as man can receive information in an instant from the remotest parts of the earth. What man can do under Divine guidance and enlightenment is, we may be sure, as nothing in comparison with what his Creator can do with that Creator’s power and knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In conclusion, we urge upon Christian Scientists, as upon all professing the name of Christ, the importance of coming into relationship with Jesus by faith: First, faith in Him as the Redeemer—the One through whom alone there is provision for escape from sin, sorrow, sickness, death; secondly, belief in Him as the great King whose Reign is to accomplish the work of overthrowing sin; thirdly, belief in the testimony of Jesus and the Apostles that He is gathering put </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font12">Church to be His Bride, or Associate, in His glorious Messianic work of a thousand years —yea, and to be His Companion in glory to all eternity.—Ephesians 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Let us become, through Christ, through consecration, through Spirit-begetting, the children of God, that we may properly call Him our Father and properly expect and receive His parental care over all our affairs, temporal and spiritual. Let us remember that the glory, honor, immortality and Divine nature, promised to the elect saints, are to be attained only by those who shall demonstrate their love and loyalty to God by faithfulness in His service even unto death, as did our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">Corinthians 1:3; Janies 1:17.) All these expressions tell us of personality, as do those Scriptures which declare His Justice, Wisdom, Power and Love. These qualities are not properly attributable to a good principle; for principles of right and wrong have no personality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Man was made an earthly image of his Creator, who is a Spirit. Man was made “ a little lower than the angels” (Hebrews 2:9; Psalm 8:5); for, although the angels have God’s likeness also, they have it on the spirit plane. The likeness is not necessarily one of form, but of character and of organism to the extent that man can reason with God and appreciate God’s revelations respecting moral and religious things. Other animals, not in God’s image, cannot reason on those subjects and cannot be appealed to as man can. To humanity God says, “ Come now, let us reason together.”—Isaiah 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A personal God must have a place </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">of presence, as</span><span class="font12"> suggested in Jesus’ prayer, “Our Father, which art in Heaven.” For God to be </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">everywhere,</span><span class="font12"> as Christian Scientists and others assert, would make Him impersonal—■ a Principle. This wrong thought is held by many who, contrary to the Bible, declare that God is </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">omnipresent,</span><span class="font12"> everywhere present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While God is not omnipresent, everywhere present, He is omniscient; that is, He has knowledge ©f everything and of every place; as it is written, “The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good. ’ ’ (Proverbs 15:3.) We know that there are both evil and good to behold; and that the eyes of the Lord represent His intelligence, taking cognizance of everything every</span></p>

His principal error is in the use of the thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and word “mistakenly.” Christian people who earth, because thou hast hid these things from know their Bibles understand very well that the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them the gifts of healing possessed by the early unto babes.” (Matt. 11:25.) “For ye see Church were bestowed upon it as a means your calling, brethren, how that not many for its introduction to the attention of manwise men after the flesh, not many mighty, kind, some one ©r more gifts being conferred^ not many noble are called.”—1 Cor. 1:26. <sub>a</sub>t the hands of the Apostles, upon all who</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">The fourth point Rev. T omhnson makes is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>R</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font12">that Christian Science does not deny the true Rev. Tomlinson goes on to say: “ In His personality of God. . Hear Mrs. Eddy on farewell address to the members of His this point: “Jehovah is not a person. God is church, the Master said as reported in the principle.” Principle is “life, truth, loye, last chapter of Mark: ‘These signs shall folsubstance and intelligence.” “In divine low them that believe; in my name they Science, God and men are inseparable, as shall cast out devils; they shall speak with Principle and its idea.” “Woman is the new tongues; they shall take up serpents, and highest term for man.” There you have if they drink any deadly thing it shall not it. Mrs. Eddy is God! She has proved iW hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick Nothing could be more simple.. Now hear and they shall recover.’” Right here is where the Word of the Lord: “Thus saith Jehovah, Rev. Tomlinson stuck his foot into it, in thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee bad shape, for all careful Bible students know from the womb; I am Jehovah that maketh that the last twelve verses of the Book of all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens Mark are wanting in the Sinaitic and Vatican alone [without Mrs. Eddy’s help]; that MSS., the oldest and most authentic copies spreadeth abroad the earth by myself; that of the New Testament in existence. It is frustrateth the tokens ®f the liars and maketh evident that Mark’s gospel was completed diviners mad; that turneth wise men back- for him about five centimes after he wrote it, ward, and maketh their knowledge foolish.” for the Alexandrine MS., written in the fifth —Isa. 44:24, 25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. century, is the oldest Greek MS. which con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Rev. Tomlinson’s fifth point is that it does tains these verses. Read these spurious not deny the Atonement. Hear Mrs. Eddy verses carefully, note the marginal reading on this point: “Not the death of the cross, in the Revised Version, note their untruth-but the cross-bearing deathless life, that Jesus fulness in the light of facts, and, mark them in left for the example of . mankind, ransoms your Bible. I feel constrained to say to Rev. from sin all who follow it.” Now hear the Tomlinson that this is very bad “Science.” Word of the Lord: “ Forasmuch as ye know It would have to go under the classification that ye were not redeemed with corruptible referred to by the Apostle when he warned things, as silver and gold; but with the pre- Timothy against the erroneous teachings of</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">-cious blood of Christ.” (1 Peter 1:18, 19.) “Science falsely so called.”—1 Tim. 6:20.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Women Not Always Messengers of Light</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">. Rev. Tomlinson’s final point is that “ Christian Science was discovered and founded by a woman,” and “in the churches of this denomination man and woman unite in the conduct of the Sunday services.” Right here he shows again that Mrs. Eddy’s book, and not the Bible, is the true text-book of the movement in which he is interested. No one held woman in higher esteem than Our Lord, yet when choosing His twelve Apostles, and later the seventy, He included none of them. . Nor were any female members of the tribe of Levi eligible to the priestly office. The first woman was Satan’s first ambassador—a successful one, too, in misleading the first man and plunging the entire race into sin and death. The Divine Program runs counter to the natural tendency of all men to specially esteem woman in religious matters. This tendency is notable in the records of the past as well as the present, as evidenced by the Egyptian goddess Isis, the Assyrian goddess Ashtaroth, the Greek goddess Diana, the Roman goddesses Juno and Venus, the worship of Mary, the mother of Jesus, the use of women as mediums in Spiritualistic seances, and finally the exaltation of Mrs. Eddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hear the Word of the Lord: “Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.” This is in accord with the wishes of the best women ©f all ages. The true woman desires to retreat from the limelight of publicity, and to put the responsibility for Christian instruction where it properly belongs, upon the half of the human family that is best fitted to impart such instruction without the damage to character and disposition which so soon mars the womanhood of the gentler sex, when they take up duties f@r which they were not by nature designed,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">and from which they are prohibited by the ! Word of God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In conclusion, let me urge that the true Christian does not need Mrs. Eddy’s text- ' book. He has an infinitely better one, namely, “The Word of God, whichlivethand abideth forever.” (1 Peter 1:23.) It is not Mrs. Eddy’s book, but it is “ The Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.” (2 Tim. 3:15.) It is through &gt;&nbsp;them alone “That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Let the Shadows Flee Away</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was the Word of Ged, made clear to me some years ago, through reading the Scripture Studies series of Bible helps, that led me to see how un-Scriptural is this Christian Science theory, and how unscholarly and unscientific. Christian Science teaches that the meaning of certain wordsis as follows: Adam........ A damn, or error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Eve..........Evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">God......... .Good, or Principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Israel.........Is Real.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Mary.........Sweet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now that all may see just how childish is this method of twisting words, I give the exact meaning of each of the foregoing words in the Hebrew, from which they were taken: Adam........ Of the Ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Eve..........Life-Giving ©r Life Sustainer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">God..........Mighty One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Israel.........Ruling with Ged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Mary.........Bitter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the case of the meaning of the word</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Mary, it comes from the Hebrew “Marah,” and its only meaning is “Bitter.” Turn to Exodus 15:23, and read f@r yourself: “And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore, the name of it was called Marah.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PRINCIPLES OF DIVINE LAW</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&quot;VY/HILE seeking t© follow the various specific commands of Scripture, let us seek mere and more to understand and came in sympathy with the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">principles which underlie</span><span class="font12"> the Divine Law. These will enable us t© judge ©f the right and the wrong of such of ©ur words, thoughts and acts as may net be particularly specified in the Lord’s Word. Indeed, as we come to understand and . sympathize with the principles ef Divine Law, t© that extent we are getting the spirit ©f the Divine Word. Note the testimony ©f the Psalmist ©n this point, “G, hew I love thy law! It is my meditation all the day. Thou, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">through thy commandments,</span><span class="font12"> hast made me wiser than mine enemies, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">for they are ever with me.</span><span class="font12"> I have more understanding than all my teachers, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">for thy testimonies are my meditation.</span><span class="font12"> I understand mere than the ancients, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">because I keep thy precepts.</span><span class="font12"> I have refrained my feet from every evil way, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">that I might keep thy Word.</span><span class="font12"> I have not departed from thy judgments, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">for thou hast taught me. How sweet are thy words unto my taste!</span><span class="font12"> yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Through thy precepts</span><span class="font12"> I get understanding; </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">therefore, I hate every false way. Thy Word</span><span class="font12"> is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”—Psa. 119:97-105.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">A certain amount of combative courage is demanded in overcoming the world, the flesh and the Devil and their various snares. This fighting disposition may become a valuable aid to ourselves and t@ the Master’s cause if rightly and wisely directed against sin, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font12"> in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">ourselves</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">secondly</span><span class="font12"> in others; if used for the Lord and his people and against Satan and all his powers of darkness and superstition. This, in the Scriptures, is called fitting the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">good fight,</span><span class="font12"> and we all should be gallant soldiers in this battle for Right and Truth, lovingly defending ©ur Captain’s honor and his people’s liberties.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Not Trust to Conscience Alone</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If conscience were a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">sufficient</span><span class="font12"> guide you would have no need of the Scriptures. The majority of people have as good as no conscience; for they are blind t© the principles and laws ©f God given to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">guide</span><span class="font12"> conscience; and still worse off than these are those mentioned in 1 Tim. 4:2.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS IS NOT AN ADVERTISEMENT, BUT AN EDITORIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">“STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Is the general title of a series of Six intensely interesting volumes from the well-known pen of Pastor Russell. They now enjoy a circulation of over eight million copies, in 19 principal languages of the world. For a candid, lueid presentation of the Bible’s teaching, we believe these volumes cannot be surpassed. The contrast between the true God held forth in STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES and the God of the creeds is so marked that the public is taking notice, and thousands upon thousands from all schools and denominations are testifying to the blessings received by these writings. “The Existence of a Supreme Intelligent Creator ” is the subject of an entire chapter, “ The Bible a Divine Revelation ” is another, while “The Permission of Evil” is discussed invincibly, and in a manner sure to satisfy all who believe the Bible to be God’s Word of Truth. Note a few extracts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“God’s purpose in permitting evil was to make manifest the perfection, majesty and righteousness of His moral law. . . Again, God designed to permit evil, because, having the remedy already provided for man’s release. He saw the result would be to lead him through experience to a full appreciation of the exceeding sinfulness of sin and to the matchless brilliancy of virtue in contrast with it—thus teaching him to love his Creator, the source and fountain of all goodness, and to shun forever that which brought so much woe and misery to the human family.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Right and wrong, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">as principles,</span><span class="font10"> have always existed and must exist; though the right principle </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font10"> will forever continue to be active. When the activity of the evil principle has accomplished its purpose it shall forever cease, and all who continue to submit to its control shall forever cease to exist. Right-doing and. right-doers only shall continue forever.”—1 Cor. 15:25,26; Heb. 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BIBLE STUDENTS MONTHLY, seeking to uphold God’s Word at any cost, seeks to shed abroad “The Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">God, as it shines in the face of Jesus Christ our Lord.” We hereby commend to our thousands of readers a careful study of the six volumes of STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES, which unlock the secrets of God’s great Plan.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">FOLLOWING the appearance of a letter * by C. J. Woodworth, published in The Bible Students Monthly; Vol. IL, No. 5; under the caption “ Christian Science Unscientific and Unchristian,''’ as clipped from the Scranton (Ba.) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font12"> of several gears ago, we have received various protests</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">•om Mr. Robert S. Ross, chairman of the Christian Science Committee on Publication, New York City; asking that the article in question be suppressed. That our readers may have full benefit of the points at issue, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font12">are publishing the protest and the author’s reply, as well as a reprint of the controverted article. (See page 3.)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>MR. ROSS’ ARGUMENT</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Mr. Ross’complaint fellows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“.In regard to the article in Vol. II., No. 5, by Clayton J. Woodworth, permit me to state:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“1. There is nothing in the teachings of Jesus to indicate that they were not intended to be understood by all mankind. . If the teachings of Christian Science have, in some eases, been adopted by learned and cultured people, it is indicative of their reasonableness. Anybody who is familiar with the makeup of Christian Science congregations knows that the teachings of Christian Science have appealed to both the rich and poor, the high and the low. Love is no respecter of persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">‘ ‘ 2. Mr. Woodworth refers to the growth of Christian Scienee, infers that it is the work of the devil; and then quotes several passages from the Scriptures to back up his </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">ipse dixit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“3. Mr. Woodworth refers to the financial prosperity of the Christian Science Movement, infers that this is also a sign of evil, and again quotes passages from the Bible to substantiate his opinion, quite overlooking the words of the.Psalmist, ‘Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ung</span><span class="font12">odly; . . .he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.’ It is quite natural that an organization which is made up of people who are trying to do rightly should be as. prosperous, as a collective body, as the individuals who make up that body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“4. Mr. Woodworth quotes </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health</span><span class="font12"> as stating, ‘Jehovah is not a person. God is principle.’ There is no such passage in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health.</span><span class="font12"> Mr. Woodworth also attributes several other quotations to Mrs. Eddy which do not appear in her writings, and declares most unjustly that Mrs. Eddy believed herself to be God. She never claimed to be more than the discoverer of an eternal Science.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">“5. The quotation, ‘Not the death of the cross, but the cross-bearing deathless life, that Jesus left for the example of mankind, ransoms from sin all who follow it,’ is pre- <sub>will</sub>lead you <sub>into a</sub>n <sub>trut</sub>h. <sub>The</sub>“Sermon on ^mably from page 271 of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Sc</span><span class="font12"> a ]^<sub>oun</sub>^ j<sub>a</sub> essence of this Science, and .<sup>exact</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eternal life, not the death of Jesus, is</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When the Science of Christianity^aPPearsit <sub>it3 outcome</sub>.»&gt; <sub>A</sub>nd <sub>then</sub> you add, ‘The will lead you into all truth. The S • n forgoing comparison is a fair example of the Mount is the essence of this Science, j<sub>low care</sub>;<sub>esg</sub>^<sub>y eur cr</sub>ifj<sub>c</sub> has quoted from and the eternal hfe, not the death of Jesus, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">g<sub>c</sub>;<sub>ence an</sub>^ Health.'</span><span class="font12"> But what will you is its outcome. The foregoing comparison &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;- - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">is a fair example of how carelessly our critic has quoted from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">“Finally, Mr. Woodworth attributes to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health</span><span class="font12"> meanings of several names which Mrs. Eddy never gave to them, and which do not appear in any of her writings. For instance, he states that the meaning of Eve is‘Evil’; Israel‘Isreal’; Mary‘Sweet,’_______________ ______________</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">etc., all of which are misrepresentations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G<sub>od-</sub>’ H is impossible to answer</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Time will not permit me to refer to Mrs. ^jg <sub>c</sub>harge fully without knowing which Eddy’s definitions of these words, but in q<sub>UO</sub>t<sub>a</sub>tions are claimed as inaccurate, but to cases where she does define names you will gj<sub>ve you no</sub> ground for this statement I will find them m the Glossary of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and</span><span class="font12"> q<sub>UO</sub>f<sub>e</sub> a paragraph from my article, and give the references to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health:</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">“ I have pointed out enough errors m Mr. Woodworth’s article to prove beyond cavil that he evidently wrote to misrepresent Christian Science merely because its teachings differ from his own theological views. It is very easy for an advocate of one system m to see in other systems various types of so-called heretical teachings, and to point to certain passages from the Scriptures to verify his conclusions. I do not desire to challenge your statement that the author of this article is ‘a Christian man of the highest ideals.’ There are a great many sincere religionists who are zealous to do right in ------ —---------- -----------.</span></p>

But you should realize that it places you in a very embarrassing position to accuso-.a gentleman of untruthfulness, and have him afterwards confront you with abundant evidence that his statements were based upon authorized Christian Science publications.

<p><span class="font12">“The fourth point Rev. Tomlinson makes is that Christian Science does not deny the personality of God. Hear Mrs. Eddy on this point: ‘Jehovah is not a person. God is Principle.’ Principle is ‘life, truth, love, substance and intelligence.’ </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">[Science and Health,</span><span class="font12"> Vol. I., p. 167.] ‘In divine science God and man are inseparable, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font12"> principle and its for man’ </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">[Science and Health,</span><span class="font12"> Vol. II., p. 197.]”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">I joined these four statements logically, in</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">“3. If woman is the highest term for man j and if Mrs. Eddy stands pre-eminent above other womens as the discoverer. ©f these ‘ truths,’ I fail to see why her votaries should object t© the conclusion as I expressed it, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.,</span><span class="font12"> that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘Mrs. Eddy is God!</span><span class="font12"> She has proved it!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“You say further, ‘ Mr. Woodworth attributes to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health</span><span class="font12"> meanings of several names which Mrs. Eddy never gave to them, and which do not appear in any of her writings.’ If you will re-examine my article in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Times</span><span class="font12"> you will see I do not claim the quotations are all from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health.</span><span class="font12"> However, of the five illustrations given therein, I have succeeded thus far in locating three (all from Mrs. Eddy’s writings), and search for the others is still going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“1. * God.... Good, or Principle.’ See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health;</span><span class="font12"> Vol. II., p. 80, ‘ I can do more for you than God (Good) has done.’ And again, Vol. I.,p. 167, ‘God is Principle.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“2. ‘Adam... .A-damn, or Error.’ See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health,</span><span class="font12"> Vol. II., pp. 80, 81, ‘Tile history of Adam (or Error) is a dream without </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> dreamer... .the word Adam, divided into two syllables and reading A-damn, indicates more closely the character and curse of the divine spirit.’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“3. ‘Eve... .Evil.’ In </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health,</span><span class="font12"> pp. 584, 585 (1903 edition), you define as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">‘ ‘ DEVIL.............</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evil; Error</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“EVE.................... </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Error</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“You will certainly agree to the old-established axiom that ‘Things equal to the same thing are equal to each other.’ If ‘Error’is a correct definition of both ‘Devil’ and ‘ Eve,’ it follows that they are substantially one and the same; and if </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘Demi’</span><span class="font12"> means Evil I fail to see wherein Christian Scienee is in any way slandered by the conclusion that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Eve</span><span class="font12"> means Evil, according to Mrs. Eddy, as set forth in my article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“I may further say that Mr. F. W. Flaenker, of Baltimore, Md., who for many years was First Reader in one of your assemblies; and a practitioner amongst you, has, at my request, carefully examined my article to which you take exceptions, and assures me that every statement therein made is correct. (Copy of Mr. Plaenker’s letter is appended hereto.) In view of his familiarity with the subject, and your evident unfamiliarity with it, I am bound to accept his statement as truthful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“ It seems to me that the whole foundation of. Christian Science rests on the wrong principle set forth in the following sentence, ‘ This difficulty is overcome only by teaching the student the metaphysical meaning of terms in common use.’ </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Science and Health, </span><span class="font12">Vol. I., p. 12.) Surely any teaching that must rest on special meanings placed on ‘ terms in common use’ should arouse the suspicions of those who are sincere and pure in heart. The Master did net find it necessary to employ so questionable a course, but so taught that ‘the common people heard him gladly.’ Indeed, Mr. Ross, I feel certain that a gentleman who could write a letter giving expression to the high principles voiced in your note would not continue to advocate Christian Science, at all if he were thoroughly acquainted with its teachings, and with the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Now please turn to your Glossary </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Science and Health,</span><span class="font12"> 1903 edition, p. 579), while I endeavor to show you what I mean. Of the contents of this chapter the opening paragraph says: Tt contains the metaphysical interpretation of Bible terms—giving their spiritual sense, which is also their original meaning. ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">“308 E. 20th St., Baltimore, Md.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;Mt. C. J. Woodworth, “ Maplewood, N. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Dear Mr. Woodworth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“I have examined with interest your article, ‘ Christian Science Unscientific and Unchristian,’ as published in The Bible Students Monthly, Vol. II., No. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">5,</span><span class="font12"> which I note is a reprint from the Scranton (Fa.) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times ©f some</span><span class="font12"> years ago. I am also glad of the privilege of noting the criticisms of this article, as offered by Mr. Robert S. Ross, chairman of the Christian Science Publication Committee of New York, and to submit my candid opinion relative thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“The objections which Mr. Ross raises to your letter are but another evidence, to my mind, that no person can understand Christian Science properly until his reasoning faculties are liberated from the distorting influences of its self-denying theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“After five years of close application of each principle of Christian Science, as a Practitioner and Reader and earnest worker, I finally found myself in this predicament: Well, what am I here for? I have rented this, office, have arranged for telephone service, etc., and have set myself apart for— </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">what purpose?</span><span class="font12"> For no purpose other than to enable others to tell me they are suffering and that they wish me to relieve them. But whence come the patients? Is there any sickness in spirit? Is there any pain in perfection? Am I in spirit? Christian Science says that I am. But do I believe that God is all in all? I do. Then am I a consistent practitioner when I encourage myself to believe that there is any sufferer, any one needing my services? No! Then the time has come for me to be honest with myself, and acknowledge that my so-called patients are themselves the objects of my own false sense, according to the entire theory upon which I have built. Should I not rather practise upon </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">myself,</span><span class="font12"> on the basis ©f Mrs.. Eddy’s own statement: ‘The substance, life, intelligence, truth and love, which constitute Deity, are reflected by His creation; and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font12"> (not our patients) shall see this true likeness and reflection everywhere </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">when we subordinate the false testimony of the corporeal' senses to the facts</span><span class="font12"> in spirit.’ </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Science and Health,</span><span class="font12"> p. 516, edition of 1903.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“With all due respect for Mrs. Eddy, I indeed must recognize the inconsistency of her attempt, through </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health,</span><span class="font12"> to ‘ bear consolation to the sorrowing, and healing to&gt; the sick,’ instead of at once proceeding upon the basis of Christian Science herself, to ‘subordinate the false testimony of the corporeal senses’ which deceived her into believing that ‘God [who suffers not a woman to teach in the Church—1 Timothy 2:12] called her to proclaim His Gospel to this Age:’ whereas God Himself (Principle), according to Christian Science, had ne sense of any need of a Christian Science Gospel, or any other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“I now thank our personal, intelligent Creator, JEHOVAH, that He did know our need of redemption from actual sin and death, and sent Jesus to preach a Gospel consistent with itself, with reason, and with His own all-important mission of atonement, by the blood of His cress. I thank God for the works, of Pastor Russell, the careful perusal of which has opened to me the great plan of God, has made me acquainted with my Maker, and has given me the joy and blessedness of a consistent Christian, an experience which Christian Science can neither give nor take away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Your article, to which Mr. Ross objects, I approve as logical, truthful and in every way fair to the presentations of Mrs. Eddy, in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science and Health,</span><span class="font12"> and elsewhere.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">OUR LORD’S GREAT PROPHECY DEPICTING END OF “WORLD”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">GREAT WORLD CHANGES LONG PROPHESIED NOW DUE—BUT “EARTH ABIDETH FOREVER.”—Eccl. 1:4. MATTHEW, TWENTY-FOURTH CHAPTER, MADE PLAIN.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Since the beginning of the war in Europe in the autumn of 1914, and counter-disturbances elsewhere, the attention of Bible Students and secular editors has been directed simultaneously to the great prophecy of Matthew 24, which unmistakably is being fulfilled before our eyes on a most gigantic scale. As this remarkable prophecy is thoroughly elucidated by Pastor Russell in his timely work, “The Battle of Armageddon,” written in 1897, we have secured permission to publish here the chapter from that work which treats it in full. The entire volume is equally interesting and important, containing 720 pp. of live matter portraying the steps leading to the great European conflict and the final outcome of the world’s troubles. See announcement elsewhere in this issue.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Editor.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font9">CR Lord’s words in Matthew 24 form . the most remarkable prophecy of Holy Writ respecting the “Time of the End,” the closing epoch of this Gospel Age, at which juncture of time we now stand. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font9">was uttered near the close of His earthly ministry, when He was endeavoring to prepare His disciples gradually for the New Dispensation, which would be fully introduced after the tragedy of Calvary. He wished them to understand that they must not expect immediately the. honors and glories of the Kingdom, by His faithful. Before these glories and blessings, would come trials and sufferings. He, their Master, the Kin£, must be rejected of Israel and be crucified, in harmony with the prophetic declarations, then Israel would be given over to their enemies, and their holy city and costly temple be utterly destroyed; moreover, His disciples must not expect to be above their Master, exempt from the reproaches and sufferings that fell on Him; but that faithfulness to Him and His teachings would cause them to be hated of all,men for His sake; but finally, though after much tribulation, those faithful unto death would be rewarded, when He would come again to receive them unto Himself and to a share of His glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Teaching along this line our Lord reserved until near the close of His ministry. At first the disciples were disposed to resent this, and to insist (as some do today) that the Lord’s cause must conquer the wprld, as a result of their preaching; and St. Peter went so far as to express the dissent to our Lord, saying, “Be it far from Thee, Lord, this [death and the scattering of Thy people and the triumph of evil generally] shall not be unto Thee.” (Matthew 16:22; Mark 8:31, 32.) But our Lord severely rebuked St. Peter; and all of the disciples seem to have gradually settled down to a realization that the glories of the Kingdom were still remote, and that the Master must go away, and, leaving them, send the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, to guide and keep them until He would come again in the glory of the Father’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was in this attitude of mind and with our Lord’s latest expression with reference to the Temple, still ringing in their ears, that the disciples sought from Him definite information on these points which were not yet clear in their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Three Questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verse 3.—“And as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto Him privately, saying, Tell us (1) When shall these things [the destruction of the Temple, etc.] he? and (2) What shall he the sign of Thy presence<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark0">1</a></sup> and (3) of the end of the world [age]?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Undoubtedly the opportunity and the questions were of Divine providence; for the prophecy was surely meant more for the instruction of God’s people living in this Harvest time, than for those who asked the questions. In studying this the world or so much of “cold love” toward the Lord; and His Truth that they were not worthy of persecution. But judged, by this same standard, and by our Lord’s prophecy, there have been sonqe faithful unto death throughout this Gospel Age;—a “little flock.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Gospel Wltnesr, World-Wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verse 14.-r-</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“And this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations. Then shall the end come.”—Mark 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">.. Here,. £gain,, opr^.pj^lqqrjy sh,Q.wed,, the disciples that the end of the Age was much farther off than they had supposed; that the Message of His Kingdom was to be good tidings, not to Israel only, but to all nations. But this did not imply that other nations would receive the Gospel which Israel had rejected. Rather, we should expect just what we find, that as the god of this world (Satan) blinded Israel, so he would blind the vast majority of other nations, and hinder them from seeing in Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God —and he has. (1 Corinthians 1:24.) If only a remnant of Israel (specially instructed for centuries under the Law) was found worthy to be of the Royal Priesthood, what more could be reasonably expected of the heathen nations, long “without God and having no hope”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is well that we carefully note our Lord’s words—that the Gospel was not to be preached to the nations to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">convert the nations,</span><span class="font9"> but as a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">witness to the. nations,</span><span class="font9"> and to call, and perfect, and gather out of all nations “the Elect.” Later on “the Elect,” as the Kingdom, will bless the nations, opening their deqf ears to the Gospel, and their blinded eyes to the True Light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">witness</span><span class="font9"> has already been given. The Word of the Lord, the Gospel of the Kingdom, has been published to every nation of earth. Each individual has not heard it: but that is not the statement of the prophecy. It was to be, and has been, a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">national</span><span class="font9"> proclamation. And </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the end has come!</span><span class="font9"> “The Harvest </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">is the end </span><span class="font9">of the Age,” our Lord explained. -—Matthew 13 :39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Trouble in End of This Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verses 15, 16.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“When ye therefore shall see the Abomination of Desolation, spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso readeth let him understand), then let them that be in Judea flee into the mountains!”—See Mark 13:14-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Four points in this narrative show that while it may have had a typical application. to the trouble in the end of the Jewish Age, its real or most important application belongs to the trouble with which the Gospel Age terminates. (1) The. reference to the “desolating abomination” mentioned in Daniel’s prophecy. (2) The statement that the trouble will be the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">most severe</span><span class="font9"> the world has ever known or will ever experience. (3) That unless the carnage were cut short there would be </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">no flesh saved.</span><span class="font9"> (4) The context succeeding unquestionably describes events at the end of this Age—events which could not be applied to the end or Harvest of the Jewish Age, and were not fulfilled there. Two of these points de<sup><a href="#bookmark0">1</a></sup> serve special examination.—See Daniel 11:31; 12:11.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9">Prophecy it is very necessary to keep in memory the questions to which it is the inspired answer. The prophecy is given with much similarity by three of the Evangelists, Matthew, Mark and Luke; but since Matthew’s is the most complete and orderly, we follow its narrative in general, bringing forward any modifica-tions noted in the other accounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Beware of False Christs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verses 4, 5.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in ■ My iname, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 'an- Gb ri . .a-nA-sball.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">deceive many.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Gamaliel mentions two of these false Christs in his speech referred to in Acts 5 :36, 37; and history tells us of several others who deceived many Jews. Most notable among these was Sabbathai Levi, of Smyrna, who announced himself A. D. 1648.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Altogether, there have probably been fifty or more false Christs, male and female, and many of them undoubtedly demented^—possessed of evil spirits. But none of these, nor all of them together, can be said to have “deceived many.” Yet it is against the kind which </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“deceive many”</span><span class="font9"> that our Lord cautions us here, and again, later on in this prophecy, in wnich connection we will examine particularly the anti-christs which have deceived many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The History of Eighteen Centuries Briefly Foretold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verses 6-8.-—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“And ye shall. hear of wars and rumors [threats, intrigues] of wars; see that ye he not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, hut the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall he famines and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are primary sorrows.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus briefly did bur Lord summarize secular history, and teach the disciples not to expect very soon His Second Coming and glorious Kingdom. And how aptly I Surely the world’s history is just this—an account of wars, intrigues, famines and pestilences—little else ! Jesus separates the history of the true Church and states it with similar brevity, thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verses 9-12.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Then [during that same period, the Gospel Age] they shall deliver you up to he afflicted, and shall kill you; and ye shall he hated of all nations [peoples] for My name’s sake. And then [during that same period] many shall he offended, and shall hetray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets [teachers] shall rise and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the light of history would it be possible to portray the course of God’s true Church in fewer words? Surely not! The likeness is perfect. “Whosoever will live godly shall suffer persecution,” is the Apostle’s declaration; and whoever has not shared it has every reason to doubt his relationship to God as a son. (Hebrews 12:8.) And so with the Church as a whole, when not persecuted by the Ishmael and Esau class, it has been because there was so much of the spirit of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">Daniel’s prophecy has much to say about an </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Abomination that maketh Deso?-late</span><span class="font9"> in nominal Spiritual Israel; which was set up in power representatively in Papacy, and which has exercised a great and baneful influence of spiritual desolation in the spiritual house or Temple of God, the Church of Christ. This abominable system of error was to continue until the cleansing of the sanctuary class; and beyond that it was to prosper greatly and lead many in nominal spiritual Israel to repudiate the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Ransom-sacriflce,</span><span class="font9"> given once for all; and the result of its overspreading influence would be the desolation of rejected Christendom. “Abomination of Desolation”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The great Abomination of Desolation whose foundation rests in the doctrine of the Mass (which substitutes human performances instead of the great Sacrifice of Calvary, for the cleansing away of sin) is now being supplemented by theories of self-atonement, and these overspreading abominations are backed by such influence and sophistry. as will deceive many—“if it were possible, the very elect”—and be precursors of the destruction of Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As already pointed out </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font9"> Abomination of Desolation which defiled God’® holy place or True Temple, the Church, was the Papal one, the cornerstone o£ which is the blasphemous doctrine of the desolation are old; but so gross was the darkness of error during centuries past that few, if any, could </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">see</span><span class="font9"> it. That the Mass was not seen to be the Abomination, even by the Reformers, is evident; for although the Church of England in her Articles denies the power of the priests to create Christ out of bread and wine,&quot; to sacrifice Him afresh, yet we have no intimation that the enormity of this sinful practice was seen. And Luther, while full of denunciation for many of Papacy’s sins, and falsities, did not see the great Abomination of Desolation to be the Mass. On the contrary, on his return to his church after his stay at Wartburg Castle, finding that the Mass, as well as images and candles, had been discontinued, as being without Scriptural authority, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Luther re-established the Mass!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this view of the matter there is great significance in our Lord’-s words— “When therefore ye </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">see</span><span class="font9"> the Abomination of Desolation </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">having</span><span class="font9"> stood in the holy place, as foretold by Daniel the Prophet (reader consider) ; then let them which be in Judea flee to the mountains.” Here we must remember the parallelism between the two Harvests, the two times of trouble and the two flights; and must consider that Judea would represent Christendom of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Greek word rendered “mountains” may with equal or greater propriety be rendered in the' singular—mountain ; and it is so rendered in a majority of instances in the Common Version. Indeed, to flee </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">out of Judea</span><span class="font9"> (literal) to either a mountain or many mountains seems peculiar since<sup>x</sup>Judea was in fact “a hill country,” and Jerusalem is described as set in the top of the mountains. But to apply our Lord’s words to the present time, and to His people in Christendom, who now, in the light of Present Truth, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">see</span><span class="font9"> the Abomination stand where it ought not—in the holy place—in the stead of the true Sacrifice, is a very simple matter. They should at once flee from the influence of the abomination and from the system falsely styling itself Christ’s (mountain) Kingdom, to the true Mountain or Kingdom, which at this time Christ has returned to set up in glory and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a word, this command to flee, and the description of its trials, can be prop’ erly understood only in connection with the command of Revelation (18:4), “Come out of her, My people, so t.hat you may have no fellowship with her sins, and that you may not receive of her plagues.”—Diaglott.</span></p>

The Lord’s word is, that all temporizing or parleying or human ' reasoning will be dangerous; no time must be lost in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">obeying</span><span class="font9"> as soon as He causes us to see the Abomination of Babylon, and its relationship to all who have named His name. Alas! how many, , failing to heed the Master’s Word, have suffered themselves to be bound hand and foot, so that now flight is almost impossible. But the Master says, “My sheep hear My voice and they follow Me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is another lesson in these verses: They show that some of the Lord’s people </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">are in one </span><span class="font9">place or condition, and some </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font9">another.

<p><span class="font9">Some of the Lord’s people are in the “houses” or church systems of Babylon ; but, as here intimated, they are generally house-top saints, who have , a higher life and experience and faith than merely nominal church members.

<p><span class="font9">This gathering of the Church occurs in what is called a harvest time, at the close of a summer-time of favor. Our Lord explained (Matthew 13 ;30, 37-43) that in this Harvest He would garner His “wheat” and burn the “tares” in a great time of trouble following. It is still the custom in country places to leave the burning off of refuse until the winter. We understand our Lord to mean, then, that we are to seek help and strength to escape from Babylon before the severe winter-time of her trouble comes upon her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let us pray, and labor accordingly, that we be through our flight before the “winter” of trouble comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We should earnestly pray and strive that our flight be not even on the Sabbath day. What Sabbath day? Not the Seventh day of the week, nor the First day; for “new moons and Sabbaths” surely would prove no hindrance to Christians in any physical flight.’ (Colossians 2:16.) The Sabbath here^ meant is the great antitypical Sabbath—the Millennium, the Seventh-thousand-year Sabbath. If we got started on our flight before it began chronologically, so much the more favorable; and the farther we get into it the more difficult it will be to get free and to abandon Babylon, at the very time it needs and pleads most for our help to sustain it. But God has declared that Babylon must fall, and ho power can sustain her ; and no one who realizes how imperfect is her work, and how good and gracious will be the work of the Lord</span></p>

God permits these deceptions for the very purpose of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">separating</span><span class="font9"> the “overcomers” from all others, and merely guarantees us that the Elect will be kept from falling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The claim, “Beheld, He is in the secret chamber,” is already being made by Spiritists;* that they can have face-to-face interviews with the Lord at some of their seances; and that.all who are in sympathy with their views may have the same privilege, etc. What if the caution that, “if it were possible, it would deceive the very Elect,” should be found to mean that the “very Elect” will be subjected to the severest trials in this evil day? “Who shall be able to stand?” (Revelation 6: 17.) The answer through the Prophet is, “He that hath clean hands [an honest life] and a pure heart” [a Conscience void of offense toward God and man] : ... he “shall ascend into the mountain [Kingdom] of the Lord,” . . . and “stand in the holy place.”—Psalm 24 :3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But how shall God’s people know assuredly that these manifestations are not genuine? He has instructed us that His Day will come “as a thief in the night,” that Jesus will be </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">present</span><span class="font9"> unseen by the world superintending the Harvest work— gathering His Elect, etc. How do we know that He will not manifest Himself to His watching people, as so-called Christian Spiritualists claim, in the “secret apartments”—in their seances?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We know that He will not so manifest Himself to us, because (1) His instructions are that we shall be “changed,” made “like Him,” and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">thus</span><span class="font9"> “see Him as He is”; and (2) He forewarned us against these deceptions which would propose to show Him to us in our unchanged or flesh condition, saying, “If they shall say He is in a desert place or in secret apartments, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">believe it not”;</span><span class="font9"> because in no such manner will He be manifested. On the contrary, “As the bright-shiner [the Sun] cometh out of the East [and can neither be confined to a solitary place nor to a private room], but shineth : </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[everywhere]</span><span class="font9"> even unto tbe [remote] West, so shall the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">presence</span><span class="font9"> of the Son ■ of Man be.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">W<sup>T</sup>e answer that they have had a literal fulfilment, and are now having a symbolic fulfilment much more momentous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On May 19, 1780 (still “in those days,” the 1260 years of Papal power, but after that power had begun to wane and the brunt of the tribulation had passed) </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">phenomenal darkening of the sun occurred, for which scientists of that time and since have never been able to account. That this was no ordinary occurrence is sufficiently established by the following competent testimony :</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“Tbe dark day in Northern America was one of those wonderful phenomena of nature which will always be read of with interest, but which </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">philosophy is at a loss to explain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We quote as follows from Judge R. M. Devins, in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Our First Century”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Almost, if not altogether alone, as </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">most mysterious and as yet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">unexplained </span><span class="font9">phenomena of its kind in nature’s diversified range of events during the last century, stands the dark day of May </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">19<sub>s </sub></span><span class="font9">1780, a most unaccountable darkening of the whole visible heavens and atmosphere in New England, which brought intense alarm and distress to multitudes </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">minds, as well as dismay to the brute creation—the fowls fleeing, bewildered, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">their roosts, and the cattle to their stalls.”</span></p>

Similarly all faithful servants of Christ, all earnest laborers for souls, are such as are described in this text as being “with child.” Spiritual child-bearing after the Apostolic example is most honorable service, and engages the attention of some of God’s most devoted children. But alas! as the desire of Abraham and •Sarah to help fulfil God’s promises led to an unauthorized </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">method,</span><span class="font9"> and produced an Ishmael class, which, born after the flesh, persecuted the Seed born legitimately, so is it with many of these who now are “with child”; they are helping to produce illegitimate “children of God.” It should be remembered by all, however, that only legitimate means should be employed ; all the children of God are begotten by the Word and Spirit of the Truth, and not by human theory and the spirit of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">False views of the Divine Plan (the supposition that all except the Elect Church will be everlastingly tormented) have in some so stimulated their desires to bring forth “children” that they have resorted to various human devices for begetting them—overlooking the fact that all not “begotten of God,” all not begotten “by the Word of Truth”—(not merely of the letter of the Word, but “begotten of the Spirit” of the Truth), </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font9">spurious, and not reckoned as of God </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">nor </span><span class="font9">treated as sons. (Hebrews 12:8.) As a consequence the Church nominal of today makes “a fair show in the flesh”—&gt; numerically, financially, intellectually—■ and has much of “the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">form</span><span class="font9"> of godliness” without its real spirit and power to control the heart.

Those inclined ' to quibble by urging that “the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fixed</span><span class="font9"> stars did not fall” are reminded that our Lord said nothing about fixed stars falling, and that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fixed</span><span class="font9"> stars could not fall; their falling would prove that they were not </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fixed. </span><span class="font9">The Scriptures do not distinguish between stars and meteors as is commonly done in our day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Shooting stars, and even meteoric showers are not uncommon every year, and some years more than others. It is computed that 400,000 small meteors fall to our earth annually. But these are nothing in comparison to the great shower of Nov. 13, 1833, in which millions on millions fell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We quote the following from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The American Cyclopedia, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vol. xi., page 431:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The year 1833 is memorable for the most magnificent display on record. This was on the night of Nov. 12, and was visible over all the United States and over a part of Mexico and the West India Islands. Together with the smaller shooting stars which fell like snowflakes and produced phosphorescent lines along their course, there were intermingled large fireballs, which darted forth at intervals, describing in a few seconds an arc of 30° or 40°. These left behind luminous trains, which remained in view several minutes, and sometimes half an hour or more. One of them, seen in North Carolina, appeared of larger size and greater brilliancy than the moon. Some of the luminous bodies were of irregular form, and remained stationary for a considerable time, emitting streams of light. At Niagara the exhibition was especially brilliant, and probably no spectacle so terribly grand and sublime was ever before beheld by man as that of the firmament descending in fiery torrents over the dark and roaring cataract. It was observed that the lines of all the meteors, if traced back, converged in one quarter of the heavens, which was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Leonis Majoris ;</span><span class="font9"> and this point accompanied the stars in their apparent</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">motion westward, instead of moving with the earth toward tne East. The source whence the meteors came was thus shown to be independent of tne earth’s relation, and exterior to our atmosphere.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Prof, von Humboldt devotes fifteen pages of his work, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Personal Narrative, </span><span class="font9">to this phenomenon; and declares that it was visible over an area of eleven million square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Symbolic Fulfilments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While these literal signs served their designed purpose in drawing general attention to the Time of the End, we believe that the symbolic fulfilments are no less striking and even more interesting to those whose mental and spiritual per-ceptives are awakened so as to enable them to appreciate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sun</span><span class="font9"> as a symbol represents </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">Gospel light, the Truth—and thus Christ Jesus. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">moon</span><span class="font9"> as a symbol represents the light of the Mosaic Law. As the moon is a reflection of the light of the sun, so the Law was the shadow or reflec</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">tion </span><span class="font9">beforehand of the Gospel. . The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">stars </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font9">symbols represent the inspired teachers of the Church—the Apostles. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">heavens,</span><span class="font9"> as already shown, represent the ecclesiastical powers of Christendom. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font9">combination of these symbols is found in Revelation (12:1), where the “woman,” symbolizing the early Church, is represented as clothed with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sun,</span><span class="font9"> that is, resplendent in the full, clear light of the unclouded Gospel. . The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">moon</span><span class="font9"> under her feet represents that the Law which supports her is nevertheless not the source </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">her light. The twelve stars about her head as a crown represent her divinely appointed and inspired teachers—the Twelve Apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Symbolic Sun Darkened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">True, there have been a few all along who, not understanding the Ransom, and unable to harmonize it with other truths, and especially with their errors, rejected </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">it. </span><span class="font9">These, however, were rare exceptions </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">the rule. But since 1878—the very point of trial-time indicated in the Scriptures—the parallel to the time of Christ’s rejection at the First Advent, when the Cross of Christ became to the Jew </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">stumbling block, the stumbling has made great progress, until today only </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">small minority of the professed ministers of the Cross </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">recognize</span><span class="font9"> its value or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">preach </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">it. On </span><span class="font9">the contrary, much of the teaching now aims to disclaim and disprove that we were </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“bought</span><span class="font9"> with a pride, even the precious Blood of Christ,” and substitutes for this the theory of Evolution, claiming that Christ’s value to the sinner consists tn His words and example </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">merely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus the sunlight of the Gospel is daily becoming more and more obscure; and although this denial of the value of the precioiis Blood as our redemption-price has not so generally extended from the pulpit to the pew, yet false doctrines long held sacred, together with reverence for leaders and learning, have made the way so easy that a large majority of all who get sufficiently awake to consider the subject fall an easy prey to this doctrine </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">Evolution, which denies the Scriptural doctrine of a primal fall and of a Ransom from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>w</sub> Symbolic Moon Turned to Blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As the sunlight of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Ransom</span><span class="font9"> becomes obscured, so the moonlight of the Mosaic Law, which in its sacrifices foreshadowed </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">Ransom, must </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">necessity become obscured also. It is no longer uncommon for public teachers to refer to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">bloody </span><span class="font9">sacrifices of Israel, required by their Law, as barbaric. Once, when they saw by the true Light of the Word of God, they appreciated the Apostle’s statement that Isarael’s sacrifices were foreshadowings of “better sacrifices” for sin; but now, refusing the antitype, the Ransom, and denying Original Sin, and all need therefore of sacrifices for it, the typical sacrifices are repudiated also and esteemed barbaric. Thus the darkening of the Gospel sunlight results in the darkening ©f the moonlight. “The moon shall be turned into </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">blood.”</span><span class="font9"> And Joel (2 :10) adds that “the stars shall withdraw their shining,” which signifies that when the Gospel light is obscured, and the Law comes to be regarded merely as a meaningless and barbaric ceremony of blood, then the teachings of the God-ordained Twelve Stars of the Church (the Apostles) will also fade from view, cease to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font9">recognized guides or lights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Symbolic Stars—-True and False.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font9">we have seen, God has recognized </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font9">appointed Twelve Apostolic Stars for </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">Church. From these and the “moon” and the “sun” all the enlightenment of the Church was to proceed. And from these the true Light, which has blessed </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">true Church, has proceeded. But Papacy, assuming ecclesiastical lordship </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">earth, has placed or “ordained” various stars, lights, “authorities,” “theologians,” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font9">her firmament; and the various Protestant denominations have done likewise, until the whole number is innumerable. But God, while providing helps, evangelists and teachers to His true Church has </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font9">ordained them with </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">authority of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">lights</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">stars.</span><span class="font9"> On the contrary, all of His faithful followers are instructed to accept as Light only those rays of Truth seen to proceed from the Sun and Moon and Twelve Stars </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">ordained for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All the others of God’s people are during this Age to be burning and shining lights, and are not to put their lamps under a bushel, but to so shine as to glorify their Father in Heaven. The word </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">star</span><span class="font9"> (Greek </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">aster)</span><span class="font9"> is not used respecting any of the faithful (outside the Apostles) in referring to them in this present life; but it is used with reference to those who depart from the Truth, and become “heady,” false teachers, “vainly puffed up,” aspiring to be considered </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">authorities </span><span class="font9">in the same sense as the Apostles, and who are styled “wandering stars,” “false apostles.”—2 Corinthians 11:13; Revelation 2:2; Jude 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now if God ordained only twelve stars as lights for His Church, as represented in Revelation (12:1), is it not a great mistake for popes and bishops to regard themselves as successors of the Apostles —stars also? And is it not a fact that certain of the so-called “higher critics” regard themselves and are regarded by others as the equals or indeed the superiors of the Apostles, as light-shiners, stars? And do not they and others show this, by preaching </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">their own ideas,</span><span class="font9"> shining out their own light on various subjects, without considering it necessary to consult or to give as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">proof</span><span class="font9"> the words of the inspired; Apostles? And if they quote or refer at all to the Light of the true stars, the Twelve Apostles’ teachings, is it not rather to have them </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">confirm their</span><span class="font9"> views or light, rather than to show that the teaching, is light from the Apostolic Stars? And indeed the light of these false stars, “wandering stars,” is usually so opposed to that of the inspired Twelve, that they can scarcely so much as find a suitable text from their writings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In our Lord’s prophecy these true starlights are reckoned in as part of the Gospel sunlight, darkened, withdrawn from shining; while the false . stars, the worldly-wise, man-ordained lights of the present heavens are represented as making a great display in coming down to earthly conditions:—abandoning their once somewhat spiritual eminence, and in their teachings coming down to' the level of earthly moralists and philosophers—to the Christian-citizenship-politics level..</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">shaking</span><span class="font9"> of the symbolic ecclesiastical heavens mentioned in the same connection has somewhat to do with, these lights of Christendom coining to a lower plane of public teaching. This </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">shaking </span><span class="font9">would signify just what we see on every hand—a shaking up of the creeds and dogmas of Christendom, which, because of their admixture of errors, produce confusion whenever referred to—for instance the doctrine of elect and non-elect infants ; the doctrine of the eternal torment of all who are not saints, overcomers, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a consequence, many of the worldly-wise men who are starring before the public are already making every effort to distract attention from all such subjects. What other subjects can they find than either the true or the false doctrine of election,, and the true or the false idea of God’s provision for the future life of mankind? Not knowing of the true, Divine Plan of the Ages, and not wishing to awaken controversy along the lines of hell and infant damnation, what can these “star” preachers preach, that will attract the attention of the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They can abandon spiritual themes entirely, and descend to the plane , of the natural man, to moral and political reform questions. They can go “slumming,” and preach the anti-slum gospel. They can join in Christian-citizenship Crusades, etc. And these things will more and more engage these pulpit stars; while others will create sensations by outdoing the most celebrated Infidels in statements of what, they do not believe ; in making sport of the Bible record of an Adamic fall into sin, and the idea of being saved out of something which is a myth, according to their Evolutionary theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Who cannot see these signs fulfilling on every hand today! But the Suu and Moon and Twelve Stars are only partly obscured as yet; nevertheless many of the false stars have fallen from every pretence of Gospel shining to the level of the comprehension of the masses to whom they preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Distress of Nations—Perplexity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Coincidently, Luke (21:25, 26) adds other signs of this time : “Upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity; the sea and the waves [the restless and lawless elements] roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming' on the earth [society] ; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The roaring sea and waves symbolize the restless masses of humanity, curbed, but not fully restrained, by the laws and regulations of society. Every one has heard some of this “roaring” for the past forty years, with occasional stormy outbreaks dashing like tidal-waves against the earth [social order] and seeking to swallow it up. Restrained for a time, these waves are gathering weight and force; and, as prophetically shown, it is only a question of a few years until all the mountains [kingdoms] are “removed and carried into the midst of the sea,” in anarchy. (Psalm 46:1, 2.) Every newspaper, not under the control of wealth, voices the roar of the restless “sea” class; and the others, though unwillingly, must give the echo of the roaring as matters of daily news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And it is as men begin to realize that the sea-roar and unrest are due largely </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">the wane of superstition and of ecclesiastical influence, and as they more and more see the powers of heaven [sectarian creeds and systems] shaken, that their hearts are failing them for fear—in apprehension of the things coming upon the earth [society] ; but the strenuous efforts now being made to re-establish and unify sectarian power and influence, will be </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font9">great measure successful only for a short time; for it will surely disintegrate completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Sign of the Son of Man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verse 30, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">first part.—“And then [at that same time] shall appear the sign [evidence, proof] of the Son of Man,” the proof or evidence of the Second Advent of the Son of Man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font9">should not lose sight of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the fact </span><span class="font9">that this entire prophecy is given in answer to certain questions, one of which ■was, “What shall be the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sign</span><span class="font9"> of Thy </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">presence”</span><span class="font9"> at the Second Advent? Having in mind the fact that few recognized the Messiah at His First Advent, and that they themselves had doubts and fears </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font9">the subject for a considerable time, they wished to know how they would be sure to recognize Him. At the First Advent our Lord showed Himself, and was attested by </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">signs—</span><span class="font9">by His wonderful words and works, and by John the Baptizer. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What sign</span><span class="font9"> should they expect to indicate His Second </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Presence?</span><span class="font9"> was their pointed question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our Lord’s answer assured them that His people would not be left without </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">suitable and sufficient </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sign;</span><span class="font9"> but of its character He said nothing. “Then shall appear the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sign</span><span class="font9"> of the Sen of Man.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font9">will be sufficient for the faithful, watchful people of God, but is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">not intended for others.</span><span class="font9"> It was this class that saw and understood the signs or proofs of His First Advent, while the masses of nominal. Israel </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">could not discern the </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">signs </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">of their times,</span><span class="font9"> and God did not wish that others should discern them; hence many </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the wonderful Words, of Life were spoken in parables and dark sayings, that iseeing they might not </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">see,</span><span class="font9"> and hearing they might not understand, being unworthy of the Light then due to the faithful only. And so it will be in respect to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sign</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">evidence</span><span class="font9"> of the Lord’s Second Presence.. It will not be manifested to all mankind; it can be recognized only by Israelites indeed, and they must be honest—without guile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■ The word siyn ( verse 30) is in the Greek </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">seemion</span><span class="font9"> and has the significance of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">proof</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">evidence</span><span class="font9"> as illustrated in the following cases:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“And many other </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">signs</span><span class="font9"> truly did Jesus.”—John 20:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The Lord . . . granted </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">signs</span><span class="font9"> and wonders to be done by their [Paul’s and Barnabas’] hands.”—Acts 14 :3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Tongues are for a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sign</span><span class="font9"> ... to them that believe not.”—1 Corinthians 14:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hence, “Ye shall see the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sign</span><span class="font9"> of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Sqn </span><span class="font9">of Man,” does not signify that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">Lord’s disciples then living will see </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Him, </span><span class="font9">but that they will have an indication </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font9">evidence of His </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Presence</span><span class="font9"> at that time. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">signs</span><span class="font9"> of our Lord’s Second Presence will be found in harmony with, and corroborated by, the testimony of the prophets, as was the case at the First Advent. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">—Luke 24:44, 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“In Heaven?'</span><span class="font9"> The sign or proof of His </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Parousia</span><span class="font9"> will be given </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in heaven.</span><span class="font9"> Not in the Heaven of the Father’s presence and before the holy angels, but in the symbolic heaven, the ecclesiastical heaven, the same heaven which the preceding verse tells us shall be so terribly shaken as to shake out its stars. It is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in this heaven—</span><span class="font9">the professedly spiritual class— that the sign or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">evidence of our Lord's presence</span><span class="font9"> will first be apparent. Some will “see” the fulfilment of the prophetic declarations respecting this Day of the Second Presence, in the marvelous unfolding of the Divine Plan of the Ages, and will recognize it as one of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">signs of His presence.</span><span class="font9"> (Luke 12:37.)- The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">judgment</span><span class="font9"> of Babylon, Christendom, social and ecclesiastical, is another sign that the Judge has come, and is reckoning first. of all with those to whom as stewards He committed His goods. (Matthew 25:19; Luke 19:15.) “Judgment must begin with the house of God”; and it means confusion and consternation among the Doctors and Chief Priests of the present time, as they attempt to reconcile their doctrines, practises and faiths, as it did to the Pharisees and Priests and Doctors of the Law at our Lord’s first presence—even though the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">presence was denied</span><span class="font9"> then, as now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">But at the First Presence the humble Israelites indeed, whom God accounted worthy, were not confused, but enlightened, so that our Lord could say to them, “Blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear; for verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.”—Matt. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">13:17.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verse 30, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">second part.—“Then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">. The tribes of earth will not see </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sign</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">proof</span><span class="font9"> of the Lord’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">presence</span><span class="font9"> given only among the “heavens,” the at least nominally spiritual—the churches—and appreciated only by the guileless of these.. Nor will they ever see the Lord Himself by natural sight, for He is no longer </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">flesh</span><span class="font9"> and to be seen of the fleshly. Our Lord’s words should be remembered— “Yet a little while and the world </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">seeth Me no more.”</span><span class="font9"> (John 14:19.) And the Apostle’s words to the Church are also to be kept in memory—that we all must be “changed,” and made spirit beings like our Lord, before we can </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“see Him as He is.”</span><span class="font9"> (1 Corinthians 15:51-53; J John 3:2.) . The tribes of earth, on th© contrary, will see the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">clouds of trouble </span><span class="font9">and confusion incident to the shaking </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the “heavens,”. and realize it to be a storm which will shake the “earth” also (See Hebrews 12:26, 27), and at that time also there shall be a general mourning of all, incident to that great Time of Trouble; and eventually all mankind at the close of the storm shall </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">discern,</span><span class="font9"> recognize the new King with the eyes </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">their understanding and shall mourn for Him, and that they ever in blindness rejected Him—the Jew first.—See Zechariah 12 :10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The “Great Trumpet’’ Shall Sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verse 31.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“And He shall send His angels with a great trumpet and He shall gather His Elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.” (Sinaitic MS. omits “sound.”)-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This work will be in progress </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font9">interim, the Harvest. The angels (messengers of the new King of earth) will </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">do a </span><span class="font9">separating work, not between </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">Church and the. world, but a separating work in the nominal church—among nominal professors, the present “heavens.” This work is represented under various symbolic descriptions; it is the gathering of the wheat from the.tares into the barn (Matthew 13:30) ; it is the gathering </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the good fish into baskets and the casting of the unsuitable fish caught in the Gospel net back into the sea (Matthew 13: 47-49) ; it is the gathering of His jewels (Malachi 3 :17) ; it is the calling of “My people” . out of Babylon (Revelation 18:4) ; it is the midnight cry to the virgins., which separates the wise from ths foolish (Matthew 25:6); and in this prophecy it is the gathering of “the Elect” from all the non-elect, from </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">four winds—from every quarter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font9">are not to expect spirit-angels </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">appear with wings and to fly through </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">air blowing a great trumpet, and' here and there catching away some </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font9">saints; no more than we are to expect </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">become literal fish and to be put into literal baskets, or literal grains of wheat to be put into a literal barn.

<p><span class="font9">symbolize human creeds which are long enough for “babes” in Christ, but too short for a developed “man” to stretch bimself in it. This is true of the various “doctrines of men,” substituted for but very different from the doctrines of God’s Word, whose lengths and breadths surpass human knowledge. For instance, the doctrine of Election, as taught by our Calvinist friends, is a quite sufficient “bed” to rest many who are only “babes” in Christ, whose senses have never been much exercised;<sup>1</sup> but as in the light of present day knowledge the babes get awake and grow in grace and knowledge, they will all surely find the old creedbed too short for comfort; and as each attempts to Wrap himself in the promises of God- narrowed by an erroneous theology, he cannot satisfactorily cover bimself; doubts creep in to chill him with fear that after all he is not certain that he and all his friends are of the Elect; and by and by such developed Christians find it a relief to get out of such a predicament. Others, however, the vast majority, remain quite satisfied and comfortable in their various little cribs, because they are “babes” and not “men” in Christian knowledge and experience. “Qne shall be taken and the other left.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verse 40.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The field is the world,” our Lord explained ; and in this discourse it represents a condition outside the nominal “house”—outside of Babylon. Thus we are taught that not all “come-outers” will be “gathered,” but that the “jewels” will be sought wherever they may be— “the Lord knoweth them that are His,” and in this Harvest gathering He is making up His Jewels—gathering His Elect, to be joint-heirs in His Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verse 41.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Two shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken and the other left.&quot;—See Luke 11.'35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A mill is a, place where food is prepared ; the ministers and theological schools do the grinding of the spiritual food for “Babylon,” and turn out very pour grist—not “clean provender.” The complaint is a growing one that the food supplied is largely husks and chaff, which will not sustain spiritual life and strength; and each grinder is obliged to prepare what is given him by his own denomination, and he cannot hold his position and yet provide the “meat in due season,” “clean provender,” for the household of faith. Hence “Present Truth” gathers some of the grinders and leaves others—one is taken and another left. Those who are loyal to God and to His flock will be taken; all others will be left. While the world and the nominal church declare this to be a time of union and “confederacy,” God declares it to be a time of separating.—Isa. 8 :12. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Whither Gathered?—The Attraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“And they [the disciples] answered and jsaid unto Him, Where, Lord? [Where will these be </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">taken?] </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">And He said unto them, Wheresoever the body [the carcass, the food] is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.”—Matthew 24:28; Luke 11:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The lesson is that- </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in that day,</span><span class="font9"> when the Lord is gathering His Elect from the four winds of Heaven—from every quarter of the Church—He will attract them as eagles are attracted, by spiritual food, for which they have a keenness of vision and appetite; that in due time the Lord would provide the proper food, and His true people would recognize it and be gathered to it—the ready and worthy taken and the others left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Watch, if Ye Would Know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verses 42, 43.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Watch therefore: for ye know pot what hour your Lord doth come. But understand this [the reason why the time is so secreted under sym-bols and parables], that if the householder had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The “master of the house” or “householder” of the present dispensation is not </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font9"> Lord, but </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font9"> Adversary, the Devil —“the god of this world,” the “Prince of the power of the air,” “the Prince of this world,” who now ruleth in the children of disobedience, blinding the minds of all that believe not—whose eyes of understanding have not been anointed with the Lord’s eye-salve. (2 Corinthians 4 :4; Ephesians 2:2 ; Revelation 3 :18.) This Adversary is a wily one and very cunning; and whatever knowledge he has of the Divine times and seasons and arrangements he is prompt to use in opposing the Divine Plan, as our Lord declares in the foregoing statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Heavenly Father’s course toward Satan has been to let him take his own way, except where it would conflict with the Divine Plan, and so to overrule his evil devices as to use them for the furtherance of the Divine Plan. Hence Satan, although he has long known the Bible, has understood but little of it, for the same reason that man has not understood it; because written in parables, symbols and figures of speech. And now that these are </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">due</span><span class="font9"> to be understood, the</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The “great trumpet” we understand to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font9">the antitypical “Trumpet of Jubilee,” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">“Seventh Trumpet,” as symbolic as </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">preceding six (Revelation 11:15-18), </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">none </span><span class="font9">of which ever made any literal </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">sound. It </span><span class="font9">has been symbolically sound</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font9">since October, 1874, and will con</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">tinue to the </span><span class="font9">end </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the Millennium. With </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">beginning of this Trumpet began the Harvest and the reaping and separating, which must continue until “the Elect,” the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“wheat,” are </span><span class="font9">all gathered out of the pres</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ent </span><span class="font9">heavens (ecclesiastical systems) unto </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">Lord. The “angels” (messengers) </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font9">those who carry the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Message</span><span class="font9"> ofWthe </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord’s </span><span class="font9">Word which produces the separa</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">tion </span><span class="font9">and gathers His Elect to Himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font9">is the privilege of the faithful people </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">God who are now translated out of darkness into the marvelous light—who </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font9">permitted to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">see</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">hear</span><span class="font9"> those things </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font9">others do not see and hear, to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font9">co-workers with their Lord as His angels —messengers or servants—in this as well </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">as in </span><span class="font9">all the other features of the work, throughout the Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Proximity of the Kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verses 32-35.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Now learn a parable </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the fig tree: When his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">summer is nigh; so likewise ye, when </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ye </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">shall see all these things, know that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(the Kingdom of God—Luke 11:21) </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">near, even at the doors. Verily I say </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tinto </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">you, This generation shall not pass </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">till </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all these things be fulfilled.&quot; “Heaven </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">earth [the present ecclesiastical and social order] shall pass away; but My &quot;Word shall not pass away&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Unbelievers have seized upon this pas</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">sage </span><span class="font9">claiming that it manifestly has not </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font9">fulfilled, and hence proves our Lord </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">have been a false prophet. They apply </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">prophecy wholly to the troubles con</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">nected </span><span class="font9">with the fall of Israel’s national polity in A. D. 70, and contemptuously remark that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">that generation</span><span class="font9"> and many more passed away without seeing the fulfilment of “all these things.” Our answer </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">this, of course, is that our Lord’s prophecy is not understood—that it referred only in part to the trouble upon Israel which culminated in A. D. 70.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But understanding </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">genea</span><span class="font9"> here, as elsewhere, to mean </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">generation,</span><span class="font9"> and recognizing that our Lord’s words were a prophecy covering the entire Gospel Age, we have no difficulty in understanding </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">statement to mean, “This generation [which will witness the signs inquired </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font9">by the Apostles and just enumerated by our Lord—-namely, the darkening of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">sun and moon and the falling of the stars]—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">this generation</span><span class="font9"> shall not pass </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">away </span><span class="font9">until all these things be fulfilled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font9">“generation” might be reckoned as equivalent to at centhry (practically the present limit) or one hundred and twenty years, Moses’ lifetime and the Scripture limit. (Genesis 6:3.) Reckoning a hundred years from 1780, the date of the first sign, the limit would reach to 1880; and, to our understanding, every item predicted had begun to be fulfilled at that date—the Harvest or gathering time beginning October 1874; the organization of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">Kingdom and the taking by our Lord </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">His great power as the King in April, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">1878, </span><span class="font9">and the Time of Trouble or “day of wrath,” which began October, 1874, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font9">the sprouting of the fig tree—the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font9">viving of the Jewish nation through Zionism. Those who choose might with</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font9">inconsistency say that the century </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font9">generation might as properly reckon from the last sign, the falling of the stars, as from the first, the darkening of the sun and moon; and a century beginning 1833 would be still far from run out. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">*‘Day and Hour No Man Knoweth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verse 36, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sinaitie MS.—“But of that day and hour knoweth no man; no not the angels of Heaven, nor the Son, but My Father only.&quot; (Compare Mark 13:32, 33.) “Take ye heed, watch and pray, for ye know not when the time is.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To many these words seem to imply much more than they express; they think </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">them as though they put a lock upon and made useless all the prophecies of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">Bible—as though our Lord had said, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“No </span><span class="font9">man shall </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">ever</span><span class="font9"> know, whereas </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font9">merely said, “No man </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[now]</span><span class="font9"> knoweth,” referring only to the persons who heard Him—to whom the exact times and season^ were not due to be revealed. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Who can </span><span class="font9">doubt that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">“angels </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">Heaven” and “the Son” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">now know,</span><span class="font9"> fully and clearly, matters which have progressed so nearly to fulfilment? And </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font9">they are not </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font9"> hindered from know</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font9">by the statement of this verse, neither </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">now.</span><span class="font9"> are God’s saints hindered or restrained by this verse from seeking an understanding of all Truth which has been “written aforetime for our learning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God, through His Prophet Daniel, pointed out that at </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font9"> time “the wise </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">shall </span><span class="font9">understand” the vision and prophecy, and merely that “none of the wicked shall understand.” (Daniel 12 :9,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">10.) To this the Apostle Paul adds his testimony, “Ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should come upon you as a thief,” although it shall come thus upon all the world. “Watch ye, therefore [that in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">due time </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ye-may know], and pray always that ye may be . accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">As in the Days of Noah, “They Knew Not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verses 37-39.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the presence [Greek parousia] of the Son of Man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and . drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and ' knew not, ... so shall also the presence of the Son of Man be.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The real point of this illustration is overlooked by many who presuppose, without any authority in the Master’s words, that the similarity here being pointed out is the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">wickedness</span><span class="font9"> of Noah’s day and that of the day of Christ’s presence. But while such a comparison might have been justifiable and proper, the fact remains that such comparison was not made, but avoided. The comparison made is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">similarity of ignorance.</span><span class="font9"> Only Noah and his family </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">knew;</span><span class="font9"> the people knew NOT, but proceeded as usual—marrying, planting, building, eating and drinking. Similarly, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">during the time. of Christ’s presence</span><span class="font9"> in the end of this Age, and while the great Time of Trouble is impending, the only ones who will know of His </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">presence</span><span class="font9"> or have a clear apprehension of what is coming, or why, or the outcome, will be the Lord’s people. Others will </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“know not.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Luke (17 :26-29) the same lesson is taught; and both Noah’s and Lot’s neighbors are shown to have been </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">ignorant</span><span class="font9"> of their impending troubles </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in the days</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> of </span><span class="font9">Noah, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in the days</span><span class="font9"> of Lot, as people here will be ignorant of the coming trouble </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in the days of the Son of Man— </span><span class="font9">after He has come and is present. We see this clearly fulfilled about us today. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font9">world is fearful and perplexed; but it knows not of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">presence</span><span class="font9"> of the Son </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">Man, and the Harvest reckoning now in progress. Even though they may approximately surmise the trouble coming, they cannot guess the blessing beyond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Even thus shall it be when the Son </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">Man [already </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">present]</span><span class="font9"> is revealed ■ [made manifest—first to His vzatching “virgins,” later in the trouble to all men]. In that day, he which shall be on the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away; and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back. Remember Lot’s wife! Whosoever shall seek to save his life [by compromises of conscience and staying in Babylon] shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life [sacrifice the interests of the present life] shall preserve it”— everlastingly.—Luke 17 :30-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus does Luke’s Gospel apply these words (already considered foregoing) to the close of the Gospel Age—“the Day when the Son of Man is revealed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Remember Lot’s wife!&quot;</span><span class="font9"> is our Lord’s pointed warning. How slight would be the appropriateness of this injunction, if applied to those who fled from Judea in A. D. 70; but how intensely forceful jt is as a caution to God’s people here, in the close of the Gospel Age! When we learn that Babylon is doomed, and hear the Lord’s Message, “Come out of her My people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues,” it is indeed like the voice of the messengers who hastened Lot and his family out of Sodom, saying, “Stay not in all the plain; escape for thy life; escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed ; look not behind thee I”—Genesis 19:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The illustration is heightened when we remember that Christendom is “that great city [Babylon] which Scripturally is called Sodom.”—Revelation 11:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lot’s wife, after starting to flee as directed, “looked back”; coveting the things behind; and so with some now fleeing from Babylon to the mountain (Kingdom) of the Lord; they are more in sympathy with the things behind than with the things before. Only those will run the race to the 'finish who set their affections on the things above, and not on the things beneath. The perseverance </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the saints springs from </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">full consecration of heart; all others will fail </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font9">to run as to obtain the great prize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">One Taken and Another Left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“I tell you that in that night there shall be two in one bed; the one shall be taken and the other shall be left’’—■ Luke 11:34—omitted by Matthew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Lend, through the Prophet, informs us that though the Millennial morning draws near, a night also approaches. (Isaiah 21:12.) It will be a night of trouble in the forepart of which the saints will be gathered out of Babylon. The “bed” here, in harmony with Isaiah’s use of that word (Isaiah 28:20), may be interpreted to understanding of them is confined to such as have the guidance of the Holy Spirit, which, as our Lord promised, “shall guide </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font9"> into all Truth,” but which the world cannot receive. Satan does not possess the Holy Spirit and is not guided by it, and consequently much of the Divine Word is foolishness unto him. But he has learned, no doubt as the world to some extent has learned, that “The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him.” (Psalm 25:14.) We may presume therefore that his representatives, the fallen angels, are frequently present at the little Conferences and Bible studies, etc., of God’s truly consecrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In what way Satan would have managed his affairs differently if he had known sooner more about the Divine Plan, we can only surmise; but we have our Lord’s positive testimony that such knowledge on Satan’s part would have made necessary a different ending of the Gospel Age, and a different opening of the ' Millennial Age, than God had purposed and declared. But instead of knowing and setting his house in order, he was taken unawares by . the Lord’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">parousia </span><span class="font9">in 1874, and the Harvest work then begun ; so that with all his wiles and de-, ceptions, all his simulations of the true Light, etc., his “house,” present institutions, wiM suffer complete collapse. As he realizes this, he puts forth the most strenuous efforts to deceive—even resorting through his deluded servants to miracles of physical healing, although he is the Prince of disease, sickness and death. (Hebrews 2:14.) But a house thus divided against itself is sure to fall; and great will be the fall of Babylon; it will fall as a great millstone cast into the sea.—Revelation 18 :21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verse 44.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Therefore be ye also ready, for at such an hour as ye think not the Son of Man cometh.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“ye also,”</span><span class="font9"> believers, the Lord’s faithful, are mentioned in contrast with Satan and his household. The time of the Lord’s Presence could not be known beforehand, even by the saints. Nor was the fact of the Lord’s Presence recognized until nearly a year after October, 1874, when His knock, through the Word of the Prophets and Apostles, was recognized. Since that time there are abundant outward signs, evidences, of the presence of the Son of Man; and His devoted ones as they are gathered from the four winds of heaven, are taken into His banquetingzhouse and caused to sit down to meat such as the world knoweth not of, and are served, first of all by the Master Himself, and incidentally by each other.—See Luke 12:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">* * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The careful readers of Bible Students Monthly will undoubtedly concur with the Editor in appreciation of the foregoing exposition by Pastor Russell of the Lord’s Great Prophecy of Matthew 24. We trust that everyone who reads it ■will do so with Bible in hand, that the masterly applications may be the better understood and enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are yet seven verses in this 24th chapter of Matthew (45-51) remaining to be considered:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Verses 45-51.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Who then is the faiths ful and prudent servant, whom His Master has placed over His household to give them food in due season. Happy that servant whom His Master, on coming, shall find thus employed! Indeed I say to you that He will appoint him over all His stores of provisions.”—See also Luke 12:42-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The intimation' here seems to be that, at the particular time indicated by the prophecy—namely, during the Lord’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">presence,</span><span class="font9"> and at the time of the gathering of the Elect—our Lord, the great Servant of His people, will make choice of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">one channel</span><span class="font9"> for dispensing the meat in due season, though other channels or “fellow-servants” will be used in bringing the food to the “household.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Faithfulness on the part of said steward (both to the “Master” and to “his fellow-servants” and “the household”), will be rewarded by his. continuance as steward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To our understanding this would not imply that “that servant” or steward, used as a channel for the circulation of the “meat in due season,” would be the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">originator</span><span class="font9"> of that meat, nor </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">inspired,</span><span class="font9"> nor </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">infallible.</span><span class="font9"> Quite to the contrary, we may be sure that whoever the Lord would so use, as a Truth-distributing agent, will be very humble and unassuming, as well as very zealous for the Master’s glory; so that he would not think of claiming authorship or ownership of the Truth, but would merely dispense it zealously, as his Master’s gift, to his Master’s “servants” and “household.”</span></p>

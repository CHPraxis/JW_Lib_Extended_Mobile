<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">'‘ He spared not their souls from death. ”—Psalm 78:50.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">O.OME one will possibly say, Ah! jgrv No one believes in the immor-tality of the body. Everybody knows that the body dies, that it needs resupply continually and that hence it cannot be immortal. But the Scriptures speak of souls. May it not be that the soul is indestructible?—that God having made a soul cannot destroy it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Reason tells us that, unless there is absolute proof to the contrary, the life of every creature is subject to the will of the Creator. Now notice that the Scriptures nowhere speak of the immortality of the soul, as some people seem to suppose—neither in the translations nor in the original text. Take a Concordance and try to find the expression “immortal soul,” and thus you can quickly convince yourself that no such expression is found in the Scriptures. On the contrary, the Scriptures declare that “God is able to destroy both soul and body;” and again, “the soul that sinneth, it shall die.” As we have already seen, that which can die, which can be destroyed, is not immortal, is not proof against death, destruction. Hence the Scriptures cited prove that neither souls nor bodies are immortal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What, then, is the soul?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The general idea of-the-soul -te—ths^t-it is an indefinable something in us, but what it is or where it is located few attempt to explain. This unknown something is claimed to be the real, intelligent being, while the body is merely its house or tool. A Methodist bishop once defined a soul, thus: “It is without interior or exterior, without body, shape, or parts, and you could put a million of them into a nutshell;’’ —a very good definition of nothing, we should say!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God Able to Destroy Both Soul and Body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The body is not the soul, as some affirm; this is proved by our Lord’s statement that “God is able to destroy both soul and body.” And now, in view of the foregoing, if our minds be freed from prejudice, we ought to be able to learn something further on this subject by examining the inspired record of man’s creation. Turning to Genesis 2:7, we read: —</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed [Heb. blew] into his nostrils the breath [Heb. wind] of life [Heb. lives plural—i. e., such as was common to all living animals]; and man became a living-soul” [i. e., a sentient being].</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From this account it appears that the body was formed first, but it was not a man, soul or being, until animated. It had eyes, but saw nothing; ears, but heard nothing; a mouth, but spoke nothing; a tongue, but no taste; nostrils, but no sense of smell; a heart, but it pulsated nbt; blood, but it was cold, lifeless; lungs, but they moved not. It was not a man, but a corpse, an inanimate body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The second step in the process of man’s creation was to give vitality to the properly “formed” and in every way prepared body; and this, is described by the words “blew into his nostrils the breath of life.” When a healthy person has been drowned, and animation is wholly suspended, resuscitation has, it is said, been effected by working the arms and thus the lungs as a bellows, and so gradually establishing the breath in the nostrils. In Adam’s case it of course required no labored effort on the part of the Creator to cause the - perfect organism which he had made to breathe the lifegiving oxygen of the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As the vitalizing breath entered, the lungs expanded, the blood corpuscles wer.e oxygenized and passed to the heart, which organ in turn propelled them, to every part of the body, awakening all the prepared, but hitherto dormant, nerves to sensation and energy In an instant the energy reached the' brain, and thought, perception, reasoning, looking, touching, smelling, by the cultivation of the lower organs of thought and a failure to use the higher,_ intellectual faculties, have dwarfe'd the organs of the brain representing these higher faculties, yet the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">organs </span><span class="font8">are still there, and are capable </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">development, which is not the case with the most nearly perfect specimens of the brute creation. So then it is in that the Creator has endowed man with a higher and finer organism, that he has made him to differ from the brute. They have similar flesh and bones, breathe the same air, drink the same water, and eat similar food, and all are souls or creatures possessing intelligence; but man, in his better body, possesses capacity for higher intelligence and is treated by the Creator as on ari entirely different plane. It is in proportion as sin degrades man from his original likeness of his Creator that he is said to be “brutish”— more nearly resembling the brutes, destitute of the higher and finer sensibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To this the Scripture testimony agrees. We read (Gen. 1:30), “To you it shall be for meat, and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life [Heb. ‘nephesh &nbsp;chaiyah’—a &nbsp;living</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">soul].”—Again (Gen. 1:20), “Let the waters bring forth the moving creature that hath life [Heb.—a living soul].”— See marginal readings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Scripture Teaching on This.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The same lesson,—that the life prin-jnple is no what it is in all other creatures whose breath is taken through the nostrils, as distinguishing them from fish,—is taught in the account of the destruction wrought by the Deluge. (Gen. 6:17; 7:15, 22.) This is in full accord with King Solomon’s statement that man and beast have all “one breath” [Heb. ruach, spirit of life]—one kind of life; and that “as the one dieth, so dieth the other.” (Eccl. 3:19.) When he asks (Eccl. 3:21), “Who knoweth the spirit of man that [it] goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that [it] goeth downward to the earth?” he is controverting the heathen theory, which even- at that time had begun to speculate that man had some inherent quality which would prevent his death, even when he seemed to die. The wise man challenges any proof, any knowledge, to such effect. This challenge to others to produce proofs, or admit that they have no such knowledge, follows his statement of the truth on the subject in verses 19 and 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The distinction between man and beast is not in the kind of breath or life, but in that man has a higher organism than other animals; possessing moral and intellectual powers and qualities in the image or likeness of those possessed by the Creator, who has a still higher organism, of spirit, not of flesh. And, as already shown, man’s hope for a future life lies not in his inherent powers, but in his Creator’s gracious provision which centered in the redemption of every soul of man from death, by the great Redeemer, and the consequent provision that whosoever will may have everlasting life, by resurrection, subject to the terms of the New Covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our Redeemer “poured out his soul [being] unto death,” “he made his soul [being] an offering for sin” (Isa. 53:10, 12); and it was the soul of Adam (and his posterity) that he thus bought with his precious blood—by making his soul (being) an ‘Offering for sin. Consequently it is souls that were redeemed, and that are to be awakened, resurrected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many suppose that the bodies buried are to be restored atom for atom, but, on the contrary, the Apostle declares, “Thou sowest [in death] not that body which shall be.” In the resurrection God will give to each person (to each soul or sentient being) such a body as his infinite wisdom has been pleased to provide; to the Church, the “Bride” selected in this age, spirit bodies; to the restitution clas#, human bodies,, but not the same ones lost in death.—1 Cor. 15:37, 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As in Adam’s creation, the bringing together of an organism and the breath of life produced a sentient being or soul,’ so the dissolution of these, from any cause, puts an end to sentient being,—stopping thoughts and feelings of_ every kind. The soul (i. e., sentient being) ceases; the body returns to dust as it was; while the spirit or breath of life returns to God, who imparted it to Adam, and to his race through him.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">feeling and tasting commenced. That which was a lifeless human organism had become a man, a sentient being; the “living soul” condition mentioned in the text had been reached. In other words, the term “living soul” means neither more nor less than the term “sentinent being”; i. e., a being capable of sensation, perception, thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Moreover, even though Adam was perfect in his organism, it was necessary for him to sustain life, soul or sentient being, by partaking of the fruits of the trees of life. And when he sinned, God drove him from the garden, “lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree [plural trees or grove] of life, and eat, and live forever” [i. e., by eating continuously]. (Gen. 3:22.) How the fogs and mysteries scatter before the light of truth which shines from God’s Word!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lower Animals Also are Souls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus, also, we see why it is that the Scriptures speak of “souls” in connection with the lower animals. They, as well as man, are sentient beings or creatures of intelligence, only of lower orders. They, as well as man, can see, hear, feel, taste and smell; and each can reason up to the standard of his own organism, though none can reason as ab</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">struse</span><span class="font8">ly nor </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">on a</span><span class="font8">s high a plane as ’man. &quot;‘’This difference Is not' because man has a different kind of life from that possessed by the lower animals; for all have similar vital forces, from the same fountain or source of life, the same Creator; all sustain life in the same manner, by the digestion of similar foods, producing blood, and muscles, and bones, etc., each according to his kind or nature; and each propagates his species similarly, bestowing the life, originally from God, upon his posterity. They differ in shape and in mental capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nor can it be said that while man is a soul (or intelligent being) beasts are without this soul-quality or intelligence, thought, feeling. On the contrary, both man and beast have soul-quality.or intelligent, conscious being. Not only is this the statement of Scripture, but it is readily discernible as a fact, as soon as the real meaning of the word soul is comprehended, as shown foregoing. To illustrate: Suppose the creation of a perfect dog; and suppose that creation had been particularly described, as was Adam’s, what difference of detail could be imagined? The body of a dog created would not be a dog until the breath of life would be caused to energize that body;—then it would be a living creature with sensibilities and powers all its own—a living soul of the lower order, called dog, as Adam, when he received life, became a living creature with sensibilities and powers all his own—a living soul of the highest order of flesh beings, called man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Man’s Finer Organism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the great difference between man and beast is not in the life which animates both, and not from lack of soulpower which both possess, can it be that the difference is in their bodies? Yes; assuredly, the natural difference is physical, in addition to which is the fact that God has made provision for man’s future, as expressed in his promises, while no such provision for a future life is made for beasts—nor are they organically capable of appreciating metaphysics. Other things being equal, the size and weight of the brain indicates capacity and intelligence. In this respect man has been more highly endowed than the brute, by the Creator. The brute has less brains than man, and what it has belongs almost exclusively to the selfish propensities. Its highest conception of right and wrong is the will of its master, man; it cannot appreciate the sublime in morals or in nature; the Creator did not give it a brain-capacity for such things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But although, because of his fall into sin and death, man’s condition is far from what it was in its original perfection when pronounced “very good” by the highest Judge;—so that some,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">(Eccl. 12:7.) It returns to God in the sense that it is no longer amenable to-human control, as in pro-creation, and can never be recovered except by divine power. Recognizing this fact, the Lord’s instructed ones commit their hope of future life by resurrection to-God and to Christ, his now exalted representative. (Luke 23:46; Acts 7:59.&gt; So, then, had God made no provision for man’s future life by a ransom and a promised resurrection, death would have been the end of all hope for humanity.—1 Cor. 15:14-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Provision for Our Living Again..</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But God has thus made provision for our living again; and ever since he made known his gracious plan, those who speak and write intelligently upon the subject (for instance the inspired Scripture writers), as if by common consent, speak of the unconscious interim between death and the resurrection morning, in which sentient being is suspended, as a “sleep.” Indeed, the illustration is an excellent one; for the dead will be totally unconscious of the lapse of time, and the moment of awakening will seem to them like the next moment after the moment of their dissolution. For instance, we read that speaking of Lazarus’ death our Lord said, “Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, I •g^-that l-snay awake him out of sleep.” Afterward, because the disciples were slow to comprehend, he said, “Lazarus is dead.” (John 11:11.) Were the theory of consciousness in death correct, is it not remarkable that Lazarus gave no account of his experience during those four days? None will claim that he was in a “hell” of torment, for our Lord calls him his “friend”; and if he had been in heavenly bliss our Lord would not have called him from it, for that would have been an unfriendly act. But as our Lord expressed it, Lazarus slept, and he awakened him to life, to consciousness, to his sentient being, or soul returned or revived; and all this was evidently a favor greatly appreciated by Lazarus and his friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The thought pervades the Scriptures that we are now in the night of dying-and sleeping as compared with the morning of awakening and resurrection. “Weeping may endure for a night, buy joy cometh in the morning.”—Psa. 30:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The apostles also frequently used this appropriate, hopeful and peaceful figure of speech. For instance, Luke says of Stephen, the first martyr, “he fell asleep”; and in recording Paul’s speech at Antioch he used the same expression, “David fell on sleep.” (Acts 7:60; 13:36.) Peter uses the same expression, saying, “The fathers fell asleep.” (2 Pet. 3:4). And Paul used it many times, as the following quotations show:— &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.”— 1 Cor. 15:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“If there be no resurrection, . . . then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.”—1 Cor. 15: 13-18.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font8">“Christ is risen from the dead and become the first-fruits of them that slept.&quot;—1 Cor. 15:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Behold, I show you a mystery, we shall not all sleep.”—1 Cor. 15:51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleep.&quot;—1 Thess. 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Them that sleep in Jesus, will God bring [from the dead] with [by] him.&quot; •—1 Thess. 4:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the Kingdom, the resurrection time, comes, “we who are alive and remain unto the presence of the Lord shall not precede them that are asleep.” —1 Thess. 4:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They “fell asleep&quot; in peace, to await the Lord’s Day—the Day of Christ, the Millennial Day—fully persuaded that he [Christ] is able to keep that which they committed unto him against that day. (2 Tim. 1:12.) This same thought runs through the Old Testament as well—from the time that God first preached to Abraham the Gospel of a resurrection; the expression, “He slept with his fathers,” is very common in the Old Testament. But Job puts the matter in very forcible language, saying, “Oh that thou wouldst hide me in the grave, that thou wouldst keep me secret until thy wrath be [over] past!” The present dying time is the time of God’s wrath—the curse of death being upon all, because of the original transgression. However, we are promised that in due time the curse will be lifted and a blessing will come through the Redeemer to all the families of the earth; and so Job continues. “All the days of my appointed time will I wait, until my change come; [then] thou shalt call (John 5:25) and I will answer thee; thou shalt have a desire unto the work of thine hands.” (Job 14:14, 15.) And we of the Now Testament times read our Lord’s response, “All that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of man” [calling them to awake and come to a full knowledge of God and to a full opportunity of everlasting life].—John 5:25, 29..</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An Illustration—A Candle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let us illustrate the human and animal body, soul and spirit by something less complex and better understood generally; for instance,—an unlighted candle would correspond to an inanimate human body or corpse, the lighting of the candle would correspond to the spark of life originally imparted by the Creator; the flame or light corresponds to sentient being or intelligence or soul quality; the oxygenized atmosphere which unites with the carbon of the candle in supporting the flame corresponds to the breath of life or spirit of life which unites with the physical organism in producing soul or intelligent existence. If an accident should occur which would destroy the candle, the flame, of course, would cease; so if a human or animal body be destroyed, as by consumption or accident, the soul, the life, the intelligence, ceases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Or if the supply of air were cut off from the candle-flame, as by an extinguisher or snuffer, or by submerging the candle in water, the light would be extinguished even though the candle remained unimpaired. So the soul, life, existence, of man or animal would cease if the breath of life were cut off by drowning or asphyxiation, while the body might be comparatively sound. As the lighted candle might be used under favorable conditions to light other candles, but the flame, once extinguished, the candle could neither relight itself nor other candles, so the human or animal body while alive, as a living soul or being can, under divine arrangement, start or propagate other souls or beings—offspring; but so soon as the spark of life is gone, soul or being has ceased, and all power to think, feel or propagate has ceased. In harmony with this we read in the Scriptures of Jacob’s children: “All the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls.” (Exod. 1:5.)</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Luke</span><span class="font8"> 23:43.—This greatly misunderstood text explained in the August number of </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bible Students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Send post-card for free sample.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">Jacob received his spark of life as well as his physical organism, and hence the united product of these, his soul or intelligent being, from Isaac, and thence from Adam, to whom alone God ever directly imparted life. And Jacob passed on the life and organism and soul to his posterity; and so with all humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A candle might be relighted by any one having the ability; but by divine arrangement the human body, bereft of the spark of life, “wasteth away,” “returneth to the dust from which it was taken,” and the spark of life cannot be re-enkindled except by divine power, a. miracle. The promise of resurrection is therefore a promise of a relighting, a re-enkindling of animal existence or soul; and since there can be no being or soul without a body and restored life-power or spirit, it follows that a promised resurrection or restoration of soul or being implies new bodies, new organisms. Thus the Scriptures assure us that human bodies which return to dust will not be restored, but that in the resurrection God will give such new bodies as it mav please him to give.—1 Cor. 15:37-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Apostle here declares that in the resurrection there will be a special class accounted worthy of a new nature, spiritual instead of human or fleshly; and, as we should expect, he shows that this great change of nature will be effected by giving these a different kind of body. The candle may here again serve to illustrate: Suppose the fleshly or human nature to be illustrated by a tallow candle, the new body might be illustrated by a wax candle of a brighter flame or indeed by an electric arc-light apparatus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With any power and wisdom less</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font8">than that of our Creator guaranteeing the resurrection, we might justly fear some break or slip by which the identity would be lost, especially with those granted the great change of nature by a share in the first (chief) resurrection to spirit being. But we can securely trust this and all things to him with whom we have to do in this matter. He who knows our very thoughts can reproduce them in the new brains so that not one valuable lesson or precious experience shall be lost. He is too wise to err and too good to be unkind; and all that he has promised he will fulfill in a manner exceedingly abundantly better than we can ask or think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The terms body, soul and spirit may be used of the Church collectively. For instance, the Apostle says: “I pray God [that] your whole spirit, soul and body be preserved blameless, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thess. 5:23.) This prayer must be understood to apply to the Church as a whole—the elect church, whose names are written in heaven. The true spirit has been preserved in the little flock. Its body is discernible to-day, also, notwithstanding the multitudes of tares that would hide as well as choke it. And its soul, its activity, its intelligence, its sentient being, is in evidence everywhere, lifting up the standard of the people—the cross, the ransom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In no other way could we apply the Apostle’s words; for, however much people may differ respecting the preservation of the individual spirits and souls of the people addressed, all will agree that their bodies have not been preserved, but have returned to dust, like those of others. Besides, the words body, soul and spirit are in the singular, not in the plural.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTIONS WITH INSPIRED ANSWERS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Question.—Are the promises to the saints of the Gospel Age heavenly or earthly promises?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“As we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.” We are “partakers of the heavenly calling.”—-1 Cor. 15:49; 2 Tim. 4:18; Heb. 3:1; 6:4; Phil. 3:14; Eph. 2:6, 7; </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font8"> Thess. 1:11, 12; 2 Tim. 1:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—Will the elect Church, the “overcomers,” the “saints,” continue to be human beings, “of the earth earthy?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“God hath given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these we might become partakers of the divine nature”—“new creatures.”—2 Pet. 1:4; 2 Cor. 5:17; Rom. 8:17, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—When will the full change (begun in us by a change of heart, called the begetting of the spirit) be completed?—When shall we be made like Christ our Lord?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“We [saints] shall all bo changed.” . . . “The dead [saints] shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye . . . this mortal shall put on immortality.” “Sown a natural [animal] body, it is raised a spiritual body.” “Thus is the [special] resurrection of the [special, elect] dead.”—1 Cor. 15:50-53, 42-44; Phil. 3:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question. — Are full recompenses, either rewards or punishments, to be expected before the resurrection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer. — “Thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.” —Luke 14:14; Rev. 11:18; Matt. 16:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—What is the hope held out for all except the elect Church of the Gospel Age?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“The whole [human] creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now, waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God [the saints].” Then shall follow “times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began,” in which “all the families of the earth shall be blessed” through the elect “Seed” of Abraham.—Rom. 8:22, 19; Acts 3:19-21; Gal. 3;16, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—Are the dead conscious or unconscious ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“The dead know not anything.”—Eccl. 9:5; Psa. 146:4; Isa. 38:18, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—Have the departed saints been praising the Lord all along during the past ages?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“The dead praise not the Lord.”—Psa. 115:17. 6:5; Eccl. 9:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—Did the prophets receive their reward at death? or was it reserved in God’s plan to be given them at the beginning of the Millennium, the age of judgment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“The time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldst give reward unto thy servants the prophets,” is at the beginning of the sounding of the last trumpet, the seventh trumpet, at the end of the Gospel Age.—Rev. 11:15, 18; Psa. 17:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—Were the apostles promised translation to heaven at death?— or must they wait for the Lord’s second coming?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“As I said to the Jews, Whither I go ye cannot come; so now I say to you [apostles],” “I will come again and receive you unto myself.”— John 13:33; 14:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—Was it proper for the saints of the Gospel Age, except such as would be living at the time of the Lord’s return, to expect to be crowned at death?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“When the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye&lt;shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.”—1 Pet. 5:4; 2 Tim. 4:8; 1 Pet. 1:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—Did the Apostles expect glory at death or at the second coming of Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“When Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.”—Col. 3:4; 1 John 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—Were the saints to “shine” in death?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, . . . and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament [as the sun].”—Dan. 12:2, 3; Matt. 13:40-43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—Were the ancient worthies rewarded at death?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“These all died in faith, not having received the promises; . . . that they without us should not be made perfect.”—Heb. 11:13, 39, 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—David was one of the holy prophets: Was he rewarded by being taken to heaven?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“David is not ascended into the heavens.”—Acts 2:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—How many had gone to heaven up to the time of our Lord’s ascension?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man.”—John 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—Can he who created man destroy him? Can the soul be destroyed by its Creator?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“Fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna [the ‘Second Death’].” “He spared not their souls from death.” “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.”—Matt. 10:28; Psa. 78:50; Ezek. 18:4, 20; Psa. 22:29; Joshua 10:35; Isa. 38:17; Psa. 56:13; 30:3; 119:175; Matt. 26:38; Isa. 53:10, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—How great importance did the Apostle Paul attach to the doctrine of the resurrection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—“If there be no resurrection of the dead, then is not Christ risen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. . Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.”—1 Cor. 15:13-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—Are the unjust now being tormented in some unknown hell? or do they always meet the full penalty of their unrighteousness in the present life?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Question.—What will be the end of those who when tried are found incorrigible—wilfully wicked?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer.—They shall “go away into a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">cutting</span><span class="font8"> off from life,” “be punished with everlasting destruction [a destruction which will never be terminated by a resurrection];” for still “The wages of sin is death,” “the Second Death;” and. still the gift of God, eternal life, is to be had only in Christ. “He that hath the Son hath life;” he that hath not the Son shall not receive that gift.—.

<p><span class="font8">Questions for the Reader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—If hell (sheol) is a place of living torture, lighted with flames and hideous with the curses of its occupants suffering torture, either mental or physical, why do the Scriptures declare it to be a place or state of silence, darkness, forgetfulness and absolute unconsciousness?—Psa. 88'3-1?• 6:5; Job 10:21, 22; Eccl. 9:10;' Psa’. 146:4; Isa. 38:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Question.—If God is able to destroy both soul and body in the Second Death, and if he declares that he will destroy the wilfully and intelligently wicked, will not this prove that there will be no such thing as everlasting sin and everlasting agony? And does not this clear God’s character from charges of injustice?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. Question.—Are not these propositions intimately associated with all the doubts which have troubled you since you became a Christian, and perhaps before? And would not their Scriptural solution greatly assist in rooting, grounding and establishing your faith in the Bible as the inspired Word of God?

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Give Diligence, Brethren* to Make Your Calling and Election Sure.&quot;—2 Pet. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">i:io.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Throughout the length and breadth of this land of liberty, young and old understand full well the significance of election. Councilmen, aidermen, mayors of cities, county officials, State officials, United States Congressmen, Senators, the President and Vice-President are chosen or elected from amongst the people to their various official stations. They are chosen with a view to the blessing that will accrue to the •electors by the exercise of their official positions. How strange, then, that we who are so familiar with these things should read into our text so very different a view of election!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The thought should naturally suggest itself to us that if God is electing or selecting a Church in the present time, it must be with a view to the use of that Church subsequently to serve in some manner the interests of the remainder of the world, from amongst whom they were elected. And this is just what the Scriptures teach; namely, that Christ Jesus himself is the Head, the Captain, the Chief Ruler, and that this “elect” company are, figuratively speaking, his “members,” his associates, his under-priesthood. The Scriptures tell us that this selection is according to Divine foreknowledge and foreordination. They tell us that God foreknew our Lord Jesus as the one who would occupy the glorious position of Prophet, Priest, Mediator and King of the world during the Millennium. They tell us also that the same God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ foreknew us also and '“predestinated” that there should be a Church class selected from amongst the world, to be their Redeemer’s associate, his underTpriesthood, his subordinate kings during the Millennium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Elect Now and Hereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Church is spoken of as God’s ■“elect” now, before the election has been finished; before the testing is completed; before the called have been proven faithful and worthy. These are “elect” in the sense of having been nominated—“moved and seconded.” God moved that they should be elected, and “called them with a heavenly calling.” It remained for the called ones themselves to “second the motion” by presenting themselves in full consecration of heart to the Lord. But this was not sufficient; for the invited ones were recognized as imperfect and unable to come up to the requirements of the call. Hence it was necessary that the Lord Jesus Christ should become their surety and agree out of his own fulness of merit to supply all of their lack, their imperfection. And this he gladly does by applying for such the merit of his sin-atonementsacrifice finished at Calvary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Making the Election Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Keeping before our minds that the heavenly Father made the motion or the call, that we seconded it by accepting the call upon its terms of faith and consecration unto death, and that our Lord Jesus is our surety who will make good our unintentional blemishes, what shall we say of the prospects of our being elected and at whose door shall we lay the responsibility if we are not elected? Surely the unchangeable God who nominated us has made every provision for our election and will co-operate. Surely our Redeemer, our Surety, our Advocate, will give us every assistance in the way and, according to his promise, cause all things to work together for our good. Just as surely, therefore, the entire responsibility for failure would lie at our door. And this is what St. Peter in our text declares, “Make your calling and election sure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From this standpoint we have a special interest in our own election, such as we never had before when we misunderstood the entire matter. Once in our ignorance we thought that St. Peter had written foolishly about our making the election sure; fofl according to the erroneous theory which we had “swallowed” without proper mastication, God was doing all the electing himself, and had unalterably fixed our destiny as eternal glory or eternal suffering, long centuries before we were born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This erroneous view blinded our mental sight from all the various incentives which now are so precious and so helpful. What had God elected us to be and to do? To sit upon a cloud and to play upon a harp .and to sing to all eternity, cheerfully looking over the battlements of heaven to see our dear friends writhing in torment — and striving hard to praise God for it all and to think of his course in our election and their damnation as the exemplification of Justice and of Love?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We read indeed in the Scriptures respecting a Kingdom, for which our Lord taught us to pray, “Thy King? dom come; thy will be done in earth as it is done in heaven,” yet the thraldom of error upon us was so tense that we recognized not the inconsistency between these promises and our false hopes. Now, thank God, “the mystery” is revealed to us in God’s Word and by his Spirit, and we perceive that the Millennial Kingdom is to be a reality and that its blessing to mankind in general, “to all the families of the earth,” is to be most thorough, most systematic, most complete, and in the end entirely satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Kings to Be Elected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What an interest we properly take in this matter of our election, after learning that the office for which we are running is a combination of priesthood and kindship! The elect are to be priestly kings, or, otherwise styled, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“a </span><span class="font8">Royal Priesthood.” Their glorious service is to be for a period of one thousand years, during which they will be kings and priests unto God and will reign on the earth (Revelation xx, 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They will not “reign on the earth” in the sense of being earthly beings, having earthly courts and thrones; their resurrection “change” will constitute them heavenly or spirit beings; they will be invisible to mankind, as now the “Prince of this world” is invisible and as the holy angels are invisible. But they will possess heavenly power and authority and wisdom and grace. By these glorious attributes they will be able to serve God and humanity by a reign of righteousness, whose uplifting or restitution influences (Acts iii, 21) will begin with the living generations, but eventually extend to “all the families of the earth,” who have been going down for the past six thousand years into the great prison-house of death—“prisoners of hope,” however, because of the promise of God’s Word and the redemption sacrifice of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">My beloved hearers, if your hearts are not moved by this message of God’s grace and this information respecting his Kingdom and of your prospects of becoming kings and priests in that Kingdom, it is because you do not believe the message—because your faith does not properly grasp the “exceeding great and precious promises” of God’s Word (II Peter i, 4). I am aware that this whole message by Jesus and his apostles has been so long covered by the rubbish of “the dark ages” that it was lost to our sight for a long while, and sadly we missed its encouragement to faithfulness. I am glad, however, that now our eyes of understanding are opening to see the length and breadth and height and depth in the great Divine Plan of the Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Value of Earthly Crowns^</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Consider for a moment what fabulous prices have* been paid for earthly crowns! Thousands of lives have been sacrificed and millions of money, to gain an earthly crown. And thousands who paid this price knew well that “uneasy rests the head which wears the crown.” They knew well, too, that its tenure would be precarious and that the attainment of it would bring them lasting hatred from others who aspired to the same position and who considered that their right to it was as good or better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What comparison should we institute as between the value of such a crown and the “crown of glory,” honor and immortality which God has promised to his elect—to such of them as make their calling and their election sure! Has God placed too high a valuation upon the heavenly crown, in demanding that those who would share it with the Reedemer must prove their loyalty to him and to the principles of righteousness, and to the spirit of love, to the extent of laying down their lives in his service and in “doing good unto all men as they have opportunity, especially to the household of faith”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our Lord asked wherein would be the profit to any man if he were to gain the whole world and lose his own soul—lose his future life. For the purpose of our present topic we might ask a modified question, namely: If one should gain the empire of the whole world and all of its riches, and if another should gain this heavenly election to the heavenly Kingdom of one thousand years and to subsequent eternal blessings with the Lord, which of these would choose the better part—which would show the real wisdom, and which would be the foolish one? But the contrast increases when we note that the dominion of earth cannot be secured by our sailing through bloody seas, and that a mere competency of earthly wealth is attained by only one of a thousand who strive for it day and night. Surely from the standpoint of the Father’s Word all earthly honors are vanities, in comparison with the heavenly glories and blessings which may be surely attained by the “called” of this Gospel Age—if they will but follow the Divine directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">* Terms and Conditions of Election.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In our context St. Peter tells us upon what terms the called and accepted may make their election sure. After calling our attention to God’s exceeding great and precious promises he tells us that they were given us to the intent that they should operate in our minds so as to influence our lives, in harmony with the Divine will, and that thus we may “become partakers of the divine nature, after having escaped the corruption that is in the world through desire,” — selfishness, lust (verse 4). He proceeds to amplify, and urges that such as have this hope shall give all diligence to the matter of adding to their faith virtue or fortitude. That is to say, faith of itself is very good as a start, but God requires more than this. As a condition of our acceptance for election he requires that our faith shall be of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">strong kind, giving us fortitude for all of life’s affairs; for all of our covenants with the Lord; for a faithful endurance of opposition, contradiction, etc., that thus we might be copies of our Lord Jesus Christ, as God has ordained all of “the elect” must be (Romans viii, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">29).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not only must we have a strong faith combined with fortitude, but we must also add “knowledge.” We required some knowledge of God and of our Lord Jesus and of the Gospel message before we could come unto the Lord at all, but the Apostle is not referring to this, our earliest knowledge. He is addressing Christians who have already taken the first steps. He assures us that they need knowledge to enable them to go onward in Christian development—knowledge in addition to their faith and fortitude. We have nothing to say against worldly knowledge, scientific knowledge, etc., when these do not cross or interfere with the Divine Revelation, but we are confident that the Apostle did not intend to refer to worldly knowledge, but to the greatest of all scientific knowledge —the knowledge of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How shall we know God? By study of his character. Our Lord Jesus it was who declared, “This is life eternal, that “they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (John xvii, 3). This knowledge at the present time is a secret knowledge and, as the Apostle says, a “hidden mystery,” which can be known only by those who put themselves into a certain attitude of heart and mind and conduct toward the Lord and his revelation. We are to study God’s character—to learn respecting his Justice, his Wisdom, his Love and his Power, by studying his revelation—the Bible. In it we see his dealings past, and his promises respecting his dealings future. And a correct appreciation of these gives us a knowledge of God’s character as exemplified therein. But since this knowledge is not stated in terms for the world to understand, it follows that only those in proper condition of heart and enlightened by the holy Spirit can receive this knowledge. It is taught only to the pupils in</span></p>

It must be so, since there are in circulation about three millions of copies of the first volume, “The Divine Plan.” The Bible and Tract Society of Brooklyn, N.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Still Remember “Bill Arp.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Such will be interested In the “Southern Philosopher’s” review of the first volume of Series I. He wrote some time before he died:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It is impossible to read this book without loving the writer and pondering his wonderful solution of the great mysteries that have troubled us all our lives. There is hardly a family to be the School of Christ. “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his Covenant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Graces to Be Added.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Apostle continues his advice as to things necessary to be added by those who would make their calling and election sure. They must keep adding, and the adding must be little by little and day by day. The knowledge we gain of God through his Word should lead us to greater moderation (translated, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">temperance, </span><span class="font8">in our common version). “Let your moderation be known unto all men” (Fhilippians iv, 5), moderation or balance in thought, in word, in action. God’s people may be called extremists by those who are not begotten of the holy Spirit and who know not “the mystery.” But even they should be able to charge immod</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">eration </span><span class="font8">only on the one score—our immoderation, our faithfulness to the Word of the Lord and to our covenant of self sacrifice as followers in the footsteps of Jesus. Our lives should be so moderate as respects business and pleasure and food and raiment, etc., that we should be examples of wisdom and moderation to all—extremists only along the same lines that Jesus and the Apostles were counted extremists by those who knew not, neither did understand “the mystery” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">their endeavor to be of “the very elect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Patience must not be forgotten. In addition to moderation, “Let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.” Next </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">add </span><span class="font8">godlikeness—general goodness, benevolence, benignity toward all. Add next brotherly kindness—in the natural family relationship, and also in the spiritual family, the Church. “Love as brethren” (ought to love). “We ought also to lay down our lives for the brethren.” Still further the Apostle urges that while all of the foregoing are elements of love we super-add </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">love </span><span class="font8">itself in the fullest sense toward the Lord, toward the brethren, toward humanity, toward the brute creation and toward our enemies. While all of these cannot be loved in the same degree, all should profit by the spirit of love in our hearts for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Ye Shall Never Fail.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now comes the climax of the advice to those seeking to make their calling and election sure (verse 8). “If these things be in you and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesu.s Christ.” And then, as our text declares, If these things abound and if we give diligence to the making sure of our calling and election and do these things, we shall never fail—we shall in no case fail of securing our election. God seeketh such for joint-heirship with their Redeemer in the Kingdom. God “seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The grand consummation of our election—our Kingdom honors and glories—is specifically referred to by St. Peter in the next verse, saying, “For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.” If, dear Brethren, we believe these things, let us permit them to control our lives—our words, our deeds and our thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">found that has not lost some loved one who died outside the church—outside the plan of salvation, and, if Calvinism be true, outside of all hope and inside of eternal torment and despair. We smother our feelings and turn away from the horrible picture. We dare not deny the faith of our fathers, and yet. can it be possible that the good mother and the wandering child are forever separated?-—forever and forever?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I believe it is the rigidity of these teachings that makes atheists and infidels and skeptics—makes Christians unhappy and brings their gray hairs down in sorrow to the grave—a lost child, a Lost soul! . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“This wonderful book makes no assertions that are not well sustained by the Scriptures. It is built up stone by stone, and upon every stone is the text, and it becomes a pyramid of God’s love, and mercy, and wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“There is nothing in the Bible that the author denies or doubts, but there are many texts that he throws a flood of light upon that seems to remove from them the dark and gloomy meaning. I see that editors of leading journals and many orthodox ministers of different denominations have endorsed it and have confessed to this new and comforting light that has dawned upon the interpretation of God’s book. Then let every man read and ponder and take comfort.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">J </span><span class="font7">EWELS have a value of their own, an intrinsic quality, and no doubt &quot;would be appreciated if they were very plentiful, but their appreciation is all &lt;the more marked because of their comparative scarcity. The figures and similes used throughout the Scriptures by the holy Spirit are full of significance, and this one as well as others. iWhen the Lord likens his faithful peo</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ple </span><span class="font7">to the precious stones, jewels, it signifies that there is an intrinsic value </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">©r </span><span class="font7">beauty that he appreciates, and it implies also that such characters are, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">3n </span><span class="font7">comparison with the world, very jscarce—a “little flock.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our text points to the close of the (IGospel Age, and not only tells us that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">(the </span><span class="font7">Lord will not gather his jewels .sooner, but implies also that the only ?class to be gathered at that time will </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">•be </span><span class="font7">the jewel class—he comes to make nip his jewels. We have here a contradiction of the ordinary thoughts on </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font7">subject: (1) That the Lord </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font7">been gathering his jewels all along for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">past six thousand years; evidently </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Bn </span><span class="font7">erroneous thought, since he has appointed </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a.</span><span class="font7"> day, in the end of this age, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">which he will gather, or make up, bis jewels. (2) It exposes the fallacy ©f the thought that everybody who is respectable, half-way decent, is to be gathered to the Lord, and share in his Kingdom; for it distinctly points out </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that a </span><span class="font7">very exceptional class only </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">will be </span><span class="font7">sought for and gathered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The class here described as jewels </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font7">contrasted with other classes in the context (v. 15), “the proud,” who have </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">much of </span><span class="font7">the success of the present time, and workers of wickedness, who </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">tempt </span><span class="font7">God, and are not; careful to please </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">serve him—and such evidently are the majority of mankind. The jewel Class is described in v. 16 as “They that ffeared Jehovah”—that reverenced him, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;and </span><span class="font7">that thought upon his Word.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But, we inquire, Where are jewels (usually found? The answer of the fig</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ure </span><span class="font7">is that jewels may be found in very (unexpected places, as, for instance, the diamonds of South Africa are sometimes mingled with the ordinary gravel, find sometimes imbedded in bluish-black clay. They all require to be searched after, and generally require </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">be washed from the mire, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">before being prepared </span><span class="font7">to refract the light. So Borne of these “jewels,” whom the Lord 3s now seeking out from the world, are found in the ordinary walks of life, and Etome came from deep down in the mire </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">sin. In the world of mankind the Lord does not expect to find the jewels 3n perfect order, shaped, cut, polished and ready for the setting in glory. On the contrary, by one class of his servants he lifts them out of the mire of Sin and out of the horrible pit, and washes them, cleanses them from sin through the merit of his own precious blood, and through his Word; and then through other servants and providences </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">(he </span><span class="font7">polishes them with divine skill, to the intent that they may reflect and refract the light of the glory of God—• the divine character,—justice, w isdom, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the diamond in its rough jtate, Uncut, unpolished, would have no more value than any other common stone for ■ordinary purposes, so those whom the Lord is selecting and preparing as his jewels are to &lt;jerive their ultimate value from the cutting, shaping, polishing, of their characters under divine providence; as it is written, “We are his workmanship.” (Eph. 2:10.) We cannot suppose the illustration to be perfect in every particular, yet we may readily see that, while divine grace is to be credited with the entire outcome —the beauty and grace of the finished jewel—yet nevertheless divine grace operates according to principles and conditions, under divine law. As the experienced diamond miners reject the 30ft clay and various of the hard stones, which is but <sup>r</sup>or a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.”—Rom. 5:3-5; 2 Cor. 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Abandon Us Not In Temptation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The lapidarist takes firm hold upon the jewel which he has already tested and proved to have the requisite jewel quality, and encasing it in a suitable instrument, he presses it against the friction, a lap-wheel, with just the required amount of pressure to cut away the roughness and unevenness, and to effect the necessary shaping and polishing. The process requires great skill, otherwise at times much of the value of the stone might be lost through misshaping; hence only skilled workmen are employed in this department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For instance, the celebrated Kohinoor diamond originally weighed nearly 800 karats, but in the hands of a poor cutter was reduced to 280 karats. Yet so much of a diamond’s value depends on skilful cutting, that more than one-half of its size was subsequently sacrificed in recutting it, to obtain symmetry, beauty, and refractive power, and nowi it weighs less than 107 karats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So it is with the polishing of the Lord’s jewels; their value depends: much on proper cutting; and this is entrusted only to the skilled hands of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom we are assured in advance that he was tempted in all points like as we are '—that he himself passed through similar experiences of testings, etc., a&lt;. the Father’s hands. He knows just what we need to perfect us, so that we will be pleasing and acceptable to the Father, to reflect and refract the light of his glory when it shall fall upon us in. our finished' state. A part of our lesson is to have faith in this great Master-Workman whom the Father has appointed to shape and polish us. We may require much more trimming on some sides of our characters than on others; and the disposition often is to “draw back,” to be not fully submissive, to fear that the Lord has forgotten and abandoned us in trial. But infinite wisdom assures us, guarantees us, that this is not so, and that to draw back would leave us “unfit for the Kingdom.”—Heb. 13:5; Luke 9:62.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The earthly lapidary imbeds in cement the jewel he is polishing, except the facet which he is grinding, so that neither he- nor any other sees it during the operation, except as he lifts it, cools it and examines the progress of his work; but all the while he knows just what is being done, for he has an instrument called a “Lapidary’s Dial,” which indicates the position of the jewel exactly, and avoids the poor cutting of olden times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And just so it is with the Lord’s jewels: “The world knoweth us not”—it has seen the wheel of discipline which has been cutting the Lord’s jewels for centuries, but it has not understood the necessity and value of the process. It may even have caught an occasional glimpse of the jewels, but not to any advantage—not so as to be able to know the real merit of their characters or the value of the cutting and polich-ing, for even the already finished facets are smeared with the cement and slime from the grindwheel. But the great, loving Master-Workman and Lapidar-ist-in-Chief knows and has explained it all to the “jewels”; and they know in part now, and by faith are trusting all the remainder, singing in their hearts, “He knows, He knows!” “He will not suffer us to be tempted above that we are able to bear, but will with the temptation provide also a way of escape.” Yes, the Lord knows just how much pressure to apply,—just how much friction is necessary—and will not willingly afflict us, or cause tribulation which he cannot and will not overrule for our good. And being thus assured that all things are working together for good to them that love God, his living jewels can “rejoice in tribulation,” knowing that it is working out in them the peaceable fruits of righteousness—of love, and that such experiences are essential, and that without them they could never be amongst tha gathered jewels.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">in seeking </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for those of the desirable </span><span class="font7">kind, so the great Jewel-Gatherer operates according to a principle in seeking for his jewels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Even as Many as the Lord Shall Call”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The hardness of the diamond may be used to represent character, and we are to remember that character belongs to the individual and not to God. Each of us must have his own character, and only in proportion as each has character can he hope to be accepted finally as a jewel, for those without character will not endure the tests. As the diamond-seeker lays hold upon everything in his path that gives evidence of hav-<sup>1 </sup>ing the diamond quality, so divine grace, operating in the diamond field of the world (Christendom, and wherever the Word of the Lord has gone), lays hold upon all who have anything resembling character. The soft, the plir able, the uncrystallized, are not being sought now, and coming in contact with divine grace are passed by. Only such as give evidence of character are thought even worthy of washing and. testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The hard crystallization of the dia</span><span class="font7">mond corresponds to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">willingness toward righteousness </span><span class="font7">in the individual; and unless there be such willingness toward God and righteousness there is none of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">jewel quality which the Lord is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">now </span><span class="font7">Seeking. Those whose wills are formed, crystallized, set, determined for righteousness, are they whom the Lord is now seeking. And here we have the imperfection of the simile; for, while all diamonds are alike hard, the great Jewel-Seeker accepts some in whom the crystallizing process is incomplete, and “helps our infirmities,” developing in us by his providences the quality of firmness for righteousness, at the same time that he polishes us.—Rom. 8:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But even when the rough diamond has been found, as before observed, it would be of no value, except as it could be cut—indeed, of less value than other stones and clay for many purposes. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">So </span><span class="font7">it is with those whom divine grace finds in the mire of sin, having, nevertheless, will or character desiring righteousness, truth, goodness, justice,—“feeling after God” (Acts 17:27); the great Jewel-Cutter, the great Lapidarist, must really </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">give them all their value, </span><span class="font7">by his wisdom and skill in shaping, cutting and' polishing them. Yet, on the other hand, he could not cut, shape or polish that which had not the quality or character, the will for righteousness, essential to the receiving </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">such </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">polishing. Those, therefore, who are </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">the hands of the great Lapidarist, and undergoing his polishing process, must first have passed through the previous experience of having been </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">found </span><span class="font7">of divine grace—found of the Lord Jesus; must first have been washed; and must have been accepted as having wills desirous of harmony with the divine mind. Therefore, they may take pleasure in all the trying experiences and difficulties through which our Lord Jesus causes them to pa s as various parts of the grinding and polishing process, necessary to their completion as Jehovah’s jewels, to be made up by the close of the Gospel Age, and to be get in the gold of the divine nature, to reflect the beauties of the divine character forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is in harmony with this thought that the Apostle encourages us to rejoice in tribulation, knowing that it is working out for us patience, experience, hope, brotherly kindness, love,—the various facets of th? jewel essential to it in the eyes of him who is shortly to gather his jewels. The Apostle again speaks of even the most trying and difficult experiences of the Christian life as being “light afflictions,” and he speaks of the present life as being, in comparison to the eternal future, but “a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">moment,” saying, “.Our light affliction,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“What Son is He that the Father Chasteneth Not?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our text, after speaking of the gathering of the jewel class, drops the figure and refers to the same class </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">God’s sons, saying, “And I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.” Here we have </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">distinction always held out, a's between those who are servants merely, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">those who are serving sons. Moses </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font7">faithful as a servant over his house (natural Israel), but Christ is faithful </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as a </span><span class="font7">Son, over his house (the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">elect </span><span class="font7">Church)—the house or family of sons, who have received the spirit of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">adop</span><span class="font7">tion, the holy Spirit. Although sons, yet they must learn </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">obedience no less </span><span class="font7">thoroughly than if they were merely servants. Indeed, as sons, it is all th© more necessary that they learn </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the les</span><span class="font7">sons of obedience to the Father; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">more, </span><span class="font7">much more, is to be. expected of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a son. in </span><span class="font7">his father’s service, than of one </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font7">is not a son. He is expected </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to en</span><span class="font7">gage in the service in the Spirit of his Father, moved by the same impulses </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">justice and love, because </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“begotteri again” </span><span class="font7">by that spirit of holiness. As </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">au </span><span class="font7">son he requires no less careful, but more careful, training than a servant; more careful disciplining at the Father’s hands; for is he not his representative and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">be his heir?—Heb. 3:5, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">64I </span><span class="font7">12:7; Rom. 8:15, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While these sonn arc not to he ‘’’'are<sup>1</sup>? from the polishing processes necessary </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to make </span><span class="font7">them acceptable as sons,—</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“ac</span><span class="font7">cepted in the Beloved”—nevertheless they are to be spared from something, our text assures us. Other Scriptures show us that this class is to be spared, (1) from the great time of tribulation, which is to come upon the whole world of mankind in the end of this age; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in. </span><span class="font7">harmony with our Lord’s words, “Watch ye, that ye may be accounted worthy </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to escape all these things that shall come to </span><span class="font7">pass, and to stand </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">before </span><span class="font7">the Son of Man.” (2) They are to escape the thousand years of judgment, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">trial, coming upon the world, which, has its beginning in the time of trouble of “the time of the end.” Thus </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the. </span><span class="font7">Apostle declares that this class of faithful sons, the jewel class, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“shall not. </span><span class="font7">come into condemnation [judgment] with the world.”—Luke </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">21:36; 1 Cor. </span><span class="font7">11:32; John 5:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nor docs this imply that the world’s trial, or judgment, will be an unendurable one; for, quite to the contrary, we are assured that it will be most favorable, that the Lord “will judge the world in righteousness” during the Millennial Age. But for the Church to have share in that trial would mean a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">prolongation </span><span class="font7">of the period of trial; it would mean also a thousand years of delay in entering into the joys of the Lord in the fullest sense,—a thousand years </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of de</span><span class="font7">lay in attaining to that which </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is. </span><span class="font7">perfect. And not only so, but, as we have seen from other Scriptures, and aS is implied in this Scripture, the class now being selected is a jewel class, differing in many respects from the world, of mankind in general, all of whom, have been redeemed, and for all </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">whom a way of escape will be provided, from the inherited Adamic sin and penalty, “in due time.”—1 Tim. 2:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Afterward It Yieldeth th© Peaceable Fruits of Righteousness”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nor are we to suppose that those who' are now pressed against the wheel </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">tribulation, difficulty, are thereby made miserable. Quit© to the contrary, they realize, as the Scriptures point out they should, a joy and peace which </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">world knows not of—which the world </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font7">neither give nor take away. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">And</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In speaking of us as sons of God, the Scriptures declare that we are in the school of Christ (the same thought as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">cutting of the jewels); and of those </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font7">will ultimately be accepted as sons, they show that they will be such as finish their course with joy,—such as will have complied with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">predestinated conditions; viz., </span><span class="font7">that all who will be of that son class (the jewels) must be cop</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ies </span><span class="font7">of God’s dear Son, who himself is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">greatest, most brilliant and absolutely perfect one.—Rom. 8:29, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The process of seeking the house of sons, the jewels, ’and polishing them, has already been in progress for over eighteen centuries; and the Scriptures Indicate to us that now the end of the age is upon us, the time for making up </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">gathering the~e jewels, and setting them in the glory of the divine nature, preparatory tf&gt; the new age in which </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font7">shall be exalted as the light of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">world. The </span><span class="font7">signs of the times clearly </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">indicate, </span><span class="font7">in harmony with this, that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font7">time of trouble for the world is nigh, even at the door, to prepare the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">world </span><span class="font7">for the coming blessings. Hence </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">we see </span><span class="font7">that if we are to be amongst the acceptable jewels, amongst the sons who shall be spared from the calamities approaching, we have need to give dili</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">gence, </span><span class="font7">and to cooperate with the great Master-Workman, that the shaping and polishing of our hearts, our wills, may </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">perfected quickly, and that we may </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">ready to share a glorious part, when </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font7">comes to make up his jewels, his loved and his own.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord, </span><span class="font7">through the prophet, indi-' </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">cates </span><span class="font7">that as soon as the jewels shall </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font7">been gathered there will be </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a general </span><span class="font7">change in his dealings with the world of mankind. Verse 15 shows </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">how </span><span class="font7">it is at the present time, while the polishing of the Lord’s jewels progress</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">es; </span><span class="font7">’the unfaithful and the worldly frequently seem to have the advantage; but v. 18 points out that after this polishing of the jewels is completed, and! </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font7">have been set in the great crown </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">rejoicing at the end of this age, “Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, betjveen him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now, while evil predominates, while “the prince of this world” (John 14:30) reigns unbound, and while “they that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">tempt God </span><span class="font7">are even delivered,” it would be difficult, by outward evidences, to judge of who are the Lord’s fa</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">vored </span><span class="font7">ones. Indeed, his favored ones, his “jewels,” seem to be less favored: and to have more afflictions, more trials, more persecutions, more difficulties, a narrower way, than others. And amongst them, consequently, are not found many great or rich or wise, but chiefly the poor of this world, rich in faith, and prospectively heirs of the Kingdom (Jas. 2; 5). But when these shall be glorified with their Lord in the Kingdom—then there shall be a gener</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">al </span><span class="font7">change, a turning round. No longer will the wicked and those who tempt God be found in power and in influence and in prosperity, and the humble, the meek, the godly, suffer persecution </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">tribulation; but contrariwise, of</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Thieves in Paradise</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Luke 23:43.—This greatly misunderstood text explained in Vol. I, No. 7, of Peoples Pulpit. Send post-card for free sample. </span><span class="font7">that time, when Christ’s Millennial reign shall be inaugurated, it is declared prophetically, “In his day the righteous shall flourish,” and the “evildoer shall be cut off.”—Satan shall be bound also.—Psa. 72:7; 37:9; Rev. 20.2. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“They . . . Spake Often One to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Another”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But glancing back at the context we see another suggestion respecting the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">disposition </span><span class="font7">of this “jewel” class during their time of polishing. We read, “They that feared [reverenced] the Lord spake often one to another” (v. 16). Ah, yes! What could be more natural than a desire for communion with all who are of “like precious faith,” all who are similarly in the hands of the Lspidarist, undergoing polishing, all who are of the same character, disposition, as respects God and his righteousness? Our Lord points out that “love of the brethren” will be a marked quality in ail his servant-sons, for he that loveth him that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">begat </span><span class="font7">loveth also him that is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">begotten </span><span class="font7">of God. (I John 5:1.) And the tendency of the mutual love of the “brethren” is to meet frequently and (personally or through the printed or written page) to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">speak </span><span class="font7">to each other. The Apostle Paul distinctly calls to our attention the propriety, yea, the necessity, for this class meeting together. He exhorts, “Forget not the assembling of yourselves together, .... and so much the more as ye see the day [the day of gathering of the ‘jewels’] drawing nigh.” It is to the same end that our Lord has made some of his promises to his people collectively saying, “When two or three of you are met in my name, there am I in the midst.”—Matt. 18:20; Heb. 10:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a thought also in the word! “together”; the sons of God are not merely anxious for a meeting in which the world, the flesh and the devil will commingle—they are anxious specially for fellowship with each other, with those who have similar characters, similar faith in the precious blood, similar consecration, and who are similarly passing through the hands of the great Polisher, to be prepared for association in glory. This desire for fellowship with one another is not selfishness, nor an impropriety; on the contrary, our L’ord declares that those who love the light come to the light, while those who love darkness shun the light; and the Apostle inquires, “What communion hath light with darkness?” and he points out distinctly that while Satan and the children of darkness may simulate the table of the Lord and the grace of his truth, yet there is no real harmony or fellowship between their table and the Lord’s table, upon which he sets forth the precious truth for his beloved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we read that these faithful “spake together,” we naturally inquire respecting the topic of their converse, the subject upon which they communicate. It is not stated here, but is clearly stated elsewhere in the inspired! Word. The Apostle points out that such “mind heavenly things,” and contrasts them with others of the earth, earthy who “mind earthly things,” and whose god is their belly. Their converse, therefore, will not be respecting earthly pleasures, food and raiment, the ambitions of the natural mind, the pride of life, etc., but will be respecting “the things which belong unto their peace,” the things which are uppermost in their hearts; for these are all seeking “first the Kingdom of heaven and its righteousness,” and in earthly matters are “content with such things as they have,”—as the Lord’s providence shall arrange for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The New Song in Their Mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Neither do they come together to lament the trials and difficulties by the way, although there may be some occasions when the majority may “weep with those that weep.” Usually, however, the proper condition is that in which each should live so in the light </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ef </span><span class="font7">the Father’s countenance that the trials and difficulties of the present life, which would be terrible and burdensome to the world unsustained by divine grace, will be to these but “light afflictions;” and as children of the heavenly King, instead of going mourning all their days, they will rejoice— rejoice in the tribulation and adversity, as well as in prosperity. Accordingly, as the sentiment of this class, it is written,—“He hath put a new song in my mouth, even the loving kindness of our God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is quite in harmony with this that the Apostle prays for some, that they may be enabled to “comprehend with all saints the length and the breadth, the height and the depth of the love of God which passeth all understanding.” Those who have received this “new song,” and have comprehended its meaning, with the saints in general, will have, in this love of God, and in the wide and deep, high and glorious plan of God for the salvation first of the elect Church, and subsequently of the world of mankind—“whosoever will”—an abundant theme, a never-ending theme, a theme above all others, which will fill their hearts and fill their minds. It will crowd out worldly</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">topics, as being not worthy to be compared. It will crowd out complainings; and murmurings, as being wnolly improper on the part of those who have been recipients of so many divinefavors, and “much advantage every way,” in that we have delivered unto us the divine oracles—and especially in view of our adoption into the family of God as sons and “joint-heirs with Jesus Christ our Lord, if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.”—Rom. 8:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While it would be wholly improper for the consecrated ones to thrust out others who desire to meet with them, or to attempt to judge the hearts of those who profess faith in the ransom and full consecration to the Lord, yet to the extent that those who have received the holy Spirit of adoption let their light shine out properly, and seek to “edify one another,” and to “build one another up in the most holy faith,” in that proportion the insincere, the unconsecrated and the hypocritical, will find less and less to attract them. And in consequence “those who fear the Lord and who think upon his Word” find all the more of blessed spiritual communion and edification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The class of whom the Apostle says that they are sensual, earthly, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">having not the Spirit </span><span class="font7">of the Lord, make disturbance when they come amongst the true sons of God, and do injury, because with them as with others it is true, as it is written, “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,” and their hearts, filled with pride, selfishness, vain-glory and ambition, overflow through their mouths; and communication with such is unprofitable. From such evil hearts come evil words of envy, slander, hatred, malice, strife, selfish suggestions contrary to the Woid and Spirit of the Lord. Such edify no one; their influence is always pernicious; they build not up in the most holy faith, but, on the contrary, tend to develop and to cultivate roots of bitterness, whereby often “many are defiled.”—Heb. 12:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who fear the Lord, who reverence his name, who think upon his ? Word, who are seeking to copy his disposition, and to be fashioned under the hand of divine providence, should see to it that the class we have described, of whom the Apostle declares that their envy, malice, hatred, strifes, etc., are works of the devil, do not get ’opportunities to work their evil works.<sup>1 </sup>They should do this, first, by showing their disapproval of all evil speaking and evil works; and those who cannot show their disapproval by words of kindly admonition, pointing out that such things are not from God, but from the Adversary, should at least manifest their disapproval in their withholding any look of sympathy with such a course and by breaking off the conversation, and very generally avoiding the company of such; and by the</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">more strict attention to their own words and conduct, that therein they may “show forth the praises of him who hath called us out of darkness into his marvelous light.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another thought in this connection that we should not overlook, is that brought to our attention in the words, “And the Lord hearkened and heard it.” How often would the sons of God be greatly blessed as they meet together to talk over the divine plan, the divine goodness, wisdom, love, justice, and to help one another, and to encourage one another with psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, and by refreshing one another’s minds with the exceeding great and precious promises which belong to them that reverence the Lord,—how much would such be blessed, if they could always have in memory this statement, that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord is hearkening, </span><span class="font7">is listening to our conversation when we speak together. He listens to see who, out of good hearts, speak forth those things which are loving, gentle, pure, good, true, as distinguished from those who are careless of the truth, and whose words are vain or frivolous, or Worse than this, slanderous, enmitous and selfish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let all the sons of God remember the importance of honesty, “truth in the inward parts,” when they come together as members of the Body of Christ, to study the divine Word, and to help one another, and “let nothing be done through strife or vain glory,” but let each esteem the other greater in saintliness than himself,—seeking to see in each other, so far as possible, the good, the noble, the true; and let each seek to watch his own heart, and to know of his own blemishes. Thus let personal humility and love of the brethren keep pace with our growth in knowledge of divine things; otter-rise let us be assured that we are in the sifting and separating time, and oat all who have not this spirit of humility, patience, gentleness, brotherly kindness, love, will surely be separated.—1 John 2:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some will not be amongst those who are gathered as jewels, because the jewels which the Lord will gather will be pure, “first-water” d amends—stainless. They are to be faultless in love before the Father; and perfect love not only casts out fear, but casts out also selfishness, animosity, evil surmises and evil speakings as well as self-love, pride. Oh, how beautiful will be the Lord’s Jewels! How full of meaning is the statement that our Lc -d Jesus, the great Jewel, polished by the divine hand, and af<sup>4</sup>er whose likeness we are to be polished, “shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired [Head and Body] of all them that believe in that day,” by all those who, during the Millennial day, come into harmony with God, through Christ, under the terms of the New Covenant sealed by the precious blood.—2 Thess. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1:10.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Intelligent people appear to reason ■upon every subject under the sun except on religion. Approach a man upon any matter of industry or social progress or political economy or finance and we find him reasonably alert to the general law of Cause and Effect, but when it comes to religion the same man refuses to recognize or follow such laws. To illustrate: If a thousand religious men and women were asked to give some general outline of the Divine Plan under which humanity is being dealt with by the Almighty, Nine Hundred and Ninety-Nine of them would look at you in blank astonishment as though it were absurd to suppose that God would conduct his affairs along the lines of •order, reason and common sense— Cause and Effect. On the contrary the Scriptures everywhere hold that our Creator is systematically ordering the affairs of earth and “working all things according to the counsel of his own will” (Ephesians, i, 11).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">St. Peter divides the world’s history into three great epochs, which our -common version Bible designates as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“worlds”</span><span class="font7"> The first of these, he says, lasted from the creation of our first parents to the flood. The flood was the harvest time, the reaping time, of that epoch. It was the conclusion to the course of sin which, he tells us, there prevailed. And only eight persons, Noah and his family, were carried over as a nucleus for another great epoch or “world,” which St. Peter calls, “The world that now is,” .and which St. Paul calls, “This present evil world” or epoch, and of which Jesus states, “My kingdom </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is </span><span class="font7">not of this world (epoch)” while again he informs us that Satan is “the Prince of this world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Certain things have been in progress—certain great instructions and blessings from the Almighty during this long period of over Forty-three Hundred years. “This present evil world” or epoch is to have a harvest time and its affairs are to be as thoroughly wound up, completed, as were the affairs of “the world before the .flood.” Then a new epoch or “world to come” will dawn, the character of which is clearly delineated in the Scriptures as being very contrary in every way to that of “this present •evil world.” It will be “The world to come, whereof we speak,” the new epoch, figuratively said to have “a new heavens and a new earth,” in which the Lord will dominate human :affairs. His elect Church of the present time associated with him as his Bride, will constitute the “new heavens” or new spiritual domination under which human regeneration will bring the “new earth.” Under that new dispensation everything will be in accord with the character of its King, the Prince of Light and Righteousness, just as the conditions of “the present evil world” are in harmony with the characteristics of the “Prince of this world, who now work-eth in the hearts of the children of •disobedience”—“the Prince of Darkness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The World That Was.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “world” or epoch which end id at the flood accomplished a great work. It was during that period of Sixteen Hundred and Fifty-six years that God first tested Satan by permitting him t© have an opportunuity to show the traitorous attitude of his heart in connection with our first parents. Desiring to establish himself as an Emperor over earth, separate and distinct from the Empire of Jehovah, Lucifer became Satan, God’s Adversary, and has since continued in his opposite™ </span><span class="font6">tr. tho Divine will. </span><span class="font7">Our firs' parenis, tnrough Satan's lie, were led into disobedience to God, which resulted in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">death sentence</span><span class="font7"> on Adam and his race. Subsequently for centuries the holy angels were allowed to have intercourse with fallen men, with a view to helping them back into harmony with God, not that God expected any such results, for he already knew that there could be no recovery of humanity, except through the merit of the Redeemer, whose sacrifice would purchase the world and whose reign as the King of kings and Lord of lords would ultimately restore the willing and obedient of the race. But the angels to all eternity might have supposed that an easier way of saving men was possible; that if permitted they could educate, assist and uplift mankind out of sin and death conditions back to harmony with God. God not only desired to show that all such results were impossible, but also he desired to use the opportunity to test, to prove, the loyalty, the faithfulness of the angelic hosts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Amongst the liberties granted to all the angels at that time was the power to materialize—to assume human forms. We need not stop to discuss the possibility of this, for we are addressing those who believe the Scriptural record, and to such it will be quite sufficient for us to cite one of the many Scriptural instances; the case of the three men who appeared to Abraham and were subsequently found to be angels—spirit beings. They looked, talked, ate and were clothed like men. Abraham knew not who they were until subsequently they revealed their identity, as we read in the account of Genesis xviii. The Apostle Paul adds his testimony to this incident, saying to the Church, “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers; for thereby some have entertained angels unawares” (Hebrews xiii, 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For long centuries this relationship between the angels and mankind continued. We have no record of any human being receiving an uplift from their ministrations. On the contrary, as God had foreseen, the influence of sin was contagious and ere long some of the angelic hosts became so enamored of the daughters of men that “they took to themselves wives of such as they chose,” and preferred to leave their own habitation or spirit condition and to remain in a materialized form and to raise earthly families, although their course was contrary to the Divine arrangement and must have been so understood by them. Divine power was not interposed to hinder them. The error of this sedition, the leaving of their own habitation or plane of spirit being, from a small beginning, spread, and God’s non-interference justified the supposition that he was either not able to cope with the situation, or unable to enforce his own Law. Thus centuries rolled by, while the earthly children of “those angels which kept not their first estate” became “giants and men of renown” at a time when maturity was not reached for at least One Hundred years (Genesis vi).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During all those centuries we may be sure that every one of the holy angels had fullest opportunity to participate in the seductive pleasures of sin. And we may be quite sure during that epoch or age God demonstrated fully, completely, which of the angels were in heart and in deed<sub>t</sub> in spirit and in truth, loyal to him and to all the principles of his righteousness. This work having been accomplished, that “world before the flood” was brought to an end, was overwhelmed by a flood of waters, the Lord declaring that the whole earth had become corrupt through this evil.' The influence of the angels along licentious imes seemingly tended more and more to degrade humanity, so that we read that God beheld that “every imagination of man’s heart was evil, and only evil, and that continually.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“This Present Evil World.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This present evil world” differs from “the world before the flood” in that it is not under the ministration of the angels—but man, in a general sense, is left to himself. Since the flood, the world in general has been going on just as if there were no God, the exceptions, aside from the Jewish nation and the Church of Christ, being the destruction of the Sodomites and the preaching of Jonah to the Nine-vites, warning them that they were about to perish. In other words, so far as outward appearance goes, God has allowed the world to take its own course, interfering only when the corruption became so great as to make life injurious rather than a favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">St. Paul, reviewing the question of human degradation as exhibited in heathendom, etc., explains that the great deterioration in the human family is the result of man’s being left to himself as respects the Divine supervision. He says, looking back along the line of Noah’s descendants, “When they knew God they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful. . . . And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind”—they giving themselves over to things that were not profitable, defiling themselves, etc. (Romans i, 21-28).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This condition of things continued from Noah’s day until three and one-half years after our Lord’s crucifixion, when the special favor of God toward the nation of Israel terminated and the “middle wall of partition was broken down”—Cornelius being the first Gentile admitted to the privileges of the Gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the long period from Noah to Christ—-Twenty-Five Hundred years— God, as we have seen, had no dealing with the world, but he did have very special dealings with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and then subsequently with the nation of Israel. To those patriarchs he gave an Oath-Bound Covenant, that through their posterity he would ultimately bless all the families of the earth. Moreover, the character of the promise was such that it implied not only the resurrection of the patriarchs, but the resurrection also of all the families of the earth that have gone down into death under the great Adamic sentence (Romans v, 12, 17, 19).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The nation of Israel was segregated from all the other nations of the world and bound to the Lord and he to them by the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Covenant of the Law</span><span class="font7"> entered into at Mt. Sinai. Under the terms of that Covenant it was implied that that whole nation should constitute the seed of Abraham and rule and bless all other nations, but the conditions were the keeping of the Law perfectly. God, of course, knew that, as imperfect men, Israel had undertaken an Impossible contract. But he also knew that under his supervision the contract would not eventually be to their disadvantage, but the reverse. He used that nation as a typical people, their junilees representing the “times of restitution” (Acts iii, 20) coming to tne world under the Millennial reign of Christ. Their day Sabbath typified a coming blessing to Spiritual Israel. Their year Sabbath typified a coming blessing to the world, to the universe. Their Day of Atonement for sins typified the day of better sacrifices, of Christ and the Church. Indeed, we may understand that fleshly Israel and all of its great affairs were typical foreshadowings of God’s greater blessings to come in after dispensations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Jewish Favor Culminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The culmination of the Lord’s dealings with Israel was reached, as he had intended from the beginning, when our Lord Jesus left the glory of the Father on the heavenly plane and was made flesh, being born linder the Law Covenant. Not being </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a direct </span><span class="font7">member of the human family, but “holy, harmless and separate from sinners,” he was perfect and fully able to keep all the terms of that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Law </span><span class="font7">Covenant, and did so. Thus under the provisions of the Law Covenant he, and he alone of all the Jewish nation, could claim the rights of the Abrahamic Covenant—the blessings foretold and the rightful authority to bless men, for, as the ruler of earth, he took the place of Father Adam with all his rights and authorities described in Psalm viii, 4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By keeping these rights and privileges as a man our Lord indeed would have been an earthly potentate of considerable dignity, the highest amongst men. But the Father’s place for him and for the world was far higher than this. As an earthly potentate he would have ruled over a falling and dying race and would have been privileged merely to counsel, rule and direct their imperfect energies; but he never could have brought them to eternal life. Hence the Divine Plan was that he should </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">die</span><span class="font7"> as the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Redeemer </span><span class="font7">of Adam and his race, that thus he might have the just, the legal right to lift out of sin and degradation and death all of mankind who would fall in line with the gracious arrangements of the Divine purpose which center in Christ. It was in fulfilment of this feature of the Divine Plan that our Lord laid down the earthly Kingdom, the earthly rights, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all that he had,</span><span class="font7"> as man’s ransom price (Matthew xiii, 44). “Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time” (I Timothy ii, 6).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Every Knee Shall Bow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We now have Messiah exalted </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">in his possession the authority justly, legally acquired, whereby he may bless all the families of the earth— all the children of Adam, by restoring to the willing and obedient “that which was lost”—earthly perfection and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">do</span><span class="font7">minion. Where will he begin his blessing work? All the prophecies implied that Messiah would begin his work with Israel and that it should progress through Israel to all nations. But the prophecies did not even hint at the fact that before giving the “restitution” blessing to Israel, under the New (Law) Covenant of Jeremiah xxxi, 31, Messiah would first make use of his “restitution” authority for </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">gathering of a special class of people, “a holy nation, a peculiar people, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">royal priesthood.” This, as the Apostle tells us, was kept a “Mystery,” and, generally speaking, it is still </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Mystery”</span><span class="font7"> not only to Israel, but </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">the world. The gathering of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Spiritual Israelites was the first step in the new program. Those of the Jewish nation at our Lord’s First </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ad</span><span class="font7">vent who were of the right attitude </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">heart when transferred from Moses </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">Christ, from natural Israel to spiritual Israel. Then, as we have seen, from the time of Cornelius onward, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Gospel message has been free to all who have the believing heart </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">hearing ear to take it. These, as </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">whole, as our Lord intimated, are </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font7">a “little flock.” His words </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">were, </span><span class="font7">“Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Kingdom” (Luke xii, 32).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Kingdom, the life eternal, etc., which the Lord has to give away, are those of Adam, which were lost through his disobedience and re-purchased by our Lord at Cavalry. These he gives to his followers, the “little flock,” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">but not to keep.</span><span class="font7"> Earthly restitution blessings are theirs to sacrifice only. Whoever will not accept them on these terms cannot be Jesus’ disciples. Such are the terms of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">heavenly or high calling, bestowed upon his followers. They must take upon their cross and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">follow him in the sacrifice of earthly life and earthly restitution rights,</span><span class="font7"> if they would share with him the glory and honor that will </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">his in his exalted station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“The World to come”</span><span class="font7"> merely signifies the epoch to come, the epoch wherein dwelleth righteousness, where righteousness will be in the ascendant, and where sin will be absolutely under the control of the great Redeemer, who then will be the King of glory, ruling; reigning, enlightening, blessing, uplifting, restituting, purging, purifying, and bringing to perfection so many of Adam’s race as will heartily respond to the rules of his Kingdom. All others will be destroyed as brute beasts.—2 Pet, 2:12,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">QEAR SIR AND BROTHER:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even though differing from you in my views of the Law, I feel constrained to express admiration for the zeal with which you and your co-workers have endeavored to promulgate what you believe to be the truth of God. If we believe anything to be right we must act upon it until the Lord grants us to see otherwise. I had far rather be wrong and consistent than right and inconsistent, though it is best of all to be both right and consistent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">feel justified in addressing you as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">Brother in Christ because of the many points upon which we can hold harmonious fellowship. We look to the same Father in heaven. We trust in the merit of the same great sacrifice for sin. We are seeking light from the same inspired Scripture. We are both striving to live in the way that will be to the glory of God. We see eye to eye upon the nature of the soul, the penalty for sin, earth’s restitution to Edenic conditions, the Babylonian state of so-called •Christendom, and the impending time of trouble along financial, political and social lines. Then last, but not least, we each see the necessity of suffering with Christ if we would be glorified with him, and have already suffered a little of the scorn and derision which the world hurls at the soldier of the cross. The enumeration of all these points on which we are agreed will enable you to realize that what I am about to say respecting our differences is not meant in a spirit of wrangling, but solely for the purpose of sharing with you the blessedness and joy which has dawned in our hearts with this comforting light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A Greater Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">agree</span><span class="font7"> with our Adventist friends that God never authorized anyone to change the Sabbath of the Decalogue from the seventh day of the week, to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">first, but we do believe that just as truly as the Christian has a greater High Priest, and a greater sacrifice, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">greater tabernacle than Israel had, so, too, the follower of Christ has a much greater Sabbath than the follower of Moses. Everything under the Jewish dispensation was typical of “good things to come.” (Heb. 10:1.) The Atonement Day, the passover, the sabbatic years, the jubilees, etc., were all figures of more important things, so why should it seem strange that the seventh or Sabbath day was typical any more than the seventh </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">sabbatic year? But in order that you may see this to be the Scriptural thought hear Paul in Col. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">2:16,</span><span class="font7"> 17: “Let no man therefore judge you, in meat or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the new moon, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or of the Sabbath days: which are a shadow of good things to come; </span><span class="font7">but the body is of Christ.” The seventh-day keepers will argue that the Sabbath here refers to some of those yearly occasions, which were also called Sabbaths, because part of their observance required rest from ordinary labor; for instance, the Day of Atonement. Bi t this cannot be the meaning of Paul’s language, for he had already included all these yearly sabbaths under the words, “an holy day.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font7">harmony with his usual systematic forms of expression Paul first spoke of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the yearly </span><span class="font7">holy days, then came the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">monthly </span><span class="font7">festivals, the new moons, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">next </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">weekly </span><span class="font7">rest days. The Chris</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">tian has a </span><span class="font7">sabbath, too, but, as we shall </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">see, his sabbath is as much greater than the Jewish sabbath as the substance of a thing is greater than its shadow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You may ask: Did not the Lord in Ex. 3'1:16 speak of the seventh day Sabbath as being given for “a perpetual covenant”? I answer to this that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the very identical language </span><span class="font7">which the Lord used here of the Sabbath he uses elsewhere of the the harvest offering (Lev. 23:14), the Pentecostal sacrifice (Lev. 23 :21), the Day of Atonement (Lev. 23 : 31, 32) and the feast of tabernacles (Lev. 23 :41). The same Hebrew work “olam,” which is translated “perpetual” in the seventh-day reference, is the word translated “forever” in the other passages. See Young’s Analytical Concordanc-'. So if the Advent view is correct we should still be keeping the feast of tabernacles as well as the Sabbath, but as some of your own brethren have shown, when dealing with the punishment of the wicked, the word “olam,” like the Greek “aion,” really means “age-lasting,” or “lasting to a consummation.” It is sometimes used in the sense of eternal, but </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font7">necessarily. Thus in Ex. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">29:9 </span><span class="font7">we read of the priestly office being given </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">Aaron and his descendants “for a perpetual statute,” the same word “olam” being used. But that it does not properly mean “perpetual” in this passage is evident, for Aaron’s family lost the priesthood 1800 years ago. Note Heb. 7 :11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us keep in mind, however, that Christ’s fulfilment of the Law was not for the Jew who rejected Him. The Law has not passed away to such a one, but it still holds him in its bondage. Christ was the end of the Law only to the believer, as we read in Rom. 10:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A Higher Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then is the follower of Christ under no law? Yes, he is under a new law, a higher law. Just as he has a better High Priest, a better sacrifice, a better everything than the Jew had, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">so he has a better law, and it contains a better sabbath. </span><span class="font7">Isa. 42:21 foretold that Christ was to “magnify the law and make it honorable,” and we are now under this </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">magnified law. </span><span class="font7">The law said: “Thou shalt not kill,” but Christ magnified that when he taught that whosoever hateth his brother without a cause is guilty of murder. (See Matt. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">5 :21, 22, 27, 28.) </span><span class="font7">The Law said: “Thou shalt not steal,” but Christ taught us that we should not merely refrain from robbing our neighbor, but be ever ready to share with him what we had, even to the extent of laying down our lives for our brethren. (John 15:13, 14; 1 John 3:16.) The Law said: “Honor thy father and thy </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">mother,” but we are </span><span class="font7">instructed to “honor all to whom honor is due.”—Rom. 13 :7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now, dear brother, the Adventists see that Christ magnified the 1st, 2d, 3d, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th commandments, but they fail to realize that he magnified the 4th, the Sabbath commandment, too. To the contrary, they •believe he made it smaller. One of your brethren put it to me this way: “Before Christ every little act contrary to the Sabbath commandment, even the building of a fire, was to be severely punished, but since Christ’s sacrifice, so long as we try to do our best to keep the Sabbath, the Lord will pardon and overlook where we come short in our obedience to that command.” That would have magnified 'God’s mercy, but it would not have magnified the commandment. Would it be magnifying the 6th commandment if we should say: “Before Christ murder was to be severely punished, but since then, if you try to keep the Law—“thou Shalt not kill”—it will be all right if you do kill a man once in a while”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">All That We Are and Have</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let me now present our understanding of how Christ magnified the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Sabbath </span><span class="font7">Law. The Israelite was to consider </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">one</span><span class="font7">tenth of what he had as holy unto the Lord; but do we ever hear the Christian advised to rive a tithe to the Lord? (Not once. How much are we advised to give him? </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">All that we are and have. </span><span class="font7">We are to give all that we can, in as direct a way as we can, and the remainder is to be given him in a more indirect way; e. g., we give him the money we spend for food and clothing, because our body belongs to him and is being used to glorify and serve him. The food gives us strength </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to do </span><span class="font7">more for him, therefore the money' we spend for food is being spent for our Lord. (Rom. 12:1; 1 Cor. 6:20; 10:31; 2 Cor. 5:15.) In Luke 14 :33 our Master does not teH us to forsake or surrender a tenth, but “all that he hath.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Jew sang: ‘‘Some of self and some of thee.” The Christian sings: &quot;None of self, but all of thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Likewise the Jew gave God one-seventh of his time, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font7">the Christian </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">to give him </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">seven-sevenths. </span><span class="font7">The Lord said in Lev. 19:30, “Ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary.” The sanctuary was the holy structure through which God manifested himself</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">X </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> RICH MAN AND LAZARUS^</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All Christians have wondered re- </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">specting this parable. When taken Js literally it seems unreasonable. &amp;&nbsp;Why should a man suffer torture &amp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wt</span><span class="font6"> merely because he was rich, well &amp;&nbsp;clothed, and bountifully fed? And &amp;&nbsp;why should another man be car- &amp;&nbsp;ried to glory simply because he was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font6"> sick and poor and a companion </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of &amp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">V dogs? In the clear light now shin- v </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">V</span><span class="font6"> ing, this parable is luminous and X beautiful to such an extent that one x X is compelled to laugh at his </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">own x </span><span class="font6">foolish misunderstanding </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of it in </span><span class="font6">X the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The full explanation of this par- X V able is given in another number, X X which we shall be glad to send you, X X free of charge, upon postal-card X X request. Address, Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract X V Society, 17 Hicks St., Brooklyn, X X New York. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X </span><span class="font7">to Israel, so to them the word meant a certain definite holy place; ibut the Christian finds his sanctuary wherever he </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is; every place is a holy place to him. Similarly every day is a holy day, a sabbath of rest to him. He </span><span class="font7">has a better sanctuary to reverence and a better sabbath to keep. But not only does his sabbath differ from the typical sabbath, the nature of his rest also differs. It does not merely mean a cessation from manual labor, but a rest from laboring for self in order to work and live for God. It means to rest as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God rested after </span><span class="font7">he had completed the work of creation, as the Word expresses it: “To enter into his rest.” God’s rest does not mean idleness: “He sends his rain and causes his sun to shine” on the seventh just as much as on any other day. Then how did he rest? He ceased working for himself in order to work for man through his -Son. And how do we rest like him? By ceasing to work for self in order to work for him through Christ. Hear Heb. 4:10, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.” </span><span class="font7">And then Paul continues in verse 11, “let us labor therefore,” not let us cease from labor, but labor to put down those selfish propensities which would lead us, contrary to God's will, to live for self, instead of permitting us “to enter into that rest.” This rest of which the seventh day was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">type will not end with this life, but it will continue an eternal rest, begun </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">here </span><span class="font7">and consummated in eternity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let me digress here to say that God’s rest day was not a period of 24 hours ; but, like the six days of creation, was a long period of time. In our own language this is a very common use of the word “day,” and it is equally frequent in Bible language. (2 Pet. 3:8; Ps. 95:7-10.) While “the day of salvation” of 2 Cor. 6 :2 is already over 1800 years long, so it was with the great days of creation; they were long periods of time, and likewise the seventh day, in which God rested, is a long period; it is not over yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Every Day a Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But to return to the subject of this letter. In Isa. 58:13 we have a description by the inspired Prophet of what constitutes Christian sabbath keeping. We must refrain from doing </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">our own ways, </span><span class="font7">and from finding </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">our own pleasures, </span><span class="font7">and from speaking </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">our own words. </span><span class="font7">That is sabbath keeping. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">But the Christian must do that every day, therefore every day must be a sabbath to him. </span><span class="font7">For fear you may not apply the latter part of the verse to the Sabbath let me refer you to the Revised Version, which reads: “And Shalt honor </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">it, </span><span class="font7">not doing thine own ways,” etc. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Every day </span><span class="font7">we are to “speak as the oracles of God.” (1 Pet. 4:11.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Every day </span><span class="font7">God is to work in us “to do of his good pleasure” (Phil. 2:13). </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Every day </span><span class="font7">“the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord.” (Ps. 37 :28.) So again I say, every day is a sabbath to him who liveth “not unto himself.” Is not this a glorious magnifying of the Law?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We can now see how “'Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that believeth.” (Rom. 10:4.) We can understand why Paul could say in Gal. 3:19, “The Law was added * * </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TILL TH® SEED (SHOULD COME,” </span><span class="font7">and then in verses 23 to 2'5 he boldly compares the Law to a severe pedagogue to whom they were committed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">season, “but after that faith is come </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">we are no longer under a pedagogue.” And </span><span class="font7">we can comprehend why Paul mourns because “ye observe days” (Gal. 4:10, 11), and intimates that the brother is weak who “esteems one day above another”<sup>1</sup> (Rom. 14:5—read verses 1 to 7), failing to realize that they are all to be counted as days in which God’s glory is to be sought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Letter and the Spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, I </span><span class="font7">know 'how the seventh-day Adventists divide the Law into two parts, calling the Decalogue “the law of God,” and the remainder “the law of Moses,” and then claiming that Christ did away with the Law of Moses, but not with the Law of God. This is an awful mistake ; it was all the Law of God, because it came </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font7">him, and it is all the Law of Moses in that it came </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">through </span><span class="font7">him. (Lev. 26:46; Deut. 5:5.) Thus our Saviour, in Mark 7 :10, quotes one of the ten commandments (Ex. 20:12; Deut. 5:16), and then in the same verse a law which was not in the Decalogue (Ex. 21:17; Lev. 20:9), and yet attributes them both to Moses. He was not the author of either, but he was the agent through whom God delivered both commands. Furthermore, the fact that the Law, which -was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">until John </span><span class="font7">(Luke 16:16; iMatt. 11:13), included the Decalogue as well as the ceremonial features of the Law, is proved by Rom. 7:6, 7; for Paul, after saying, “we are delivered from the law,” leaves no doubt as to what law is meant by quoting from the tenth commandment. And as his words show we are no longer under </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the letter </span><span class="font7">(it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font7">the letter which was on </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the stones) ; </span><span class="font7">but under the spirit, the anti-type, that which was shadowed forth in the w,ords on stone, the greater law of love. (James 1:26; 2:8.) When we read, therefore, in the books from Acts to Revelation about the redeemed keeping “the commandments of God,” we do not think </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the letters in stone given through Moses, but of the magnified law of the spirit of life in 'Christ Jesus. (Romans </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">8:2.) </span><span class="font7">Notice another passage, viz., 2 Cor. 3 :3-ll. The expression, “written and engraven in stones,” and the reference to Moses’ face shining at the time, is evidence that Paul is speaking of the Decalogue. In verse 7 he tells us how the Law was accompanied with such glory that it even caused Moses’ face to shine. Then in verse 8 he refers to something which would be accompanied with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">more </span><span class="font7">glory, and following this up shows that ■when “the glory that excelleth” (v. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">10) </span><span class="font7">Should come then that which was given with glory—i.e., the Law written and engraven on stones—was to be “done away” (v. 11). Note the remarkable similarity between the Revised Version rendering of verse 11 and Matt. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">5:18. </span><span class="font7">Then in verses 12 to 18 Paul shows that while Israel had Moses cover his face </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font7">they could not see the glorious results </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the giving of that glorious Law, yet </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font7">should refrain from covering our hearts with the veil of prejudice, etc., as we wish to see the more glorious results of this more glorious law upon the hearts and lives of our brethren, especially as it was reflected in our great Elder Brother, the Lord Jesus.—2 Cor. 3 :18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Paul Preached Every Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dear brother, much more might </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">written, but I must refrain from more than one or two brief statements. Paul’s preaching upon the seventh day, etc., is no endorsement of seventh-day Adventism. That was a day when the cessation from labor brought the Jews together in their synagogues and gave Paul an opportunity which he gladly used. Wherever and whenever he found ears to hear he was ready' to preach. There were crowds in the synagogues on the seventh day, so Paul went there, and there were numbers at the market every day, so Paul preached there </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">on other days. (Acts </span><span class="font7">17:17.) So just as Paul esteemed those opportunities, so we esteem the opportunities afforded us on the first day, not because there is a divine command to consider that day </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">sabbath above </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">other </span><span class="font7">days, although we consider it a very appropriate day for meetings of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the peo</span><span class="font7">ple of God, being our Lord’s resurrection day. However, refraining from actual labor on the first day is not an endorsement of the wrong ideas many have held about it, any more than a belief in the Bible would mean an endorsement of the many wrong views which have been entertained of its teaching. It has been a great comfort to me to find that salvation did not hang upon such a slender cord as the keeping of a weekly rest day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are other features of the Sabbath, for instance its foreshadowing </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the Millennium, which I have not touched upon at all.

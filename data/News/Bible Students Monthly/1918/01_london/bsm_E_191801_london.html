<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>THE DRAMA OF THE AGES UNFOLDED</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>SATANIC STRATEGY DOOMED TO FAILURE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">T</span><span class="font5">HE greatest drama of the ages is now reaching a climax. It has been in progress for more than sixty centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The earth is the stage and all the people of earth, as well as spirit beings, are players. Satan is the chief villain, aided by a large retinue of servants and adherents. Christ Jesus is the great hero, whose </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">complete triumph In every respect is absolutely certain. </span><span class="font5">When the grand finale is reached, amidst music of unsurpassed sweetness and with jow that shall fill the whole, universe, every creature in heaven and on earth will bow the knee and confess that Christ is the Messiah, to the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This great drama opens in Eden, the garden of God, with Adam and Eve, the perfect pair in possession, clothed with Divine power and authority to multiply and fill, the earth and -to establish in earth a perfect kingdom of men and for men. They were without experience and needed an overseer and instructor. Lucifer, an angel possessed of great beauty and wisdom, was placed in Eden to oversee and instruct the perfect human pair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pride was in his heart, leading him to determine to gain control of the perfect man and woman and all their offspring, and thus establish a dominion of his own. In his heart he meditated: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the Most High ” (Isa. 14: 13, 14). Here. Lucifer fell from God’s favour ; and, losing his beauty of character, became Satan, designated as “ that old serpent, the devil” —the author and instigator of all the wicked-' ness that has cursed mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">hat “ A ciarn arte. Eve should not eat of certain fruit in the Garden of Eden, saying, “In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die ” (Gen. 2 : 17). To • accomplish his selfish purpose, Satan seduced Eve by convincing her that God was lying and thereby depriving them of their just rights by not permitting them to eat of the forbidden fruit. He said to Eve: ‘ ‘ God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof your eyes shall be opened ; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Ye shall not surely die </span><span class="font5">” (Gen. 3 : 4, 5). This was the first lie ever told (John 8 : 44). Mother Eve fell under the false representations ; and then Satan put the thought into her mind to induce Adam likewise to violate the command of God, by suggesting to his mind that if he did not follow her course they would be for ever separated. And so Adam wilfully violated the commandment of .God. .Thus Satan.had broken down the will of the perfect pair and assumed control of them by injecting evil thoughts into the mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The judgment of God followed swiftly upon Adam and Eve. They were driven from their home in Eden into the unfinished earth, there to earn their bread in the sweat of their face. In sorrow Eve must bear her children. In pronouncing this judgment, Jehovah said to Satan: “ I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">thy »«d and her seed; </span><span class="font5">it shall bruise, thy head,'and thou shalt bruise his heel” (Gen. 3:15). There God definitely declared that there would be two seeds, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">seed of the woman </span><span class="font5">and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">seed of Satan ; </span><span class="font5">and that from that day forward there would be enmity between the two. Subsequent developments in the great drama of Jehovah aS set.fqrth in the Bible show that the “ Seed of the woman ” here mentioned is The Christ —Jesus, the Head, and His faithful followers, the members of His body ;' and that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the seed of Satan is t(ie great Papal ecclesiastical system, the “ mother of harlots ’ ’ and her “daughters,” the other systems of churchi-anlty of which Satan seized control (Rev. 17:5; 2 Thess. 2 :1-41. The proof of this, which fallows, explains all the religious intolerance and wicked persecution of Christians in the earth during the past nineteen hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ANGELS IN CONTROL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan was deprived of his position as overseer of man. Adam having lost his right of dominion, there was none in the earth with authority. Horrified at the results of Lucifer’s wrongful course, the angels of heaven (sons of God) desired to uplift man; and God permitted them to attempt the task (Heb. 2: 5; Gen. 6:1-3). These angels were granted the power to materialize in human form and to assume dominion over the. affairs of earth. Satan determined that he would not be </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">thwarted in his </span><span class="font5">purpose. With malignant heart he set about to seduce these angels, his former companions in glory, and through them to retain control of man. He put it into their minds to take wives from among-1 the daughters of men, which they did, thereby leaving their lofty estate. Thus Satan cause ! the angels to sin and fall. The offspring i this unholy alliance and their progenitor filled the earth with violence ; and Get announced His determination to destroy ; .1 flesh in the earth. This He did in the gre. 1 Deluge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Noah and family, eight in all, not havii : been contaminated by these evil ones, r ceived favour in God’s sight and were saved in the ark which Noah budded at the directk 1 of Jehovah. Having power to materializ . this host of angels also had the power ■. &gt;&nbsp;dematerialize<sup>1</sup> and again assume spirit bodie:. Hence, when the great Deluge came, thev were not destroyed. The Bible plainly t41! = us that they were restrained of their libert y. “ God spared not the angels that sjnned, but cast them down to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tartarus,</span><span class="font5"> and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reseryi d unto judgment” (2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 6). In this condition of restraint, as the Lord declare,, they were to be kept until their judgment day. In the interim they have not been permitted to assume human form. God has arrange;! that when the time of theft final judgmer; i arrives, they must be released and granted more power, because it is repugnant to H<sup>:</sup>s way of dealing to put one on trial who </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">c </span><span class="font5">already undergoing a sentence. Since tl-c great Deluge, they have had power to communicate with the human race </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">only through the instrumentality of willing mediums ; and ‘ mis respect therr power fiasrueciuediy increased in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IMPERSONATE THE DEAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Scriptures, Satan is designated as “the prince, of devils” or demons (Matt. 12:24). In some manner Satan has dominated the other demons or devils. He is spoken of as “ the prince of the power of the air” and “the god of this world” (Eph. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2 : ? ; </span><span class="font5">2 Cor. 4 : 4). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan’s first lie was that communicated to Mother Eve : “Ye shall not surely die ” ; and ever since, he has kept before the minds of humanity the falsehood: “ There is no death.” The theory that every man has an immortal soul finds its only basis in this lie Of Satan. </span><span class="font5">Without that falsehood, the doctrine of eternal torture could never have found a lodging place in the minds of reasonable men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SATAN’S LIE DISPROVED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Man </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">a soul. He does not </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">possess </span><span class="font5">a soul. Man </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">became a living soul ” </span><span class="font5">(Gen. 2 : 7). A. soul is a living, breathing creature. The word “soul” is synonymous with the word “being.” Every being is a soul. God declared, “ The soul that sinneth it shall die ” (Ezek. iS: 4). An immortal creature cannot die. Satan himself is not immortal, because he will be destroyed (Heb. 2 : 14). The Apostle Paul asserted, “ God only hath immortality” (1 Tim. 6: 16) ; and that God promised and grants immortality to the “Seed of the woman”—The Christ, Head and body (John 5 : 26 ; Rom. 2:7; 1 Cor. 15 •’ 53- 54k Jehovah and The Christ (Jesus and His church) possess immortality ; no others do or ever will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEPTION BY DEMONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The evil spirits, styled demons, under the control of Satan, have aided him in carryingout this great falsehood. The fallen spirits are not only well informed in respect to all the affairs of earth, but they are also adepts in deceit. The demons often influence the mind of a human being, causing insanity or lunacy. When Jesus was on earth, He cast out many of these demons, as did also the apostles.—See Matt. 9 : 32, 33 ; 10 : 8 ; 12 : 22 ; Mark 5 : 1-20 ; 9 '■ 17-27 ; Luke 9 : 3-3-42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In recent years these demons have been able to overreach some of the brightest minds amongst men, as the subsequent facts will show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SATAN’S WICKED COURSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is clear from the Scriptures that Satan believed the “ Seed of the. woman,” according to the promise, was to be only a human seed. Children were born to Adam and Eve. Two of their sons,. Cain and Abel, came to offer sacrifice unto God. Abel’s sacrifice was more acceptable than that o<sup>f</sup> Cain ; and he Therefore found favour in God’s sight. Sat m r J.dm 2 : 18-27.) </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Any creature that would attempt to reign as the representative of Christ would therefore be Antichrist.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">;;t once recognized Abel as the piv im-eil seed, and immediately injected int &lt;&nbsp;the mind of Cain a desire to murder his brother, which Cain did. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">From that time on, Satan sought to destroy every person who seamed to have the favour of God, </span><span class="font5">even as Saul songnt to destroy David who. the Scriptures Sl. jw. was a type of the real Seed, according tc t e promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In due time. Jesus was born, as a num-child. All the prophets of Israel had iore-told the birth of the new King. He was the heir of promise. Satan recognized Him as the Seed and immediately put it into The mind of King Herod to kill the young child ; and to accomplish this purpose, the k<sup>;</sup>ng caused all the children in Bethlehem, under two years of age, to be slaughtered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SEED OF PROMISE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God made promise that the “ Seed &lt;&nbsp;f the woman” should not only bruise the serpent’s head, but should ultimately d. -tr &gt;v the “ Seed of the serpent,” establish a g&lt; • &gt;. Loment of righteousness in the earth, ana ' nng blessings to all the groaning creation. He specifically made this promise to Abra 1;am, saying. “ In thy seed shall all the natic- ; ot the earth be blessed” (Gen. 22 : 1-18). Th? Apostle Paul particularly identifies this promise with Jesus </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and the Church—trie members of His body—denominating such as the “ Seed of the woman,” as promise;! </span><span class="font5">(Gal. 3 : 16. 27-29). The. development of th s Seed began when Jesus consecrated t»e Jordan and was there baptized. He immediately went into the wilderness and S-tu. Tecopnizinsr lesus .?$ the ‘S- &lt;-*d ”. first opportunity to destroy Him (Matt. 4 : i-ii). When Jesus died upon the cross, Satan doubtless thought he had succeeded in his purpose to destroy the “ Seed.” Subsequently, however, Jesus arose from the dead and ascended on high. That was a surprise and disappointment to Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Pentecost, the body members, composing the remainder of the “ Seed of promise,” began to be selected and developed, which work has progressed until now. The body members of this “ Seed” are designated in the Scriptures under various names, such as, the Church, the bride class, the wheat, the Lord’s jewels, etc. Some of these have been found in the Catholic and Protestant Churches all through the age. The great Master gave a parable of the wheat and the tares (Matt. 13:24-40), showing that the “wheat” represents those who will be of the kingdom of God; while the “tares” are the children or offspring of the devil. He stated that both would grow in the same organizations until the end of the Gospel age, at which time the separation would-take place. During the Gospel age, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">millions </span><span class="font5">have been brought into the various church svstems. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">but the Lord definitely states that only 144,000 will be in the body of Christ, </span><span class="font5">constituting the “Seed” according to the promise (Rev. 7: 4 ; &nbsp;&nbsp;14: 1-3). To this</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">class God gives His exceeding great and precious promises ; and only to those who are overcomers of the world, the flesh and the devil will He grant a share with Him in His kingdom. Satan and his cohorts have ever sought to destroy this “Seed” of promise ; but God has safeguarded that “ Seed” as the “apple of His eye.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SATAN’S SEED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Development of the spiritual “Seed” according to the promise began with the baptism of Jesus at the J ordan. Satan understood that the “Seed” of promise was a seed only according to the flesh, and continued in this thought until Jesus arose from the dead. Then he began to get more light upon God’s purposes. At Pentecost he saw the beginning of the selection of men to whom it was declared that if they would prove faithful unto death they should be of the “Seed” according to the promise, this “ Seed ” being designated as the Church, or body of Christ. Thereupon Satan set about to devise ways and means to offset the “Seed” of promise by developing a “Seed” of his own ; and in due time he had his “ Seed” in full operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Antichrist </span><span class="font5">means </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">against Christ, or instead Of Christ. </span><span class="font5">The Christ—Jesus, the Head, and the members of the Church, His body—being the “Seed” according to the promise, it follows that Satan’s “ Seed,” which claims to be in place of Christ, is against Christ, therefore Antichrist. Even in the days of the apostles Satan was perfecting his plans to establish the Antichrist—his “Seed.” (See</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan Is an autocrat, and every autocrat has been one of Satan’s tools. </span><span class="font5">Rome, having become a world power, began to lose that power under the rulersbip of Constantine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">hristianity was on the increase. Satan desired to corrupt Christianity and to establish a counterfeit of Christ’s kingdom. He .duced the autocratic Constantine to believe that if he would profess Christianity, this would result beneficially to his kingdom. And Constantine did profess Christianity. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Thereby Satan accomplished a two-fold purpose, viz., the corrupting of Christianity by uniting civil and ecclesiastical power, and there began the development of his own “ Seed,” the Antichrist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In course of time, Pagan Rome became Papal Rome and dominated the peoples of the earth. The following quotation from Lord’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Old Roman World </span><span class="font5">will be read with interest :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BIRTH OF ANTICHRIST</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ It was not till the Fourth Century— when Constantine was converted ; when the Church was allied with the State ; when churches became both rich and splendid; when synods were brought under political influence: when monachists (monks) had established a false principle of virtue ; when politics and dogmatics went hand in hand, and emperors enforced the decrees of (church] councils—that men of rank entered the Church. When Christianity became the ^religion of the court and of the fashionable ‘ciasses, it was Used to support tue vuy cmis against which it originally protested. The Church was not only impregnated with the errors of Pagan philosophy, but it adopted many of the ceremonies of oriental worship, which were both minute and magnificent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ The clergy, ambitious and worldly, sought rank and distinction. They even thronged the courts of princes and aspired to temporal honours. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Church was allied with the State, </span><span class="font5">and religious dogmas were enforced by the sword of the magistrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“An imposing hierarchy was established. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The mission of the Church was lost sight of in a degrading alliance with the State. </span><span class="font5">Christianity was a pageant, a ritualism, an arm of the State, a vain philosophy, a superstition, a formula.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures show that the “Seed of the woman” is The Christ—Jesus the Head, and the Church His body. Jesus Himself designates the members of His church as a “little flock” (Luke 12:32). When Satan organized his “ Seed,” he had the Bishop of Rome made the head, designating him as Pope, who assumed the title of Vice-gerent of Christ, or the one reigning in Christ’s stead ; and the cardinals and bishops and clergy in general are designated as the “ hierarchy,” composing the “little flock”; while all those who come into the Papal system are in fact “children of the Church.” The hierarchy’ is the sacred governing body of the system, the word “ church ” being applied to the entire system. Murphy, a well-known Catholic author, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Chair of Peter </span><span class="font5">(p. 504), says : “ The hierarchy is the body of clergy •of Divine institution, governing the Church ; and. as defined by the Council of Trent, is composed of bishops, priests and deacons, or ministers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“ GREAT SWELLING WORDS ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Pope, the head of the “Seed” of Satan, is the earthly spokesman for that “ Seed.” The Lord foretold that he would speak great swelling words. (Rev. 13 : 5, 6). Monsignor Capel, a Roman Catholic writer of note, gives a list of high-sounding titles claimed by the Pope, of which the following are samples:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ Head of all the Holy Churches.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ Chief of the Universal Church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ Vicar of Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ Key-bearer of the Kingdom of Heaven.” <sub>: </sub>“ Ruler of the House of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ High Priest, Supreme Bishop.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ Head of all the Holy Priests of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ Christ by Unction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ Infallible Pope.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following, from Fox’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts and Monuments, </span><span class="font5">by’ H. G. Guinness, is also of interest : ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ I am all in all, and above all, so that<sub>( </sub>God Himself, and I, the vicar of God, have both one consistory, and I am able to do </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">almost all that God can do. </span><span class="font5">In all things that 1 list my will is to stand for reason, for</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Pope, as the head of the system, together wit^i his “little flock”—the clergy -—-asserts that the Millennial reign began in a.d. 800 and continued until the year 1800, when the system received a severe blow’ at the hand of Napoleon Bonaparte. 'Die Scriptures show that at the end of Christ's Millennial reign there is to be a “ I it tie season ” when Satan is to be loosed. Papacy claims that the little Reason” is Irani the year 1800 until now. In fact, a comparison shows that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the Papal system is a counterfeit of Messiah’s kingdom and that it constitutes the “ Seed ’ ’ of Satan, being designated in the Scriptures under the title “ Babylon, the mother of harlots ” ; and that the Protestant systems, dominated by the clergy, constitute the “ daughters.” —</span><span class="font5">Rev. 17: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD CONTRASTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that God has designated these </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">systems </span><span class="font5">as Babylon does not mean that all the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">people </span><span class="font5">in the systems are bad. On the contrary, the Lord shows that in these systems manvof His true saints have been developed, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">it is the system, dominated by an ambitious clergy, that the Lord designates as the “ Seed ’ ’ of Satan. It is the clergy who promulgate and teach the doctrines. For many centuries the clergy have supported Satan’s Ue: “ Ye shall not surely die ’ “ There is no death,” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Both Papal and Protestant clergy have taught the doctrine of inherent immortality of all souls and the doctrine of eternal torment. The Lord’s Word teaches that when a man dies he is dead. “The wages of Hu is death” (Rom. 6:23). “The soul that sinneth it shall die ” (Ez.ek. 18:20). When a man is dead, he is unconscious. “ There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest ” (Eccles. 9: 10). “ His breath goeth forth ; he returneth to his earth ; in that very day his thoughts perish.” (Ps. 146:4). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The &quot;&nbsp;hell ’ of the Bible Is the grave, the tomb ; and all who die go to hell and remain there until the resurrection. Even Jesus went to hell (the grave, the tomb), </span><span class="font5">as plainlv stated in</span></p>

By these, false doctrines Satan has deceived millions and “ blinded the minds of them Which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.”—2 Cor. 4 : 4.</span></p>

Russell, then began boldly to proclaim, the truth as it had not been proclaimed since the days cf the apostles. The very keynote to God’s wonderful plan of salvation is the ransom sacrifice—that Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for every man (1 Tim. 2 : 5, 6; Heb. 2:0). L’astor Russell plainly' proved from the Scriptures that death is the result of sin ; that the only way that leads to life is through the merit of the sacrifice of our Lord; that the “ Seed ” of promise, the Church, has been in course of development during the. Gospel age, and when finished, restitution blessings will be offered to all the remainder of mankind through this “ Seed.” God used him to turn thousands of people back to the Bible and to bring comfort to their hearts. Since then. Pastor Russell and those joining with bint in this work have gladly, at a sacrifice to themselves, sent the Gospel message to all narts of the world. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">This has greatly angered Satan ; and for the past twenty years he has.specially pitted his “ Seed ” against these faithful followers of the great Master, Satan has united practically all denominations in persecuting Pastor Russell and his associates.

<p><span class="font5">deceptions would be such that, if it were possible, even the elect (the promised “ Seed “) would be deceived. But God will not permit this deception to prevail. Referring to the close of the age. the Kevelator said, “ Babylon the great is fallen, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and is become the habitation of devils” (demons) </span><span class="font5">(Rev. 18:2). These demons, working under Satan, the chief of devils, have found a fertile field of operation in Babylon. It is a well-known fact, that the Czar of Russia was under the wicked influence of the demons, who operated on his mind for years .through Rasputin the pro-Gcrman medium to betray and wreck</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Accepting the devil’s falsehood, many men of great mental capacity have been deceived ; among them such men as Sir Oliver Lodge,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Sir A. Conan Doyle. Stead. Funk. Crookes, Meyers, Gurney, Hodgson, and many others. Without a doubt thev see and hear, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">but they are not communicating with the spirits of dead men. They are communicating with the evil demons above described. </span><span class="font5">The honesty of these men is not questioned, yet their “proof” falls flat if we accept the Bible as true. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The great majority of the clergy of Babylon, however, are higher critics and evolutionists, and therefore repudiate the the inspiration of the Scriptures and refuse the Bible’s testimony. </span><span class="font5">The Bible says that death is an </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">enemy : </span><span class="font5">“ He [Christ] hum reign till He hath put all enemies under His feet ; the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">last enemy </span><span class="font5">that shall be destroyed is </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">death” </span><span class="font5">(1 Cor. 15: 25. 26).

<p><span class="font5">But again Satan will be defeated'; because the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">death of the saintly oiies will bo their triumph. </span><span class="font5">As the Apostle declares, they shall not sleep, but shall be changed in a nfoment, in the twinkling of an eye. They,shall be “caught away” (literally, removed by violence) to meet the Lord and be for'ever with Him.—1 Cor. 15 : 51, 52 ; 1 Thess. 4 : 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The last members of the Church having been taken away, the peoples of the world will awaken to the fact that the nominal church system (Babylon) is the “Seed” 6f Satan ; and then, as shown by the Scriptures, “ a mighty angel took up a stone like a great , millstone and cast it ipto the sea” (overwhelmed eeelesiasticism in a great 'tirhe of destruction). This is the final cataclysm or time of trouble to which the Prophet Daniel referred and which Jesus also mentioned.— See Dan. 12 : </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1 ; </span><span class="font5">Matt. 24 : 21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY THE CHURCHES FAILED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The peoples of earth are now in the great transitory period. The greatest crisis of all time is upon the human race. Many are asking, Why has Christianity failed ? Why should this great war come when we have so many churches and like organizations ? The answer is found in the fact that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Christians In the church systems have been overreached by Satan, and his “Seed” has there predominated and controlled. The clergy have repudiated the Bible, they have turned the people away from it; their religion has been merely a veneer and could not regenerate the heart. </span><span class="font5">The spirit of Christ alone can bring regeneration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But let no true Christian at this hour be discouraged or dismayed. It is a time, for all such to be calm and sober-minded, to watch and pray. Be strong in faith, and remember the .Master’s words: “ He’that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.” To the order-loving people of the world the Prophet of the Lord says : “ Seek meekness, seek righteousness ; it may be that ye shall be bid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” Go quickly to your Bible and prove that the foregoing statement is true ; and learning it to be true, yon will be able to see, shining beyond the darkness that now enshrouds the earth, the light of hope, the Messianic Kingdom.</span></p>

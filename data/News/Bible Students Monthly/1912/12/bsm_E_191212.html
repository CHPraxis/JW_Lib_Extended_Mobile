<p><span class="font3">SAYS “HELL SCARE” IS DUE FROM THE PULPITS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although it is the devilish doctrine of Eternal Torment that is driving the best people of the churches into infidelity, there are some still foolish enough to believe that by thus blaspheming God’s name and character they can lead men to honor and obey the Creator. Alas, how great a mistake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Faster Russell and a few others are doing their best to stem the tide of Higher Criticism and Agnosticism by showing that in the Bible God has revealed a glorious plan for the world’s salvation; and that the Creeds of the Lark Ages and not the Bible originated the devilish doctrines of which all are now ashamed. It is said that Pastor Russell’s weekly sermons now reach 15,000,000 readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A sermon by the Rev. A. P. Gouthey ushered in the sessions of the Wabash Conference of the Free Methodists. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A hell scare should be put into the whole country by the preachers of the churches.” He told why he thought there was reason for such a scare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I am frightened at political conditions,” he continued. “Some people say that preachers shouldn’t get worked up about polities. The pulpit is the place for politics. If we leave to corrupt politicians the axe to grind, they will grind it. I tell you, conditions are awful. We can hardly depend on assemblymen, judges and juries any more. I hate to say it, but it is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We are on the edge of a volcano all rfeady for eruption. The rumbling is now going on inside. We are on the verge of a war between capital and labor. God doesn’t like America any more than He liked Sodom of old. We must keep our religious principles or God will forsake us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I know it hurts to know these truths. Some people want us preachers to talk about beautiful things and smooth over disagreeable things. We sing of “The land of the free and the home of the brave.’ God is being bowed out of the schools, bowed out of the colleges and bowed out of some of the pulpits. We are not training our children in strict ways. It is not tor the best interests of the child that he should be fondled and kissed instead of getting the birch put to him. This is getting to be an irreverent age.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">LONDON SCHOOL CHILDREN.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All Placed Under Municipal Medical Care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A new scheme has been adopted in London by which the whole of the elementary school children in the Metropolis will be placed under municipal medical surveillance during their school careers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In future there is to be treatment for every school child which needs it. There are 800,000 children in attendance at the 800 London elementary schools, and it is computed that’every year a quarter of a million will need medical treatment. Spectacles and surgical appliances will be supplied. Schools will be arranged for consumptive and other children needing open-air life. Nurses will “follow up” cases into the houses of the children, and for this purpose the scheme provides for the payment by the municipality of the fees of private doctors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The scheme passed by the London Education Committee provides, as it were, for the compulsory good health of the children, the State and the municipality taking to themselves the responsibility of discovering children who are ill and providing them with medical treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">—Exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">PRAYS FOR PERSECUTION.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Oh, God, send us another Bob Ingersoll to arouse the people,” was the plea made by Rev. Charles B. Mitchell, pastor of St James Methodist Episcopal Church, at the Desplaines camp meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“They sit in the pews, with dull, dead indifference that breaks our,hearts. It would be better if they threw bricks at us as they did at Wesley, but they don’t even talk back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This is an age of doubt. We ministers need more than apostolic succession in this scoffing, indifferent and Godless age. The pendulum, I believe, will soon begin to swing back again.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PURGATORY FIRES!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NO</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">T NOW</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, BUT SOON</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Some men’s sins * * * go beforehand to judgment, and some they follow after.”— </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Timothy</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5:24.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">RADUALLY, as the eyes of our un-derstanding open to the true beauties of God’s Word, we find that the gross errors of the past have, indeed, some foundation in tlm truth. Yet the two are so different that they might pass each other without recognition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As Bible students are allowing the Word of God to interpret itself they are being blessed; their faith is being strengthened as they find that the real teachings of the Bible are beautiful. and harmonious and God-honoring and acceptable to sanctified common sense. As so much of our confusion has been connected with the subject of future punishment, it is only reasonable that much of our blessing and enlightenment should come from a better understanding of the Scriptures bearing upon this subject. Our first lesson to learn was the difference between the Bible Hell and the hobgoblin torture chambers of our bewildered forefathers, who had not the Bible in their possession and who, if they had possessed it, lacked generally the education necessary to read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When we found that the Hebrew word Sheol is the only word translated hell during the Old Testament period of four thousand years, we were not surprised. But when we found that that word signifies the tomb, the death state, and that it is translated grave in our Common Version Bible more times than it is translated hell, we were surprised. And when further close investigation showed that the good, as well as the bad, go to Sheol, and that’ the Bible declares that all who go to Sheol were redeemed by Christ’s death, and that eventually He will destroy Sheol and deliver all the prisoners of death from Sheol—then we began to see what a serious blunder had been made in the translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But when about to blame the translators tor deceiving us, we found that the trouble lay rather with a change in the use of language. All know that all living languages are gradually changing. And investigation shows that in old English the word hell was used as a synonym for hole &gt;or pit, or something covered over, as the grave. Thus an English farmer in olden times might say, “We helled five hundred bushels of potatoes this fall”; or, “We helled (thatched) our cottage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fault was not so much with the translators as with the wrong idea already firmly imbedded in the human mind—not the teaching of the Bible— that God intends to punish in purgatory or eternal torture all except the saintly few. From the first Satan seems to have endeavored to deceive humanity respecting the true character of the Creator; and his success is shown by the warped and twisted interpretations that we all gave to our Heavenly Father’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sheol Sometimes Used Figuratively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In probably three or four texts out of seventy the Hebrew word Sheol and its Greek equivalent Hades are used figuratively, as, for instance, St. Paul refers to Hades, the tomb, under the figure of a monster which has been engorging itself with humanity. He represents it figuratively as yielding to the glorified Messiah at His Second Advent and disgorging its prey in the resurrection. Looking forward to the completion of the resurrection at the close of the Messianic Reign, he exclaims, “O Death, where is thy sting? O Hades, where is thy victory?” Similarly the Prophet David likened the tomb to a great monster about to devour him, and likened the pains of his sickness to the teeth of the monster, saying, “The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me. ♦ * * Then called I upon the name of the Lord * * * and He helped me” (Psalm 116:3-6)—the king was raised up from illneSs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Again, the Lord through the Prophet, speaking of the great giant systems of this present time, declares that they will go down into Sheol, into death, and figuratively represents their meeting in death with the great oppressive systems of the past. (Isaiah 14:9-11.) But there is no suggestion of eternal torment connected with the word Sheol anywhere. And the fact that the Lord redeems our souls from Sheol, and will destroy Sheol eventually by raising mankind from the state of death, proves positively the gross error under which we labored in respect to the meaning of this word and its equivalent in the New Testament Greek— Hades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">True, there is a reference to the Second Death, where we read of those who shall be brought to a knowledge of God during Messiah’s Kingdom and who then shall deliberately and intelligently refuse the way of righteousness. We read: “The wicked shall be returned to Sheol, and all the nations that forget God.” (Psalm 9:17.) These are not the ignorant and weak, but the intelligently wicked. They are' not those who have never known God, but those who, after knowing Him, forget Him and willfully choose the way of sin. For such God has no blessing of life everlasting. They “shall be destroyed from amongst the people.”— Acts 3:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the New Testament, the word Gehenna represents the Second Death—the utter destruction of the class consigned to it. As every scholar knows, Gehenna is the Greek form of the Hebrew word Geh-hinnon. It was the name of a valley outside the wall of Jerusalem, long used as a garbage furnace for the destruction of the offal. But it was never recognized by God as a place for torture or sufferings, or for any living creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although the capital punishment of the Divine Law is death, annihilation, God has subordinate punishments, all of which are for reformation, or we might properly say, all of which are designed to be purgatorial, purifying. Amongst the Scriptures referring to these we might include St. Peter’s words, “Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which shall try you”—purify you and test your character, to demonstrate your faithfulness as the people of God and your worthiness of association with Messiah in His glorious Kingdom to be set up at His Second Advent.—1 Peter 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">St. Paul, writing along the same lines, calls these “light afflictions, which are but for a moment,” and designed to “work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.” (2 Corinthians 4:17.) They thus work out blessings for the Church by purifying them as New Creatures, eliminating the dross from the gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Malachi’s prophecy it is foretold that Jesus would institute purgatorial experiences amongst the consecrated people of God, the antitypical Levites. He does this to purify them of dross and to enable those who have offered their lives to God sacrificially, to be acceptable as His members. We read: “He shall sit as a Refiner and Purifier of silver, to purify the sons of Levi, that they may offer unto the Lord an acceptable sacrifice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus has thus been sitting as the Refiner and Purifier of His Church for more than eighteen centuries. The .fires ,of persecution, tribulation, which He has permitted to come upon them are all purgative—designed to purify, to purge, to make them white. His people have the assurance that He will not suffer them to be tempted above that they are able, but will with* every temptation provide a way of escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Whole World Lieth in the Wicked One.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All are “children of wrath,” and still under Divine sentence of condemnation, except the Church of the First-borns— the antitypical Levites, Spirit-begotten. We who have thus been called out from the world have the settlement of our prospects for life everlasting or the Second Death in this Age, before the blessing of the Lord comes to mankind in general. The Church’s trial and purgatorial experiences must all take place during this Age, before the New Age opens, which in the Divine arrangement is provided for the world’s judgment. “God has appointed a Day [the Day of Christ, a thousand years] in the which He will judge the world in righteousness [give to each a fair, full, righteous opportunity for reconciliation] by that Man whom He hath ordained [The Christ, of which Jesus is the Head and His faithful followers the members.]”—Acts 17:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The World's Purgatory Future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Church of Christ constitutes the-Elect, the Spiritual Seed of Abraham, through which all the families of the-earth, the non-ele.ct, are to be blessed,, according to God’s promise. The foundation for the world’s blessing was laid in-the same sacrifice of Jesus by which the-Church’s reconciliation 'was made possible. Nevertheless, the prospects for the-Church and the world are quite different. The Church, through following her Redeemer voluntarily and sacrificially, in-suffering for righteousness’ sake, is to be crowned with glory, honor and immortality beyond the veil, with the spirit nature..</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By this, the glorious resurrections change, the Church will be prepared for association with her Lord in His great work of blessing Adam and his race— regenerating them. A thousand years have been set apart for the work by the great Life-Giver. The life to be given to the willing and obedient of mankind will be earthly life, human life, human perfection, in Paradise restored, world-wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As • purgatorial experiences are wise and proper as respects the Church, similarly fiery trials and chastisements are the Lord’s plan for dealing with mankind for their good. The purgatorial experiences will prevail especially at the beginning of the New Dispensation and will be abated for all who will turn to-Messiah, seek forgiveness and strive to, walk in ways of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And ways of righteousness will them not mean, as now to the Church, self-. sacrifice. Now the Divine rule is that. “He that saveth his life shall lose it”; but then whoever would save his lifemay save it by obedience to the Divinelaws, by abstinence to the extent of his ability, from sin. Such may gradually rise up out of their imperfection, mental, moral and physical, to the grand image of God originally represented in&gt; Father Adam and lost through his disobedience and his sentence of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">True, the world has had its sufferings* all through the past; the whole creation, has groaned and travailed together under the infliction of the sentence of death pronounced against Father Adam and holding fast against all of his posterity. To some extent these have been judgments or punishments for sins; but on the whole we cannot call the world’s experiences during the past six thousand years purgatorial. Purgatorial experiences would be those administered under the eye and care of a great director, and designed to purify.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hot Purgatorial Fires Soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Numerous are the symbolical pictures used in the Scriptures to explain and yet to hide the character of the purgatorial experiences of the world, as they will, begin in an awful time of trouble as soon as the Church shall all have passed beyond the veil by the First Resurrection change. These terrible troubles coming* upon the world are designed of the Lord to purge the world, to bring mankind to a due sense of responsibility, and to. show the desirability of righteousness and the undesirability of sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the Day that I rise up to the prey; for My determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the Kingdoms, to pour upon them Mine indignation, even all My fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of My jealousy.” (Zephaniah 3:8.) Here we have the purgatorial fire with which the New Dispensation will be ushered in. It will be on earth, and not in some unknown place—neither in the interior of the earth, nor beyond the bounds of time and space.” It will be purgatorial in the sense that it will be under the supervision of the Lord, with a view to-bringing a blessing to mankind out of that trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That a bles'' will come out of it is indicated b’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">sentence following, which tells uiat amid the severity of the trouble God will grant grace and mercy and blessing. “Then will I turn unto the people a pure Message, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve Him with one consent.” (Zephaniah 3:9.) Thus we have another evidence that this is purgatorial or symbolical fire or trouble, and not literal fire, otherwise no people would be left </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">whom the pure Message could be given. But God’s intention is that all mankind, living and dead, shall come to a knowledge of the Truth, for Christ Jesus by the grace of God “tasted death for every man.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">DEBTS OF CIVILIZED NATIONS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The below figures show the public ■debts and annual interest charges of the principal nations of the world. These •debts represent chiefly moneys expended for war, war equipments, battleships, ■etc. The amounts continue to pile up year by year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The public scarcely understand the situation; they wonder to whom the amounts are owing and what can be done when pay-day comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The wealthy know that these bonds represent their money and they feel satisfied to get even a small interest with such good security and no trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of late, however, a certain fear is taking hold upon the rich—what if Socialism should gain control? And what if, by and by, the national treasury should go into bankruptcy and repudiate its bonds?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Evidently the world needs just such a good, strong Government and just such wise and just laws as the Kingdom of God’s dear Son will shortly bring to them.

<p><span class="font3">These are all the nations whose public ■debts exceed $500,000,000, but every government on earth has been for years, and suil is, borrowing to cover the deficits that are annually created by spending more money than the revenues will justify. They are compelled to issue bonds in order to make up the difference. It is a serious question how long this extravagance can be continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">DRINKERS BARRED AS RAILROADERS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some time ago one .of the large American railroads announced that in future nobody would be employed in the operating department of the road who was not a total abstainer. Almost as early as railroading itself was the demand on the part of the public that the driver ■ and conductor should not be intoxicated while on duty, and public opinion eventually succeeded in making it a misdemeanor for an employe concerned in the •operating of trains to drink while on duty. There reform stopped. It ‘was assumed that what a man did in his ■own time was his own business, and that if he chose to drink he had as much right to do so as any one else. Now the railroads are realizing that what a man does in his own time may be his own business, but that it may have a decided effect upon what a man does when he is at work. For example, a driver who “made a night of it” may be sober when &gt;4ie turns up for duty next morning, but 'he is not in the condition he should be un for the safe operation of a train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the Editor of the Tribune:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sib: Last Sunday night the International Bible Students Association, of Brooklyn, N. Y., held a meeting at the Town Hall, and the speaker delivered a lecture on the subject of “Why God Permits Evil.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">S.</span><span class="font3"> went there to find out why he could stell me what I could imagine for myself, and I will acknowledge that his explanation of the subject was something I never dreamed of. It was the most interesting lecture I have heard for a long time on Bible history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Next Sunday night at 7:30 o’clock there will be another meeting, which I would like to ask all our friends to come around £@, ^specially the “Presbyterian Men’s Bible Class.” You will hear something sthat will do you good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">WILLIAM BOYD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">'Extract from “The North Philadelphia Tribune,” issue of Saturday, August 3, 1912. Paper issued at Bridesburg, Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from 1st page, 4th column.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The trouble which will follow the gathering of the Church to the heavenly plane, by the First Resurrection, is symbolically represented as the melting of the earth (society) with the fervent heat (strife, contention, discord) of that time. Already we see the Capitalistic element and the Socialistic element and the Labor element preparing for the contest which is to constitute the great “time of trouble such as never was” before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not only so, but the “heavens” also will take fire and pass away with a great noise. These are Scripturally shown to be the symbolical heavens, the ecclesiastical heavens. Thus the intimation of the prophecy is that the social strife will extend to and include, not only social, political and financial conditions, but also include Ecclesiasticism. The fiery trouble of anarchy will consume everything of the present, and make way for the New Dispensation, of which St. Peter tells us. In the same symbolical language he calls the New Dispensation a “new heavens and a new earth.” The “new heavens” will be the Church in glory. The “new earth” will be the new social order of things established by that Heavenly Kingdom—a reign of righteousness, justice, leading bn to a reign of love.—2 Peter 3:10-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This great purgatorial experience at the inauguration of the New Dispensation is again Scripturally likened to a “fire.”- As we read: “The proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the Day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITH-SALVATION AND WORKS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“By grace are ye saved through faith; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God.”—Tto&gt;ii</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THE relationship between faith and <sup>4</sup> works in the matter of the Church’s salvation has been a question of controversy for centuries. However, this, like other subjects once mysterious, yields to the clearer light of our-day. Now we perceive the importance of both faith and works and the relationship they bear to each other. Faith is the all-important factor in God’s sight, because in our fallen condition we cannot do perfect works and because God cannot consistently accept and reward any but perfect works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s arrangement for us, therefore, in Christ, is that He will judge us, not according to our works, but according to our faith. Nevertheless, good works are recognized as a demonstration of our faith. So surely as we have the proper faith in God and His promises it will' manifest itself in works, even though we cannot do perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So St. James points out that Abraham was not justified without works, but was required to demonstrate his faith by his works, even though they were not perfect works and could not have justified him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Age of Faith—Age of Works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If we call this Gospel Age the Age of Faith, none should misunderstand us to mean that works are now wholly ignored, but rather that works take the secondary place. Likewise, when we say that the coming Age of the Messianic Kingdom will be an Age of Works, none should understand us as meaning that faith will then be ignored. Works will then be the basis of the Lord’s judgment in dealing with the world. Thus we read that they shall be “judged every man according to his works.” (Revelation 22:12.) Judgment according to works, yet not without faith, may perhaps appeal to some of our minds as being the more reasonable, the more just form of judgment. However, when we come to note the difference between the conditions of the trial of the Church of this Age and the future trial of the world during the Messianic Reign, we can see readily the reason for the different basis of judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Present Grace Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the present time the Lord is selecting from the world a special class to be the Bride of Christ, and He properly makes Faith the test. (1) Because in the Divine estimation faith in God is one of the grandest elements of character, the one most essential to such as will be entrusted with high positions and authority in the Kingdom. (2) Because the judgment according to faith meets the various conditions of the present time as a judgment according to works would not do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Do You Believe in the Resurrection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Most Precious Text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our Lord’s Return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Which Is the True Gospel?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">it shall leave them neither root nor branch.”—Malachi 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the fires of that time will be fires of righteousness, consuming the things of pride, sin and iniquity. They will burn as long as there is anything sinful to consume. As quickly as pride is abandoned, as quickly as evil-doing is abandoned, so quickly will the fires cease. But the Prophet declares that those purgatorial fires will be thorough-going. They will leave neither root nor branch of pride and wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The intimation in thisris that the fire soon to begin may in individual cases burn on and on—perhaps in the cases of some individuals for a century, for the declaration is that all will be smitten down in the Second Death who shall fail to make some progress towards righteousness during the first hundred years of purgatorial and disciplinary experiences. The sinner a hundred years old shall be cut off.—Isaiah 65:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We also note the great distinction between the sufferings of this present time and those of the future. The Church suffers from the Adversary and his misguided servants; and the. Lord merely supervises, that these sufferings shall not be too severe nor beyond our power of endurance. But the purgatorial experiences of the future will be along reverse lines. Only evil-doers will suffer, and all the chastisements will be meted out by the great Redeemer with a view to purging mankind from sin and selfishness and preparing them by Restitution for the Heavenly Father’s everlasting blessing—eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">that not of yourselves: it is the gift of </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">esians</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2 :8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ing that if they had perfect bodies as Jesus’ body was perfect, they would be perfect in works as well as in faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the next Age, the Divine Plan will not be the selection of self-sacrificing ones for the Kingdom, but the blessing of humanity with an opportunity to return to the full perfection of human nature. They will be required merely to demonstrate their loyalty to God in the use of their lives faithfully in obedience to His Law. The reward for the sacrifices of this Age is to be glory, honor and immortality, the Divine nature and joint-heirship with the Lord Jesus in His Kingdom. The reward for obedience to be given in the next Age will be human perfection in the image and likeness of God, with all the earthly inheritance originally given to Adam—lost through, sin and redeemed by the merit of Christ’s sacrifice. And since the objective points of the two Ages are different, so will be their methods and conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have already considered the conditions of the Church’s trial; let us next notice how different will be the conditions of the world’s trial, according to works, in the coming Age. The reign of Satan and sin now prevalent is to give way; Satan is to be bound for a thousand years that he may deceive the nations no more for that period. The darkness, ignorance, superstition and misunderstanding of God and His plans, etc., which have prevailed for the last six thousand years will pass away. Instead, “the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His beams.” The darkness of ignorance, superstition, etc., which at the present time covers the earth, and gross darkness the heathen, makes faith in the present time a very precious thing indeed which only comparatively few can or will exercise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But, when the shadovs and darkness shall flee away, when the True Light shall shine, when “the knowledge of the glory of the Lord shall fill the whole earth as the waters cover the great deep”—then faith will not be at its present premium because it will then be very easy to exercise faith. Moreover, while perfect works are impossible now, because of our imperfections of the flesh, perfect works will gradually become possible to the world in the next Age, because as they progress in the light and in obedience to the laws of that Kingdom they will gradually be recovering the perfection of the flesh, mental, moral and physical. And as they recover these powers correspondingly more and better works will be required each year, each century, of their experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally, before the glorious Epoch shall conclude—before Messiah shall turn over the Kingdom to the Father—all the willing and obedient will have come to full perfection and hence to full capacity for perfect works and God will demand them; they will therefore be the standard or test in the world’s trial Day—“They shall be judged every man, according to his works.” In both these Judgments we see Justice and Mercy harmoniously working together in the interests of those on trial, the differences between the two operations being such merely as adapt them to the conditions of the individuals on trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Come Now to Our Text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A glance at our text shows that it relates to the present Age and not to the period of Messiah’s Kingdom. The Apostle is addressing those called to joint-heirship in the Kingdom, of whom he says in the context that “God in mercy hath quickened us with Christ and raised us up together to a heavenly station in Christ Jesus, that in the Ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.” Without question these words apply to the Elect Church, and with equal certainty they cannot properly be, applied to the nonelect world, whose opportunity for blessing belongs to the next Age and will come to them from the Father, through the Son, by the Church in glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our text contains another statement which has been the cause of much dispute, namely, the one which declares that “we are saved by grace through faith, a^d that not of ourselves, it is the gift of God.” It is easy to understand the forepart of this statement, that we are saved by grace, and easy also to' understand the last part, namely, that we are not saved by works and that, therefore, none of us have any ground for boasting in our salvation. “By nature we were children of wrath, even as others.” We were under the sentence of death and could not recover ourselves from that condition. Whatever, therefore, should be done for us to help us out of our condemnation and fallen condition would necessarily be of grace, and also of God. Now we come to the more difficult part of our text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“That Not of Yourselves.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">chines, reacting as acted upon. This</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">How shall we understand the suggestion that the faith is not of ourselves but is the gift of .God? Surely God does not exercise faith for us, and surely also He does not develop the faith in us by some miraculous power, for in either of these cases the saints would be merely mawould neither develop nor prove character, nor in any wise fit and prepare us for the glorious work to which we have been called. How is it God’s gift?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is one view of this statement which we believe clears it of all mystery and ' makes it entirely harmonious with Divine Justice and our responsibility. It is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Faith is possible only where there is a basis of knowledge; in proportion, therefore, as God grants us knowledge of Himself and of His great Plan, in that proportion is it possible for us to exercise faith in that Plan, and by our endeavors to demonstrate the strength and sincerity of our faith. While it is true that our knowledge depends in large measure upon our application in the study of the Divine Word—upon our use of the means and opportunities placed within our reach by a kind Providence— nevertheless there are millions of our<sub>r </sub>race who have had no opportunity what-■ ever-for-knowledge? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For instance, during the more than four thousand years from Adam to the days of Jesus, knowledge and opportunity for faith were very limited. For more than two thousand years God made no direct revelation whatever of His good intentions in respect to sending a Saviour and the delivery of our race from the bondage of sin and death. Then the Message sent was semi-private. To Abraham God declared His intention of blessing the world eventually, and further that this blessing would come through Abraham’s posterity. But what did the masses of mankind at that time know of that promise? Faith in that promise was counted to Abraham for righteousness; and the same with Isaac and Jacob. Ultimately the promise descended to the nation of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally, Jesus came, and that which had been promised began to have an actuality, a fulfilment. Yet even then the thing offered was so different from that which the Israelites had for centuries expected, that the majority of them wholly failed to exercise the necessary faith and to enter into the privileges of the hour—membership in Spiritual Israel as sons of God begotten to a higher nature. So, says the Apostle, “Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for, but the Election obtained it and the rest were blinded.” Only the few had a sufficiency of faith to make use of their knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“If Our Gospel Be Hid.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">St. Paul declares that the Gospel is hidden from some during this Age, namely, from the perishing ones whom Satan hath blinded, and these surely are the vast majority -of the race. As Jesus declared to His disciples, “Blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear.” And thus it has been all down the Age for more than eighteen centuries. Only the few have been so .highly favored by birth and environment, etc., as to be able to see and able to hear and appreciate the . glorious invitation of this present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Furthermore, God’s providence has been exercising apparently a discrimination in the sending of the Gospel Message. It went not alike to all parts f the earth. Beginning' with Israel in Palestine it moved northward and westward to Greece and to Italy, and thus spread through and amongst the savage tribes of Europe, namely, to such as had “ears to hear” the Divine call to jointheirship with Christ in the glorious Kingdom soon to be established. From Europe this Message, this knowledge, came to America; and now, within the last century in particular, it is reaching some of the many millions of India, China,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">Japan, Africa, etc., but still with the same limitations. It appeals only to a comparatively few in any nation—“He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">of the Bible contain the spiritual food upon which we as New Creatures must feed in order to grow up to the required likeness of Christ—in order to be fitted</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>

<p><span class="font3">We say that these are works worthy</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">* “Not of Yourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ah, yes, we can see a force in the Apostle’s words, “not of yourselves.” It is indeed for -urselves to exercise faith when the knowledge comes to us, yet faith being impossible without knowledge, we were dependent upon God for it. How thankful we should be, how appreciative! How sympathetic we should be toward those who have not been so highly favored with knowledge or whose condition has been less favorable to the cultivation of the hearing ear and of the understanding heart! Truly God is electing and selecting, testing and proving the members of the Church of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another phase of the subject well worthy of our notice is that our faith is largely a matter of development; first the seed, then the blade, then the ear, then the ripe corn. When God gave us the first impulse toward a knowledge of Himself and of His purposes, that was the seed from which faith might germinate if it fell into a heart or mind that was good soil for it. And even those whose hearts are good soil for the Message of God’s grace and the Kingdom invitation find that they greatly need a certain Divine supervision, watch-care, in order to bring forth fruitage such- as the Lord will be pleased to accept. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What would any of us be today without the grace of God assisting us in faith and in obedience? Surely the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">and prepared in character-and-faith-de-velopment for a place in the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It should not surprise us, therefore, to find the Scriptures clearly teaching that the Bible contains nourishments exactly adapted to our requirements. St. Paul illustrates this matter by saying that in the beginning of our experiences we, as new-born babes, should “desire the sincere milk of the Word that we might .grow thereby”—grow in grace and in knowledge and faith and obedience. But he admonishes us also that we should not always continue to be babes, feeding upon</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">the milk of the Word, but that by use of it and the strength that is rived we should become strong in Lord, become manly, attaining unto</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">the de-the the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">full stature of manliness as members of the Body of Christ. And for this additional strength the Apostle tells us that we need more than the milk of the Word —we need the “strong meat” of God’s Word, of God’s promises, that we may</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">grow thereby. And again, in all finding and using of the “meat in season” we are indebted to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not only has He provided meat in season in the Holy Scriptures, “that</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">this due</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">faith would long since have and died. We must still say, grace of God we are saved, faith, not of ourselves. It is</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">man of God may be thoroughly furnished” and able to “rightly divide the Word of Truth,” but additionally He has granted help amongst the brethren, that we may build one another up in the faith, until we all come to the full stature in Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">_ How evident then it is that our salvation through faith is not a matter of an instantaneous injection of faith into us in some miraculous manner, but a gradual</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">of a Creator, and we are surprised that the Great Eternal should in any sense cf the word interest Himself and His great Power in a transforming work in connection with our hearts and lives. Nevertheless, the more we consider it the more we are convinced that the creation of angels was a greater display of Divine Power than the creation of the worlds. Likewise the creation of man in the image of God was a far greater creation than that of the material Universe, because man was created in the image and likeness of His Creator—Adam was a miniature copy of God in the flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Divine intention respecting Adam and his race in general, the Bible assures us, is Restitution—restoration eventually to all that was enjoyed by our first parents in Eden, and lost through disobedience—sin. The Heavenly Father has arranged that the sorrows and tears incidental to the reign of sin and death are Hot to be in vain. He purposed man’s redemption and restoration from before the foundation of the world—foreknowing as He did the course of Adam as a free agent, his disobedience and fall under the death penalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus the Scriptures assure us that in the Divine purpose Jesus was “the Lamb slain from before the foundation of the<sup>-</sup>world.” And they assure us that the Lamb who was slain is ultimately to be given the dominion over the whole earth, and for a thousand years shall exercise a reign of righteousness, justice, love and power with a view to the reclamation and restitution of all the willing and obedient of the human family—and the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">“Ye See Your Calling, Brethren.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">St. Paul, pointing out the privileges of those who are now being called, says, “Ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called,” but chiefly “the poor of this #orld, rich&quot; in faith, heirs of the Kingdom.” (1 Corinthians 1:26; James 2:5.)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">Those who possess the blessings of present life in great abundance* thereby disadvantaged respecting great High Calling, while the poor of world have their compensation, for</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">things of the present time having less attraction for them, their ears and hearts and “the eyes of their understanding” are more ready to discern the glorious things of the Divine revelation, which the natural eye hath not seen nor the ear heard—things which God hath in reservation for those that love Him—supremely —for those whose love for God manifests itself in a full consecration of mind and body to know and to do the Divine will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our text tells us of the possibilities of our “calling”—of what God through Christ is able and willing to do for us— even bringing us to a perfection of holiness and faultlessness in the Divine presence at the end of our race course. But there are conditions, our text declares, namely: “If ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the Hope of the Gospel, which ye have heard and which was preached</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">to every creature heaven.”—Verse 23.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">which was under</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">the result of the knowledge granted and the Divine blessing poured upon us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Growing in Grace, Etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In full line with what we have considered is the Apostolic injunction that we must continue to grow in grace and in knowledge and in faith and in love, and to the extent of our ability in obedience and good works. And this growth in grace, this growth in faith, signifies a continued and further growth in knowledge. For instance, the promises</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">development, as we have seen; and .destruction of all those who love sin and how evident it &quot;is that in the development hate righteousness and who therefore are</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">of this faith we are to be co-workers together with God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let us, therefore, be very appreciative of the great privileges granted to us and use them wisely, lest we should receive the grace of God in vain and miss this great Prize which has been offered to us and which we have accepted and which God will be faithful to give to those who faithfully use the blessings of His provision.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">here reiterate the fact that before anything could be done by way of reconciling sinners to God a sacrificial work was necessary. The great Creator’s sentence ■of death upon the race could neither be ignored by Himself nor by any other. No reconciliation to God could possibly be accomplished which would bring the sinner back into full fellowship and the enjoyment of Divine favor and everlasting life except as the penalty for original sin should first be met. So the Apostle reminds us that the One who is able to present us holy and blameless and unreprovable is He who has already made reconciliation for us “in the body of His flesh through death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let us pause here long enough to impress upon our minds this great Biblical fact, that it was the death of Jesus which secures for Father Adam (and incidentally for all of his race condemned in him) a release from the death sentence which came upon him as a violator of the Divine Law. And let us not forget that there is, an infinite difference between a death sentence which God did inflict and an eternal torment sentence which the</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">nounced against<sup>7</sup> the sinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was because t-he sentence, “Dying,, thou shalt die,” was pronounced against Father Adam that the death of Jesus was a Ransom-price sufficient to secure the sinner’s release—and the release from death by a resurrection of all of Adam’s posterity who shared the results of his sentence. Thus we see the force of the Scriptural declaration that “as by a man came death, by a Man also came the resurrection from the dead; for as all in Adam die, even so all in Christ shall be made alive—every man in his own order.” —1 Corinthians 15:21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But the Father’s grace operating in Christ Jesus designs more' than merely the abolishment of the death sentence. To merely redeem us and merely bring us back into the condition in which death overtook us is not the Divine Program. It is further reaching; it aims at our complete uplift out of sin, as well as out of death, its penalty—out of weakness and out of imperfection of every kind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Restitution which belongs to the coming Age of Messiah’s glorious reign of righteousness. On the contrary, it deals with the specially favored and specially blessed ones who during this Age are being called, proved, tested, polished, prepared for joint-heirship with Jesus in His Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These are special objects of Divine care, whose blessing consists not in restitution to earthly perfection and an earthly Eden home or Paradise. These are called of God with a “high calling,” a “heavenly calling”—to be “heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 8:17.) These, St. Peter tells us, have been granted exceeding great and precious promises, that by these promises [as the Divine power </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font3">energy working in them] they might become partakers of the Divine nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ah, now we perceive the special sense in which Divine Power is being exercised toward the called and elect Church from that which will be exercised toward the world in general. God is creating a new order of beings in the Universe—an order or class on the Divine plane, which is far above that of angels, principalities and powers or any other plane in the whole Universe. This is the sense, then, in which we are God’s workmanship and newly created of Him in Christ Jesus</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font3">understanding respecting the degree of righteousness. The result is not to be merely a righteous will, or a righteous purpose, with an imperfection of accomplishment, but so thorough a work that when it is finished we will be faultless and unreprovable, not only in the sight of our Redeemer, but also in the sight of our Heavenly Father. Ah, no wonder if we are astonished at the wonderful power and grace of God which this declaration reveals!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ye Are God’s Workmanship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The same inspired pen explains elsewhere to us: “Ye are God’s husbandry,” ye are God’s workmanship. (1 Corinthians 3:9). Let us not lose sight of the thought that “it is God that worketh in us, both to will and to do of His good pleasure.” (Philippians 2:13.) While the Lord Jesus Christ, as our Elder Brother and the Captain of our Salvation and the active Agent in our redemption through His death, is associated with the Father in all of this work of our perfecting, nevertheless we are not to lose sight of the fact that all things are of the Father, as all things are by the Son. The two are in perfect accord, but the Scriptures assure us that the Plan itself was the Father’s and that He graciously invited the Son to the participation which He enjoys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When we think of the Divine creative Power our minds go out to the wheeling orbs which encircle our earth, to the millions of suns and hundreds of millions of planets which fill the space about us and which we call the Universe: “Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showbth knowledge; there is no speech nor language where their voice is</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“The Hope of th? Gcapel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It should not surprise us that the Apostle lays great stress upon the “Hope of the Gospel.” God is not working in us with tools of iron and steel or gold or silver to transform or to polish us. His fashioning and transforming tool is the Hope of the Gospel. It is this Hope which the Apostle declares we should “have as an anchor to our soul, both sure and steadfast, entering into that which is within the veil, whither our Forerunner is for us entered.” (Hebrews 6:19, 20.) Thus we will be settled and grounded and safe in all the storms </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">life, great and small. Our anchorage of faith will give us the assurance of the Divine promise, that “all things shall work together for good to those who are the calle.d according to His purpose,” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">those who are the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Happy objects of His grace, Destined to behold His face.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But the Divine arrangement is that in order to continue in the faith we must feed continually upon the promises of God, and must allow them to have </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">sanctifying power in our minds, in our hearts and over our words and conduct, making us more and more copies of God’s dear Son. As our text intimates and other Scriptures tell us, the Adversary will seek to move us away from the glorious promises of the Gospel, putting fear as an incentive ’instead of love, or attracting us by worldly pleasures or pride or “the love of money,” which is “a root of all evil.” Our worthiness to</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">cerned. The Father’s providences guided that Jesus should first pass through the trials and difficulties and self-sacrifices necessary to a demonstration of His loyalty, which would prove Him worthy of the Divine nature. And so the Apostle tells us that He who was rich, for our sakes became poor; that the Logos humbled Himself and took a bondman’s form in harmony with the Divine program. “And being found in fashion a Man, He humbled Himself” still further, even to death, “even the death of the cross.” “Wherefore also [on this account] God hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name that is above every name, that at the -name of Jesus every knee should bow, both of things in heaven and things on the earth.”—Philippians 2:6-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nor did the New Creation cease with this exaltation of the Logos, the Redeemer of men, to the Father’s right hand of power and honor and glory, that “all men should honor the Son even as they honor the Father.” (John 5:23.) On the contrary, St. Paul explains to us a Mystery, hidden from previous Ages and Dispensations, but now made known unto God’s saintly, namely, that the Divine, purpose is that a Church class shall be selected during this Gospel Age, to share with the Logos, Jesus, His exalted glory and honor, dominion and power and Di-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">If we know these things, happy will we be if we allow them to exercise us both to will and to do the Father’s good pleasure, to the extent of our ability as New Creatures in Christ. If we do so, He who began the good work will complete it in the Day of the Lord Jesus Christ—in the Morning of the New Dispensation—in the First Resurrection. This means a gradual growing in grace and in knowledge and in the fruits and graces of the Holy Spirit to the extent of our ability The merit of our Redeemer compensating for all our unintentional shortcomings. He will eventually present us holy, faultless, unreprovable in the Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PULPIT </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HAS DOST POWER.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">44*t»HE Rev. Lyman Abbott, of New </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font2">York, spoke sadly of the deca</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">dence </span><span class="font2">of the power of the pulpit, addressing- 3,000 University of Wisconsin men and women at a convention at Madison, Wis. ‘It is said the cloth has lost its power—it has,’ said Di. Abbott. ‘It is said the pulpit has lost its power—it has. But a man, altruistic </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font2">the highest sense and spiritual, will never lose his power.’ ” * * </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">*—Press Report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was certainly appropriate that Dr. Abbott should make the above statement to college people. Admitting the tacts, let us find also their cause. It </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font2">because of the inconsistency of its teaching that the pulpit has lost its power with the masses. The pulpit backs up and endorses the teachings </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">all the colleges of our day along </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">lines of Higher Criticism and Evolution. The people are coming to understand that this means that the pulpit is in antagonism to the Bible. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font2">Evolution be true, man never fell </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">hence needed no Redeemer and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font2">saving from a fallen state, but needed merely to be let alone in his evolutionary progress. According to Higher Criticism the Bible in general </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font2">unreliable. Moses never wrote the books accredited to him, and Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel and others never wrote the books accredited to them—■ never were inspired of God to write these books. And if this be true, then Jesus and the Apostles were deceived and could not have been inspired by God when they quoted from these sacred writings of the past and declared them to be the Word of God and vouched for their authorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">No Wonder Church Attendance Is Slim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the other hand the public notice </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font2">the very ministers who thus preach Evolution, Higher Criticism, unbelief in the Divine Revelation, keep right along preaching some of the absurdities which our forefathers claim</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font2">were in harmony with the Bible. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Is </span><span class="font2">it any wonder that the people are coming to see the inconsistency of such a position?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The result is that the masses have </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">less </span><span class="font2">and less confidence in the clergy. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font2">people do not know what the clergy believe even when they hear them speak, for their address may.be from the standpoint of the creeds or </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">from the </span><span class="font2">standpoint of Higher Criticism, according to their moods. The result of this uncertain sounding of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">trumpet is that the masses are </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">coming </span><span class="font2">to the conclusion that the whole matter of religion is a big guess </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">that some of the guesses are influenced by temporal considerations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The unbelief of the people grows and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">threatens </span><span class="font2">to become agnosticism, or Worse, atheism! Those who have </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">brought </span><span class="font2">about this condition of things during the past thirty years are the college professors and the best educated pulpiteers of Christendom. And </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">now </span><span class="font2">they stand astonished at the re</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">sults, </span><span class="font2">which they should have fore</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">seen. </span><span class="font2">Verily they are fulfilling the Divine prophecies of Isaiah, which, referring to our day, declare, “The wisdom of their wise men shall perish; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">understanding of their prudent men shall not be manifest.” (Isa. 29:14.) No wonder the civilized world is in trepidation as it sees the onward march </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">Socialism! And however honest </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">well intentioned many Socialists may be, the result of their effort will spell anarchy and a time of trouble such as the world has never yet seen —a time of trouble, however, predict</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font2">by Daniel the Prophet, whose pre</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">diction </span><span class="font2">was endorsed by Jesus Himself.—Dan. 12: 1; Matt. 24:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">* * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What is the remedy? No remedy can possibly reach the disease! The Bible rightly understood is the balm of Gilead which alone could have helped. But matters have gone so far that comparatively few have sufficient confidence in the Bible to be willing to make a re-examination of it in the light of the Divine Plan of the Ages, which alone shows the harmony of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Word of God, from beginning to end.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font2">HE BOOK OF DANIEL is one of those against which the “Higher Critics” expend special energy, some being inclined to call it a fiction, while others declare it to be a history of the period of Antiochus Epiphanes (over three hundred years after Daniel’s death) and that it was written by some unknown writer who attached Daniel’s name as a disguise. Modern science and the “Higher Critics” are very much opposed to anything in the nature of positive prophecy—anything claiming to be of direct Divine inspiration, and in any sense of the word attempting to foretell the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Book of Daniel is pre-eminently marked with these characteristics and hence it, more than any other book of the Old Testament, has the reprobation of these gentlemen. But the Lord, through the Apostle and the Prophet, forewarned us of these wise men, whose wisdom would become a trap and a snare unto them: “The wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid [obscured].’’—Isa. 29: 14; 1 Cor. 1: 26-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our Lord also pointed out that </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">these things </span><span class="font2">are hidden from the wise and prudent of this world and revealed unto babes—made clear to those who make no boast of wisdom according to the course of this world. (Matt. 11: 25.) How true to facts we find this to be! While many of the great and learned are stumbling into “Higher Criticism” and other forms of infidelity, the Lord’s “little ones”—meek, humble, teachable, learning from the Father’s Word—are being instructed, and are growing in grace and in the knowledge of the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To those who have clearly in mind the presentations and interpretations of Daniel’s prophecies, as presented in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Studies in the Scriptures, </span><span class="font2">there is no need for elaborate arguments to prove that this wonderful Book of Daniel is not a fiction—that it is more wonderful by far than any fiction that could have been written. And to them it will be useless for any to declare it </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">history of events which happened in 167 B. C. and falsely set forth as a prophecy by Daniel; for they see fulfilments past, present and to come, far larger and grander and more wonderful than anything which occurred </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font2">the date named—they see in these fulfilments unmistakable evidence of superhuman intelligence, and that, as Daniel declared, the Most High God therein revealed the secrets of His Plan still future.—Matt. 24: 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Babylon the First Universal Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Daniel was carried captive with Jehoiachim, King of Judah, and many of the nobility of the land of Israel, eighteen years before the final captivity by the Babylonians in the days of Zedekiah, when the land was left desolate, without an inhabitant, and the seventy years of desolation began. Daniel was fourteen years old when carried captive to Babylon, and consequently lived to the extreme age of over one hundred years.—Dan. 1: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Babylon, the capital city of Babylonia, was the richest and most wonderful city in the world in its day. Indeed, at its zenith Babylon was mistress of the then civilized world— the first Universal Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wealth and prosperity are likely to beget luxurious ease and also to excite the cupidity and ambition of enemies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ed his expression of the Lord’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Mes </span><span class="font2">sage. And the King in turn would have felt that, having paid for the information, it should be a smooth, favorable message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And just so it is with some </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font2">Lord’s true servants in Mystic Babylon. They have the opportunity presented to speak the Lord’s Word; yet many of them are handicapped by reason of having received honors </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">robes, and are more or less inclined to hide and cover the message now due to Babylon in this its Laodicean Epoch. They are bound by the “chain of gold around their necks.”—Rev. 3t 14-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The aged Prophet displayed gentleness as well as fearlessness in the delivery of his message. It was stated as kindly as the truth would permit, but the truth was not withheld by reason of fear. Ke recounted to th® King his father’s exaltation to power, and ascribed it not to the god of Babylon, but to the God of Israel. He reminded the King that pride had caused his father’s downfall, resulting in his degradation to bestial conditions for “seven times” (“seven times” corresponding to the seven years, a “time” signifying a year—a lunar year of 360 days.) Applying the Scriptural scale—“a day for a year” (Ezek. 4: 5, 6)—each “time” would represent 360 years, and “seven times” would be 7 x 360 year® or 2520 years of Gentile domination, which period, by most careful calculation,* we understand will end, in October, 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Daniel reminded King Belshazzar that in the end Nebuchadnezzar had acknowledged the God of heaven as the real Ruler amongst men, and he then charged home to the King that instead of profiting by this experience, of which he well knew, he had lifted up his heart to pride, had ignored the only true God, and had even brought what he knew were the sacred vessels </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">Jehovah’s service to profane them in the worship and glorification of idols— “gods of silver, gold, brass, iron, wood and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know.” He pointed out to the King that he had thus dishonored and defied “the God in whose hand [power] thy breath is [the God of all life—Acts 17: 28, 29], and whose are all thy ways [who has full power to control your course].” This true God he had not glorified, but dishonored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Fateful Words on the Wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By thus kindly but plainly showing the King the truth, the Prophet prepared the way for the exposition of the fateful words—</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsln.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Mene” </span><span class="font2">was repeated, probably for the sake of emphasis—“Numbered! Numbered!”—the limit of the time of your dominion has expired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Tekel”—</span><span class="font2">short weight, lacking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Peres” </span><span class="font2">signifies divided, and its plural form, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Upharsln,” </span><span class="font2">gives the thought of broken or crushed into pieces—destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nothing in the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“peres” </span><span class="font2">signifies-Medes and Persians, but the Prophet knew from the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s vision that the Babylonian dominion would be followed by the Medo-Persian kingdom, and he also</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Continued on 2d page, 2d col.)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Accordingly, the Medes and Persians had consolidated, and their army, under Cyrus, for several months had been besieging Babylon, whose citizens, however, felt quite secure behind their immense walls, and amply provisioned for a longer siege than it was supposed any army could enforce. So great was the confidence of the King of Babylon in the strength of his capital that he made a great feast to a thousand of his lords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This feast &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to have been in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the nature of boast of the greatness of Babylon; ana as though to emphasize his power and. to remind his nobles and lords that none of the gods of the surrounding nations had been able to deliver their peoples out of the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar had called for the vessels of gold and silver brought from the Jewish Temple, and these were profaned by drinking therefrom to the honor of Bel, the god of Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Flush of Confidence Changed to Terror.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the midst of the revelry of the feast, the King, his counsellors and lords were astonished to see a part of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a hand writing certain fiery letters </span><span class="font2">upon the wall of the palace. The revelry ceased, a hush of fear came over all; the flush of confidence upon the King’s face gave place to one of terror; he trembled and called for the advice of the wise men to interpret the wonderful message, but they were unable to explain the matter satisfactorily. The King was greatly disappointed; but his mother came to his assistance, informing him of Daniel, who had given to his father, Nebuchadnezzar, an interpretation of a dream, when all the wise men of Babylon had failed; and accordingly Daniel was sent for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The aged Prophet, at this time about ninety years old, as an officer of the kingdom, doubtless resided in one of the palace buildings near by, and in response to the King’s command he stood before him. The King, realizing the importance of the message, manifested his anxiety by offering—first to the astrologers, and now to Daniel— a great reward for the interpretation— to be robed in royal purple, with a royal, golden chain as insignia of rank, and to be third in dignity and power in the Empire. The first thing in the account which strikes us is the nobility of God’s servant in renouncing all claim to these gifts as a reward for the service of interpreting God’s message—“Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the King, and make known the interpretation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Lesson to Be Learned From Daniel’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We may stop here long enough to take a valuable lesson, to the effect that all who would be the mouthpieces of the Lord, and speak forth His Word, should, like Daniel, do so without stipulation of compensation. Only from this standpoint can any hope to be entirely free and untrammeled in speaking words of truth and soberness, which may be very distasteful to those who inquire the mind of the Lord. Had Daniel thanked the King for the promised gifts, and thus accepted them as a reward for his service, he would have felt obligated to the King to such an extent that it might have warped his judgment, or have weaken</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“We are losing all our secrets in this shabby age,” an architect said. ‘If we keep on the time will come when we’ll be able to do nothing well.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FERTILITY OF PALESTINE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Prof. Richard Gottheil, of Columbia University, the Director of the American School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, believes that the time will soon come when Palestine will be in fact what the Hebrew Scriptures say it was at one time—“a land flowing with milk and honey.” The professor ■admits that changes will have to come before the ideal is realized, but he be-Jeves that the changes will come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When a friend suggested that there would have to be a change in the soil, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font2">well as in the government, he replied that appearances were often deceitful, in Turkey as well as America, and that what appeared to be rock on the hillsides of Judea was really a fertilizer in rock form. Prof. Gottheil is a truthful man, but a truthful man is sometimes called upon to explain statements which seem contrary to facts, and this is the explanation he made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The soil of Palestine is peculiar. It is remarkably fertile, as the primitive methods of cultivation show. If so much can grow as does grow with the mere scratching which the ground receives, how much might be produced if western methods were employed? I have seen trees growing where there was absolutely no dirt visible, but in some way the roots had reached the soil and they had obtained a foothold, which enables them to grow and bear fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Predicts Great Future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“But what is more remarkable still is the fact that there is in the rocks which one sees on these hillsides, chemical properties which correspond with those ingredients in the best fertilizers, and these rocks decompose from time to time, so that what seems so forbidding from an agricultural point of view is really going back into the soil as manure. There is an institution in Jerusalem, founded to give work to poor Hebrews, whose manager actually pounds up the soil, not waiting for it to decompose, and he produces very fine crops as a result of this mixture. Several cases might be cited where hillsides may be made to bear, not exactly forests, but a sufficient number of trees to prove my contention that a great future awaits this country, when conditions now prevalent are changed; and they </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">will be </span><span class="font2">changed; a new spirit is in the air, ■*,nd in the government as well.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">(Continued from page 1.) knew that the Medes and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Persians </span><span class="font2">were already besieging the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So far from being offended with the plain words of the Prophet, Belshazzar seems to have felt their truth, and gave command that the honors already promised should be bestowed upon Daniel. But meantime other matters were transpiring in his capital, of which the King and his lords were unaware, so that the fulfilment of the doom written upon the palace wall was close at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While the Babylonians were feasting' and reveling in fancied security, Cyrus, the general of the united forces of the Medes and Persians, having studied up a plan of attack, had already caused a great ditch to be dug above the city, to divert the waters of the River Euphrates into a new channel. This river flowed through the center of Babylon diagonally, and was protected by enormous gates of brass, which were supposed to be equally impregnable as the three-hundred-foot wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Correspondencies Between Fall of Literal Babylon and That of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Mystic Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Indeed, it would appear that the Babylonians had never a fear of attack from the river, and had left it comparatively unguarded. Consequently, when Cyrus had diverted the stream into the new channel he found little difficulty in marching his troops under the brass gates into the city, so that at the very time the revelry was progressing in Belshazzar’s palace the soldiers of Cyrus were taking possession of the entire city, and very shortly after Daniel’s interpretation of the writing the trcops reached the palace, Belshazzer was slain, and the new empire of Medo-Persia was inaugurated—“without fighting,” as the tablets declare. Thus did Babylon fall suddenly—“in one hour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The thoughtful Bible student must of necessity have always in view the many </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">correspondencies </span><span class="font2">which the Scriptures institute between Literal Babylon and Mystic Babylon, and when he is studying the account of the fall of Literal Babylon his attention is naturally drawn also to the foretold fall of Mystic Babylon, in the end of this Age. Indeed, he must be comparatively blind who cannot see that the wonderful prophecies which speak of the fall of Babylon were not wholly fulfilled by Cyrus the Persian. The fall of literal Babylon, while it was sudden, and while it made a great commotion amongst the nations, lacks much of filling to the full the prophetic picture. Much of these prophecies still wait for fulfilment in Mystic or Symbolic Babylon today; and this fact is abundantly supported by the prophecies of the Book of Revelation, written centuries after the fall of Literal Babylon, which unmistakably refer to Mystic Babylon, and use language almost identical with that of Jeremiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We request that at your convenience you read Isaiah 13: 1-19, in confirmation of what we have said. We recommend further that you compare Jeremiah 50: 15, 29 with Revelation 18: 6; and Jeremiah 50: 38 with Revelation 16: 12; and the 46th verse of Jeremiah 50 with Revelation 18: 9. Compare also Jeremiah 51: 6-9 with Revelation 18: 4-6; and verse 13 of Jeremiah 51 with Revelation 17: 1-15; and verses 37, 63, 64 of Jeremiah 51 with Revelation 18: 2, 4, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It will be noticed, further, that, as Literal Babylon sat upon the literal River Euphrates, so Mystic Babylon is said to sit upon the waters [peoples]. It should be noticed, also, that as the literal city was captured by the diversion of the literal waters, so Symbolic Babylon is to fall by reason of the diversion of the symbolic Euphrates, which in Rev. 16: 12, it is foretold, shall be “dried up—that the way of the Kings of the East might be prepared.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font2">Kings of the East, or Kings from the sunrising (R. V.), are, we understand, the Kings of Christ’s Kingdom, who are also Priests—the Body of Christ, the Royal Priesthood: &quot;Thou hast made them unto our God kings and priests, and they shall reign on the earth.” (Rev. 5: 10.) From this standpoint of view, Cyrus with his army, overthrowing Literal Babylon, was a figure or illustration of Messiah, King of kings and Lord of lords, who with His faithful will shortly overthrow Mystic Babylon, and take possession of the world in the name of Jehovah, to establish the Kingdom for which He taught us to pray, “Our Father; . . . Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Cyrus a Type of the Conquering Christ and His Message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This likeness of Cyrus to Messiah is not merely in the particulars noted. It should be remembered that the name Cyrus signifies “the sun,” and that thus in his name he reminds us of the prophecy of Christ—“The Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His beams.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“WHERE ARE THE DEAD?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This article was published in this paper in Volume one, Number 3. The interest aroused, and the great demand for copies of it have been remarkable. A sample copy will be mailed to any one free. Address, Bible Society, 17 Hicks Street, Brooklyn.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Moreover, there were sundry very </span><span class="font2">remarkable prophecies respecting Cyrus, made long before he had come into prominence. Through the Prophet Isaiah (44: 28) the Lord speaks of Cyrus as His shepherd, who would lead back Israel; and again (45: 1-4), He calls him His Anointed, saying, “Thus saith the Lord to His Anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two-leaved gates, and the gates shall not be shut; I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sunder the bars of iron; and I will give thee the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places, tLat thou mayest know that I, Jehovah, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel. For Jacob My servant’s sake, and Israel Mine elect, I have even called thee by name; I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known Me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this prophecy Cyrus is evidently indicated, and yet just as evidently a greater than he is indirectly referred to, viz., the Prince of the kings of the east, who in Revelation is shown as drying up the symbolic Euphrates and destroying Symbolic Babylon, and delivering Spiritual Israel. And the time for the fulfilment of the symbol is clearly indicated, by the drying up of the Euphrates, under the sixth vial of the “Day of Wrath;” and the fall of Babylon, under the seventh vial, resulting in the liberty of all of God’s people from the thraldom, through false doctrine, which has been upon them for lo, these many years, is portrayed as resulting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Babylon literal fell because, when tried in the balances by the Lord, she was found wanting; Mystic Babylon falls for a similar reason. Literal Babylon never was Israel, but the Israelites were for a time swallowed up in Babylon; likewise, Mystic Babylon never was Spiritual Israel, though for a long time Spiritual Israel has been in captivity to Mystic Babylon. As the same Cyrus who overthrew literal Babylon made the proclamation which permitted literal Israel to return from captivity, so it is the King of kings who, upon taking His great power as earth’s new King, will set free all of the Lord’s people—and in advance He sends the message to those who have ears to hear, saying, &quot;Babylon the Great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation ®f demons and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.... Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.”—Rev. 18: 2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Babylon’s Feast Foreshadows Short-Lived Joy That Will Follow Church Federation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The great feast wiLjh preceded the fall of Babylon would seem to correspond well with the great denominational Union expected soon [Church Federation], and the correspondingly short season of rejoicing which will accompany it. The gold and silver vessels of the Lord’s house which were profaned may fitly represent, not only the precious truths of Divine revelation, but also the Lord’s consecrated people—the golden vessels representing the “little flock,” and the more numerous silver vessels representing the “great company.” What may be the character of the defilement and injury of these antitypical vessels is, of course, problematical, but in any case we remember that those consecrated vessels in the type were all highly honored and restored to the temple by Cyrus, and likewise we know that not only the truths of Divine revelation will all be cared for by our Lord, but also that all who are His shall be glorifiea in the Spiritual Temple which He will shortly rear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No one can make these comparisons, we believe, and not feel fully convinced that the Holy Spirit, dictating through Isaiah and Jeremiah, was the same Holy Spirit which guided St. John through the Apocalyptic vision. Nor can such students escape the conclusion that the force of the prophecies applies specially to Mystic Babylon, rather than to the literal city and country. As one section of Literal Babylon fell before another, so Revelation predicts it will be with Mystic Babylon. As Literal Babylon ruled over the whole world, so Mystic Babylon is represented as ruling the civilized world, and hence the entire world. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Mystic Babylon Shall Be Cast Into the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Sea to Rise No More.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As the lords of Babylon were made drunk by wine which they drank from the golden vessels captured from the temple at Jerusalem, so Mystic Baby-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Ion, represented by a woman, is said </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">make all nations drunk with </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">wine, or doctrine, which she gives them out of the golden cup which she holds in her hand. Like a great millstone Mystic Babylon shall be cast into the sea to rise no more. As the literal Israelites were invited to leave Babylon the literal, and were helped so to do<sub>c </sub>but only a few responded, so Spiritual Israelites are urged to leave Mystic Babylon, in which they have been in captivity, but only a comparatively small number have a sufficiency of courage, love and zeal to respond at the first—others will be delivered after her collapse. Now, however, the message is, “Babylon is fallen, is fallen” [that is, sentenced to fall, which sentence, we believe, will be fulfilled shortly]. &quot;Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” —Rev. 18: 2-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Where Is Mystic Babylon?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No student can examine the records without astonishment and a realization that Mystic Babylon must be some great, influential system of great power in the world during this Gospel Age, and especially at its close. The very prominence given to Babylon, both in prophecy and in Revelation, warns God’s people that if they have not yet found Babylon they should seek for her. For so great an institution as made all nations drunk with her false doctrine must be very prominent, indeed, to those who were made so under the influence of the stupefying’ draft from her cup.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Indeed, the intimation is that the whole^civilized world will be so intoxicated with the false teaching of Baby Ion as to be completely under her influence. And when she falls it is particularly explained that all the great, the rich, the mighty, the influential of earth will mourn the catastrophe of her fall. Only the saintly few will recognize its true import and rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It seems very clear that many of us were once part and parcel of this great Babylon—this great system of confusion by which the Divine character has been so traduced through the creedal misinterpretations of the Divine Word. We are aware that Catholics declare Protestants to be this Babylon system; and we are aware that Protestants claim that Catholics are this Babylon system. To our understanding of the Divine Word, both are rights Babylon is the “mother” system and the various sects of Protestantism </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font2">the “daughters,” and the name Babylon is a family name. It belongs to the “mother” system first, and to all the “daughters” of the system now, as welk Improper association with the world, its governments and systems, is </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">crime to which both are parties. The “daughters” have followed the example of the “mother,” and more or less are coming back into sympathy with her in all particulars. None of them have maintained the proper attitude of virginity and separateness from the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">We speak Not Unkindly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do not misunderstand us. We believe that there are true saints of God in all the various parts of Christendom— “mother” and “daughters.” We do not even charge nor believe that those who have upheld and are upholding the various sections of Babylon have an evil intention; we believe that they are thoroughly “drunk,” intoxicated with their own erroneous theories. The fall of their present institutions will be a startling blow to them, for they verily believe them to be Christ’s Kingdom—and style them such—Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fall of Babylon will astonish the entire world, so complete is the delusion that Christendom represents the throne and government of Messiah amongst men. And, be it remembered, the vast majority in all the various sects and denominations of Christendom are worldly people who have no conception whatever of the true Church and her cause. Their ambition is to approximate righteousness and a form of godliness, but no more than this seems to them necessary; more would be irrational, unreasonable, since they have not been begotten of the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot appreciate things from the Divine standpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To them the fall of Babylon at </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">first </span><span class="font2">is astounding, a perplexity, but will work no real injury, because the reign of Babylon over the earth will be superseded by the reign of the New Jerusalem—the Kingdom of God’s dear Son. The most saintly of God’s people will hear the voice of Divine command, “Come out of her, My people,” and will obey it before the fall comes. But a large number, even of the Lord’s people, lacking courage, will share with Babylon the troubles of that hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Subsequently, however, these will rejoice and be glad, when they realize the . justice of the Divine execution against Babylon; and to them will! come, as an inferior company, an invitation to attend the “marriage sup-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of the Lamb.” Their honorable •xasition will be that of bridesmaids to Mile still more faithful and courageous ^little flock,” who will be accounted worths to be the “Bride” and to sit with the Redeemer in His throne. ■Then speedily will follow the long-inremised “Times of Restitution” to the of mankind, for which we pray,</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">A Joyful Message for the Sin-Sick</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in Cod, believe also tn Me.&quot;—</span><span class="font1">John 14:1</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font2">HE WORLT DOES well to keep up a cheerful outward demeanor—<sup>f</sup>o '’’derive dull care away” to the best of its *Wiity. Nevertheless, there is great •Awce and weight to St. Paul’s words to effect that “the whole creation is groaning and travailing in pain together, waiting” for Messiah’s Kingdom and its long-promised blessings to lift the curse of sin and death and to &quot;restore to mankind the smile of the ‘Father’s favor. Reason though they anay that there is no personal God—&gt; fthat there is merely a blind god of mature, an evolutionary force, etc., aevertheless, deep down in the heart, aaen believe that there </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">is a God. </span><span class="font2">Almost ’unconsciously the mind attributes to fflm Wisdom, Justice and Power—but iitttle of Love or sympathy with human</span><span class="font1">ity </span><span class="font2">and its frailties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This very intuitive knowledge of i@od is closely associated with many oiuman troubles. The root of nearly every trouble, perhaps deep below the surface, is sin—disobedience to recognized principles of righteousness, and a fearful looking for of retribution, and uncertainty as to what it will mean. This is true, not only of mny Christians, but frequently true •c.kso of others who have made no profession, who have taken upon them oo solemn vows of obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This troubled heart condition does *ot. always show upon the surface. Sometimes the troubled heart is in the theatre to try to forget its troubles. Sometimes its owner is immersed in sinful pleasure-seeking, in endeavor to firown some haunting grief. Some-;times relief is sought through intoxicating liquors or narcotics; sometimes .to suicide. Sometimes the troubled »ne is on the stage. One cannot sure</span><span class="font1">ly </span><span class="font2">know that the merry laugh and witty joke and cheery song do not come from a troubled heart. We are wre that they </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">do, </span><span class="font2">in many instances, •ftor frequently those who have been indulging in merriment have committed suicide a few minutes thereafter, leav-tog messages that their hearts had Seen severely burdened, while outward</span><span class="font1">ly </span><span class="font2">cheerful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Fear of the Lord-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In our troubles we, sooner or later, realize the lack of human sympathy at least, its impotency. Feeling our helplessness, we instinctively look ia our Creator. In the hour of trouble remarkably few doubt the existence of Sod.” As Jesus said, “Ye believe in God.” But as we look to the Almighty Sor protection and consider Divine Justice and realize our own weaknesses and shortcomings, the heart of man ails. How could he think that the Omnipotent One would have interest In or care for such a worm of the dust &lt;8 he feels himself to be? How could ©ivine Justice look with any sympathy upon the course of selfishness which he recognizes stretches out be-Mnd him in full view of the All-Seeing '®ye ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">'&quot;The fear of the Lord is the begin-®8ng of wisdom,” is the inspired Message. Surely many have this begin-®lng of wisdom come to them at some period in their life’s experience. But such a fear is the start to wisdom only when it leads the fearful one to great-sr carefulness of living and to a desire for the Heavenly Father’s approval. If this be the leading of the fear, M is indeed the precursor of, the lead-sr to, wisdom. As proper fear or reverence for the Almighty comes in, it acts as a restraint upon sin. It tends ft® make one more thoughtful, more careful, more wise, in seeking for a । better way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Come by the Narrow Way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus addressed the words of our iext to Jews who, under the instruction of the Law given by Moses, had learned of Divine righteousness and the Divine requirements of all those who would come into harmony with Him. They believed in God. They tfecognized His Justice. They were desiring to be His people; they had heard</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus; they had traveled with Him as His disciples. In a general way they believed in Him. To a large degree they accepted Him as the promised Messiah and yet they found it difficult to exercise a fulness of faith. Probably there are many in this same attitude of mind today among the mil-Mons who will read this. We would 36ke to bear home upon the hearts of these the very Message that Jesus gave ft© those who heard His Voice: “Let not</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in Me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hear Him saying to us today, You already believe in the Creator and His Justice. You already have the reverential fear. You already desire to draw near to God. You have heard that He has sent His Son into the world. You have heard that this is a manifestation of His love and sympathy for you. You have heard that while you are condemned as imperfect, as sinners, as unworthy of eternal life, Divine provision has been made for your recovery through the Redeemer. As you believe in the Father’s Justice which condemned you and which justly holds you at a distance from Him as unworthy of His favor, so now believe also in Me. Believe that the Father hath sent Me. Believe that it is His Love fbr you that prompted the sending. Believe that His Love is as strong as His Justice. Believe that His Justice and Love will co-operate for your eternal comfort and blessing, if you will accept the Divine terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Losing Our Heart Troubles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Father knows your heart troubles. He wishes the burden to be there until you shall appreciate its weight—until you shall be ready to cry to Him that you are sin-sick, weary, troubled, and above all, hungering and thirsting for righteousness and desiring reconcialition to Him—the smile of His Face. He has not waited for all of this to take place before making provision for you. He has anticipated your needs, your longings, your necessities. He has already provided the Redeemer, who is Mighty to save. If Divine Justice is exacting to the last degree, believe that Divine Love, as represented in the Redeemer sent of God, is equally exhaustless, .boundless—sufficient for all your needs. If you will accept of this, the Divine arrangement through Christ, your heart troubles may be at an end. You will still have troubles in the flesh, weaknesses, aches and pains, but your heart will be joyful and happy in a fellowship Divine with the Father, through the Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Get the Peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ah! says one, I have heard of God and of Jesus and of the invitation to reconciliation, but I know not how to proceed. To whom shall I go? How can I gain a hearing in my case to obtain the blessed assurance, Thy sins are forgiven thee; go and sin no more. Which church shall I join? To what priest shall I confess?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">First of all, allow us to rejoice with you that you have come into the condition where you are seeking and knocking for the opening of the storehouse of Divine favor, because “He that seeketh shall find and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” Continue, then, to seek and to knock and very soon the blessings will be yours. See, first, whether or not you are seeking the proper blessing. You want forgiveness of sins that are past. You want the assurance of Divine love and care. You want the Heavenly Shepherd to take you for one of His sheep and look after your interests, both temporal and eternal. If so, good. You are seeking the very thing that God is pleased to give. Many are seeking something else—seeking to have some of self-will and some of God’s will, some of sin and some of righteousness. They seek in vain until, in purity of heart, they seek that which God is willing to give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All of God’s gifts are by grace. None </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">us could claim them on the grounds of justice or merit. We cannot keep God’s perfect Law, not because it is too exacting, but because we are fallen. We were born in sin, shapen in iniquity; in sin did our mothers conceive us. Be our wills ever so strong, our flesh is weak. The Divine arrangement of this Gospel Age is adapted to this very condition and is open for the honest-hearted, the sincere penitents, the ones fully determined for righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You need not come to any earthly priest, but, as the Master said, go to the Father in secret, in private. Go not in your own name or merit or worth, but in the merit of the Re-</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">deemer. Go Scripturally, claiming Him </span><span class="font2">as your Advocate and appealing in His Name for the forgiveness provided by Divine mercy—to‘cover all the sins of the past and provide for all the imperfections unwillingly yours for the future—even to the end of the way. Coming thus, Jesus becomes your Priest, your Advocate with the Father. “We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the Righteous.” (1 John 2: 1.) “Let us come with courage to the Throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in every time of need.”—Hebrews 4: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What will you say to your Father as you present yourself in the name of Jesus, do you ask? In prayer tell Him that you are sick of sin and desirous of His righteousness, in every way. Tell Him of your appreciation of the glorious qualities of His Character and of your desire to be as much conformed to that Character as possible. Tell Him that you know you have nothing worthy of His consideration, except the merit of Jesus to be imputed to you, which will be the covering for your imperfection. Tell Him that you present your </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">all, </span><span class="font2">justified by faith, that the merit of Christ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">may </span><span class="font2">be imputed; that you desire to be a living sacrifice—to be faithful unto death to Him, to His Message in the Bible and to all who are, with you, following in the good way to the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Daily Dying—Daily Living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those who have acted upon the above directions of the Lord’s Word and who have thus been accepted of the Father and begotten of the Holy Spirit, are thenceforth New Creatures in Christ Jesus. To them “old things have passed away and all things have become new.” Their souls are not troubled, because they have passed from </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">death </span><span class="font2">unto </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">life, </span><span class="font2">from Divine disfavor to Divine relationship, as sons of God—and “if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ, if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together.” (Romans 8: 17.) Those who reach this blessed state are no longer heart-troubled. They will have troubles from the world, the flesh and the Adversary, but withal they have rejoicing—“The peace of God which passeth all understanding” ruling in their hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But the end is not yet. The body has been separated from the will. The will has become identified with Christ and represents the New Creature, which will not be perfected, and in its new body, until the resurrection. Meantime, as the Apostle teaches, the flesh must be considered and treated as an enemy, because of its weakness, its fallen condition. A struggle, a battle, must go on continually to the end of the course. “Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life.” The faithfulness of the New Creature, the will, will be judged by its loyalty to the Divine will and i-ts strenuous endeavor to keep the body under—to be dead to the flesh and to the world and to be alive to the will of God. Every day should make us more alive as New Creatures and more dead as old creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this way we are, as the Apostle puts it, mortifying or deadening the flesh and being quickened or energized or made alive in spirit. This is the resurrection process for the New Crea</span></p>

It is a matter, as the Apo® tie explains, of rejoicing in tribulation^ knowing that the trials and difficulties of the present time, under God’s prov-idence, are working out for the faithful a share in that “far more exceed ing and eternal weight of glory” prom ised to the Elect, the Bride of Christ— a share in the Kingdom which shortly! through the power of the First Resurrection, will be exalted to glory an&amp; dominion over the earth. This is th® spiritual Seed of Abraham which, during Messiah’s Reign of a thousand years, is to bless Israel and, thrqugte Israel, all the families of the earth.— Galatians 3: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We cannot give this message to th® world, even as Jesus could not do so<sub>0 </sub>It is better for the world that theta hearts should now be troubled to &amp;&nbsp;considerable degree. Those who are is the most dangerous position, perhaps, are the ones who have no troubles Se the present life and, therefore, no isa centive to seek the great Burden-Bear er and fellowship with the Father through Him.

AHI agree that it would be very unreasonable for the Creator of those 1,200,000, 000 to expose them to the danger ofc eternal torment, and not give them th® slightest opportunity for hearing ofc the only terms of salvation from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But when we get the correct, th® Scriptural view of the matter, we se® that the penalty upon those 1,200,000,-000 is, “Dying, thou shalt die,” and that in this particular they are no! different from their fathers, who were under the same curse, or sentence ofc death—the Adamic condemnation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We see from the Scriptures, too, thai our Lord Jesus, “by the grace of GoS tasted death for every man”—“to b® testified in due time.” (Hebrews 2: 9,, I Timothy 2: 6.) Jesus, therefor® tasted death for all these 1,200,000,000. and for all their forefathers. He has; given the ransom-price for their sins as well as for ours, the Church’s, and a resultant blessing must come ft® them as well as to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The coming blessing is a rescue froxa the sin-and-death conditions in whicite they were born; an opportunity fo&amp; rising out of those conditions of degra dation, up, up, up, to full perfection of nature, and all that was lost through Adam’s disobedience. Thfe work of Divine Grace, we see, is to b® accomplished for the world during th® Messianic Age, when Christ and th© Elect Church will constitute God’s Kingdom, with power and great gloff? for the blessing of the world.</span></p>

The only oslass to whom present life means life ©r death eternal is the Church. And by the Church we mean, not church attendants nor outward professors, but those who have entered into a covenant with God through Christ and who </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font2">been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, tasting of the good Word of Sod and the powers of the Age to some. If these should fall away, the Apostle forewarns us, it would be impossible to renew them again unto repentance. And there will be no hope tor them with the world, in the world’s (trial Day, because they already have snjoyed their share of the merit of CTirlst’s death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When, therefore, we speak </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of God </span><span class="font2">•*ad the home, we are not having in mind a family composed exclusively saints, who daily and hourly are tollowing their great Redeemer’s footsteps in self-denial, in sacrifice, in the &quot;narrow way” which leads to “glory, honor and immortality” and association with the Redeemer in His glorious reign which will bless the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our thought is that the Bible teaches hat there are many people of the world, who are reverential, kind, gentile and just to a very considerable decree, who are not saints; who have not presented their bodies living sacrifices to God; who have not been begotten of His Holy Spirit, who are not, therefore, members of that exclusive “little flock” to whom it is the Father’s good pleasure to give the Kingdom—in joint-heirship with their (Lord and Redeemer and lead. To this latter class our Master svidently referred when He said to His footstep followers, “Let your light so shine before men that they may see your grood works and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”—Matt. 5: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To live righteously, soberly and god-Jiy in this present world to the extent ©£ one’s ability is what everyone Should do—no less.

<p><span class="font2">Bible nowhere enjoins upon mankind. It is pointed out as a privilege to those who desire it, and glory, honor and immortality on the spirit plane is the reward attached to this invitation or High Calling. It is the selection of this special class of consecrated ones that is the particular order of the Divine program at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Saint and Sinner Interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Having clearly defined what we do not mean to teach, let us now assert that, nevertheless, every sensible man and woman, saintly or not, must feel a deep interest in the welfare and moral progress of the human family, of which’ he forms a part. All, therefore, should rejoice in every movement and endeavor working to even temporary enlightenment, blessing and uplift amongst mankind. The many benevolent institutions of the civilized world attest this general thought. Our only conflict with these humanitarian efforts is that they do not approach the subject of human betterment from what we consider to be the right standpoint. With nearly all of these efforts, more or less distinctly stated, are those God-dishonoring and love-opposing intimations of an alternative of torment, either purgatorial or eternal. This is the great blight which has worked and is working incalculable harm—driving intelligent minds into opposition to the true God and the Bible, which is the revelation of His Wisdom, Justice, Love and Power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Bible freely tells us that many features of the Divine plan are now hidden in mystery, but the last book of the Bible, which prophetically pictures the future, assures us that in God’s due time “The mystery shall be finished, which He hath declared to His servants, the prophets” (Rev. 10:7). The same book assures us that in God’s due time, when the mystery is cleared, “All nations shall come and worship before Thee, for Thy righteous acts have been made manifest” (Rev. 15:4). We are now living in the time when the “mystery” is ending and the righteous dealings of God, from the Scriptural standpoint, may be clearly seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But these revelations are not meant for the world in general now, but merely for “the elect,” the “sanctified in Christ Jesus.” “To you it is given to know the mysteries”; to outsiders these things are spoken in parables and dark sayings (Matt. 13:11, 13). But not until the elect shall be glorified and the Messianic Kingdom established will the “mystery” be made fully known to the world and every knee bow and every tongue confess. Hence, only those of a contrite heart may now see, now understand, the real character of God, His real purposes toward man, etc. Thus our Lord declared, “This is life eternal that they should know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.”—John 17: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In a darker day than ours the theory, “to doubt is to be damned”, held such a power over many that they dared not use their reason. And thus a certain</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Au Inundation of Unbelief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In our day the shackles of ignorance and superstition are breaking. Men, women and children are beginning to think for themselves. They no longer believe the fairy tales of other days; the dreadful hobgoblins and nightmares of the Dark Ages respecting purgatory and eternal torture are doubted by all, and by the great mass totally disbelieved. What have they now to attach them to the Almighty, since they have never been taught the love of God—the lengths and breadths and heights and depths passing all human understanding? This is the world’s great need—to know God as He really is, a Father, a Friend, a God of love! And to thus know Him the people need to be taught how seriously they were mistaught in the past along the lines of hell and purgatory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How could they ever truly love and worship a God of injustice and of hate —One inferior to themselves—One who knew, foreordained and prepared for their torture, before they were born. They must see that these things, taught by the creeds of the Dark Ages, are wholly at variance with the Bible, else they will never come back to the Bible nor be able to see its teachings in their true light. They must be taught that the sin and death, sorrow and trouble all around us are the wage or penalty of father Adam’s disobedience. They must learn that God proposes a blessing and uplifting which will be as world wide as is the curse. They must learn that the foundation for this work was effected by the death of Jesus, the Just for the unjust. They must learn that God is now selecting a saintly class to be associates with the Redeemer in the work of uplifting and blessing Adam and his race; and that each will be held responsible and receive stripes in proportion to his knowledge and wilful disobedience; and that the persistently rebellious will be destroyed “like natural brute beasts”, in the Second Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“I Have Lost My God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not long since, in conversation svith a young lady, she said with great concern, “I fear that I have lost my God.” As a child of religious parents she had had helpful influences in her home, but in school she had come in contact with the general spirit of skepticism, which, instead of repudiating the Bible, as did Ingersoll. Paine and Voltaire, merely smiles at any reference to a Divine revelation, a faith in God and a respect for His will. These teachers are as honest, we believe, as were Ingersoll, Paine and Voltaire; nor can we deny that they have the same right to their disbelief that we claim for our belief. We can, however, say with all sincerity that it is a great pity that the learned men of Christendom are nearly all infidels, in the sense of not believing in the Bible as a Divine revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of them even deny that there is a personal God and ascribe everything to—a great Nothing, which they designate Nature-god. Is it surprising, in view of the fact that these teachings are being promulgated in the universities and colleges and theological seminaries, in the high schools, and even to some extent in the common schools—is it any wonder that the rising generation is losing its God? If it even be claimed that a bad thing is better lost than kept, we must dissent from their course. We must claim that the misconception of God can be destroyed only by the introduction to the heart and mind of the true God, whose glorious attributes of Justice, Wisdom, Love and Power will take the place of the malevolent misconceptions of the Dark Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Awakened Parental Responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is high time that parents realize the true situation—it is almost too late now. The seeds of unbelief, already sown in the minds of the rising generation, are being watered continually and are growing. All who love their families, all who love mankind in general, should awaken to the fact that a world that has lost its God must of necessity be an unhappy world. Platonic philosophy may for a time serve the purposes of the few, but surely cannot serve tlm masses of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A godless world will ere long mean a discontented world, an unhappy world and, by and by, a world of anarchy and strife. This is what our worldwide education is leading to. Few of our race can stand an education which recognizes no God, no revelation of Him, no responsibility to Him, and no hope of a future life which will be effected by the conduct of the present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">God in the Home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are not pleading for cant and rant. We are urging that in every tome God be recognized to the extent of the opportunities and influence we</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">enjoy. Parents have a special respsr sibility. Every father, in particular as the head of his family, should rec ognize the Almighty Creator, and holo Him up to his family—“God First ’ We need not urge upon God’s const crated people the privileges of pray • er and the blessed influence whiez comes through prayer to the younger members of the family. This is ont way of putting “God First”. “In al-thy ways acknowledge Him”, or, a-Joshua said: “As for me and my house we will serve the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let us now step into your home am measure things there by the Goldei Rule. As husbands, how do you trea your wives? As wives, how do yot treat your husbands? Can you apply the Golden Rule to your words, to you? conduct, to your demands of eact other? Or do you act meanly, selfish ly, taking advantage of each othei to the limit that the other will for bear? Do you deal with your childrer according to your own advanced stand ard of what a parent’s duty should bt to his children?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do you remember that you have s responsibility so far as your circum Stances will permit, for their environ ment and happiness and education am general preparation for usefulness iz life? Or are you indifferent to their interests, neglectful of your responsi bilities? Do you recognize that you&gt; children have certain rights and tha these increase as they near maturity or are you forgetful of these, disposet to keep the children under the re straints of childhood, souring their dis positions and making them unhappy until they resent the injustice and i family quarrel results?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As children, are you thoughtful o your parents, their welfare, their wish es, their happiness, as you would lik* your children to be thoughtful o yours? Do you remember the hour? and weeks of feebleness and sickness and the toil which you cost them in you &lt;&nbsp;infancy, and are you seeking to repay those kindnesses and seeking to mak» their last days the happiest of thei • lives? Are you observing the Goldez Rule toward your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How is it in your relationship to you • brothers and sisters? When they bor row your things without leave, do yov retaliate by borrowing theirs withou* leave, and thus keep up a conttoua fret and vexation of spirit in the fam ily? Or dw vou practice the Golder Rule of justice and do nothing to your brother and sister, or their belongings that you would not wish them to de to you or your things?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Love Worketh No III.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All of the Lord’s people are to love. Him and the Brethren; yea, even their enemies. However, let us now stop short of love and merely consider what the simple justice of the Golder Rule would imply in our conduct How do our daily lives square with this Golden Rule of absolute justice omitting love entirely?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you are an employer, do you trea your employe in harmony with this rule and do unto him as you woulc have him do unto you, if your posi tions were reversed? If you are ar employe, inquire of yourself, “Do treat my employer and his business as I would have him treat me and mj business, if our relationship were re versed?” Do you treat your butcher your baker, your grocer, etc., as yov would like to have them treat you, L your positions were reversed? Art you polite to them and not inclined tc give them unnecessary trouble? De you pay them promptly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Or if you are the tradesman, do yov treat your customers as you would wish to have them treat you, if condi tions were reversed? Do you chargt-them a reasonable price only? Do yov give them proper weight and measure ’ Do you properly represent your goods: to them, as you would have them rep resented to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Are you a good neighbor? Do yov see to it that your children are no; a nuisance to others; that you? chickens are not permitted to damage your neighbor’s garden; that your dog is not a ferocious one, and that hit? bark does not keep the neighborhood awake? In a word, do you treat your neighbor justly, along the lines of the Golden Rule, doing unto him only ar you would wish him to do to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He who is faithful in little things will be faithful in the greater ones. He who practices the Golden Rule during the six days of his contact with busi ness will surely be faithful on the sev enth, but faithfulness to the Golden Rule on the one day only will never win Divine approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In no way can we better honor and show our reverence for God than by following to the best of our ability His commands, which are just and right eous altogether.</span></p>

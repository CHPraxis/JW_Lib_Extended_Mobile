<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>TO MAKE EDEN BLOOM AGAIN.</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">■pOLLOWlNG in the footsteps of our a fathers, who handed down to us our present day creeds, we have misunderstood our gracious Creator. We studied astronomy and declared the Creator Almighty; we studied geology and confirmed the decision. We studied zoology and anthropology and declared that the Creator was All-Wise, as we came to appreciate Him. We noted the adaptation of our various organs to our use and comfort—the hand, the foot, the eye, the ear, the circulatory system, the nervous system, and the power of the will over these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We said to ourselves, Truly man is fearfully and wonderfully made, truly his Maker is a God infinite in wisdom and skill. We examined the subject of man’s moral sense, and although we found it impaired we have been astonished to note how even the mosj: selfish and depraved have an instinct of justice, a sense of right, whether they follow it or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Love Divine All Love Excelling.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then we said, Whence came this noble principle of Justice as the backbone or moral quality In our race;? The only reply was that in this particular God originally created man in His own moral likeness, and that , -a measure of this moral quality has persisted notwithstanding the fall through disobedience into death and its consih quent demoralization through sin ana weakness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Looking further we perceived that the noblest specimens of our race possess still other qualities closely associated with Justice, but outranking it. The noble quality which overtops all the rest we term Love. It is Love which makes the heart tender, sympathetic, helpful and happy; it is Love that makes home, whether exercised in a palace or a hovel. It is Love which backs up Justice and insists that no ill shall be worked toward a neighbor. It is Love that is on the alert to assist by word or act all of those needing aid. It is Love that inspires us to the boldest acts of heroism. It is Love that prompts the giving of time and strength, of means and even life itself on behalf of its object.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All freely admit that Love is the greatest, the most blessed quality possessed by humanity, and that without it even Paradise could, not bring happiness. We ask, Whence came this quality of Love, and from what fountain can we receive the fresh supplies so much needed by so many of our race? The anstver is that the great Creator Himself is the Fountain. “God is Love.” This All-Wise and All-Powerful and All-Just One is pre-eminently the “God of all grace,” “The Father of mercies,” “The Fountain of blessing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Love Divine, all love excelling,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Joy of heaven, to earth come down; Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All Thy faithful mercies crown.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Show Me Thy Glory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ancients had the correct thought, that they had caught but a glimpse of the Divine character and its glory; hence their prayer, “Show me Thy glory.” The same should be our sentiment. In the clear light now shining upon God’s Word we perceive that it will require the entire outworking of the Divine Plan of the Ages to illustrate or make known to humanity the real character of the Heavenly Father. Only the very few can by faith accept the Divine promises and trust in their ultimate fulfilment and see far down into the future the full shining forth of God’s character, perfect in its Wisdom, Justice, Power and Love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We may not judge the Infinite love in all respects by human comparison, but we may know that our difficulty in the matter is that the human comparisons can only imperfectly represent the Infinite. We see the excavation or perhaps the foundation walls, or perhaps the first story of a structure; but if we were to judge wholly by these imperfect parts it would be</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Sir John Jackson has obtained the contract for the construction of the first dam in the irrigation works designed by Sir William Willcox for the Turkish Government, with the object of again making an Eden of Mesopotamia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sir William Willcox, who has been engaged in surveying the land between the Tigris and the Euphrates, in 1908 predicted that this vast territory, now an arid waste infested by swamps, but showing traces of ancient irrigation canals, would again blossom as the rose, provided that works, of which this dam is the first, be carried out.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE COST OF SOUL-SAVING.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">It is quite in line with the commercial spirit of the age to have Billy Sunday, the evangelist, estimate the cost of saving souls in various cities. In Atlanta, he says, it requires an outlay of only $75 to rescue a soul; in New York city, $545; in Boston, $450; In Denver, $425; in Chicago, $395; in New Orleans, $78, and in Indianapolis $620.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While it would be interesting to know just how the evangelist reached his interesting results, it would not be easy to accept them even with an itemized account at hand. It is not conceivable that it costs more to save a soul in Indianapolis than in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Moreover-, - the expenditures </span><span class="font3">of .Mr^. Sunday cannot be taken as a criterion of the price of saving souls. His hotel bills may be higher than those of other so-called soul-savers. As a baseball player, which was his former occupation, he may have contracted the habit of staying at the best hotels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Soul-saving is scarcely a commercial business.- Evangelists, however, find it a much more profitable business than do the average preachers in home churches. Many evangelists have become rich. Those who use dramatic methods make more money than the conservative ones.—Exchange.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>THEY SHALL SAY PEACE! PEACE!</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">How the promise of peace grows! Even Japan is ready for a peace pact, and has taken the initiative toward reaching a general arbitration treaty with the United States. No formal proposition has yet been made, but through diplomatic channels the Japanese government has made it known that it is willing to submit proposals if invited. This is progress for the peace campaign, surely. Japan has been popularly looked upon as the most pugnacious nation of the Orient, and of the world—spoiling for a fight and swelling with military ambition. Now, we are told, the only obstacle to the initiation of negotiations between the United States and Japan for a general arbitration treaty is that “the Japanese government hesitates to make the first advances because it has no official intimation that such a movement would be welcome in the United States.” All doubt en that point should be speedily removed, Col. Roosevelt to the contrary notwithstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After the foregoing was written, but before it was put in type, came the extraordinary information from Washington that “the German government has sent a most sympathetic answer to the United States government’s inquiry as to whether Germany had any interest in a general arbitration treaty. The answer requests the Washington government to communicate the full details of the proposed treaties with Great Britain and France and promises that Germany will subject them to most careful and friendly scrutiny with &amp;&nbsp;view to declaring later how far the proposals, appear acceptable.” Germany, •with her war-lord Emperor, has been supposed least favorable of all the nations of Europe to the general arbitration movement. Should that nation give the matter favorable consideration, the permanent peace of the world would surely be in sight.—</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Michigan ■Christian Advocate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">manifestly unfair and we should be deceiving ourselves. The only way to judge of the builder’s capacity and intentions would be to see the architectural drawing and to study the details —and then we could but very imperfectly appreciate the whole. Is it not thus in respect to the great Maker’s present work and ultimate designs?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If we stand beside a great sculptor with his freshly chosen block of mar* ble, we may at first feel shocked to note the apparent roughness and carelessness with which he smites off large pieces of the stone, as though bent on its destruction. But let patience have her perfect work, and gradually we will see that the sculptor has not been careless or indifferent in respect to a single blow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the while that he seemed so reckless he was working according to the ideal before his own mind. With his mind’s eye he saw his ideal in the stone, and blow after blow, chip after chip merely revealed to our eyes what he had purposed in himself from the beginning of his work. Not until his work was finished could we comprehend fully the ideal. Is not this principle still more true of our Creator? He tells us that He is “working all things according to the counsel of His own will,” which He purposed in Himself “before the world was.”—Eph. 1: 11; 3: 10, 11.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The great Master Workman of the Universe will eventually show both to angels and men all the various attributes of His perfection—His Wisdom, Justice, Power and Love. Meantime, “None of the wicked shall understand,” but in the End of this Age the wise will increasingly understand His purposes, hidden from all except His saints, of whom it is written, “The secret of the Lord is with them that reverence Him”; “He will show you things to come.”—Psalm 25: 14; John 16: 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Now Apply the Principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let us apply this principle to the work of our great Creator. Let us see how far it has already progressed. In what state of development is the Divine Plan today? What will be required to complete it and to manifest Divine Wisdom, Justice, Love and Power? Only by a careful examination of the Great Architect’s revealed plan can we judge at all of the degree to which His purposes have already attained perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The wreck and blight of human interests resulting from Father Adam’s disobedience progressed for twenty-five hundred years before the first step was taken in the Divine Program on man’s behalf. That first step was merely the making of a rough outline drawing with various crude illustrations which merely hinted at one or another of the Creator’s glorious purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Israel as a nation pictured all the world of mankind who will ultimately come into fellowship with God. Their one tribe of Levi typified the Household of Faith, “the Church of the First-born” of this Gospel Age, through whom all blessings will come to the remainder. The select Levites, the priests, typified the Royal Priesthood—the better Mediator. The sacrifices by which that Covenant was established, and that people brought into harmony with God, typified the better sacrifices of Christ, which began with our Lord and have continued in His faithful followers who present their bodies living sacrifices, wholly and acceptable to God through Him. —Rom. 12: 1.</span></p>

Manifestly only those who could understand those roughly sketched drawings could comprehend to any degree the great Divine Plan of the Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With this Gospel Age God began </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">great work which is yet far from finished and which as yet does not show forth fully to mankind in general His Justice, Wisdom, Power or Love. The vzork of this Age, according to the Scriptures, is the selection of both the Church, which is “The Bride, the Lamb’s Wife,” and “the virgins, her companions, who follow her.”—Psalm 45: 8-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible declares that Jesus, the Redeemer, having finished His sacrifice, passed into glory—beyond the veil ■—to the right hand of Divine Majesty. It declares also that when this Age .shall be completed all the faithful followers of Jesus will pass to Him beyond the' veil and share His glory and His Kingdom and immortality on the heavenly plane. But how few there are who see this much of the Divine Plan; and if they cannot see this much how could they be expected to see still further into the future developments of the Divine Program?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the sentence of death came as the result of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font3">transgression,, but involved the race, so </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font3">sacrifice for sin, by the “Man Christ Jesus,” was sufficient to be a Ransom-Price for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">sins </span><span class="font3">of the whole world—a man’s life for a man’s life. Thus as condemnation came through one man unto death, so justification is provided through this other Man unto everlasting life.—-Rom. 5: 16, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ’s Sacrifice Offsets Adam’s Sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But although so broad a foundation for human salvation was laid by the great Master Workman, the Message and the blessing therein have not been granted as yet to the majority, but to the few-—-“He that hath an ear to near, let him hear”; “As many as the Lord your God shall call”; “No man can come unto Me, except the Father which sent Me draw him.” And this calling and drawing, though in one sense free, is in another sense restricted to those who are in the heart condition of being drawn a'nd of hearing the call. All others remain blinded to the Divine invitation by the god of this world.—2 Cor. 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Evidently those now being drawn and “called” are not the whole world, but a select class. Those who prove themselves faithful to the end are styled </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“the very elect.” </span><span class="font3">These are the Royal Priesthood who, as priestly Kings, will be associated with Messiah in His glorious, world-wide Empire which “shall rule from sea to sea and from the river unto the ends of the earth,” for the binding of Satan, the overthrow of sin, and the uplifting of sinners. But we are to clearly distinguish between the present work of selecting the Royal Priests, the Bride, the Lamb’s Wife, and the work for the world, which these will accomplish after their glorification on the spirit plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We must thus distinguish, because looking upon the revealed plans of the great Architect of the Universe, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">we, </span><span class="font3">perceive that thus He has arranged— the Church, as the Bride of Christ, is to constitute “a New Creation,” “partakers of the divine nature—like unto her Lord. These on the plane of glory will have a station “far above principalities and powers and every name that is named.”—Eph. 1: 21; Rev. 3: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whoever can see this to be the Divine Plan must with the eye of faith look down to the future and behold the Church—“changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,” because “flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.” Here is love, wondrous love, in lifting up members of the sinner race to glory, honor and immortality. Who can comprehend such love as this which the Father- has bestowed upon Jesus and the “little flock” of His followers who walk in His steps?</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Blood Atonement For Sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our text refers to a blood-atone-' ment for sin. The Law Covenant required the death of a bullock and a goat, but the repetition of these sacrifices every year indicated that no cancellation was effected thereby—-merely a typical covering of sin for a year. The Law required an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a man’s life for a man’s life, which implies that a perfect man must of necessity die in order to be the Redeemer of Adam and the race which shared his cohdemnation. The bullock of the sin-offering, therefore, was merely a type of a better sacrifice. The true sacri-</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font3">a law of nature, which applies both, to animal and vegetable life. We are-informed that all such breedings return to their original species in the third or fourth generation. It is even pointed out now that diseases of the ’■ blood proceed no further than the third or fourth generation, and thia most fortunately, otherwise the physical health of humanity might be much more impaired than it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Is not this a direct corroboration of that Bible statement which some of us</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">As in the type the blood of the bullock was used to make a typical atonement, so in the antitype the blood of Jesus is efficacious to make atonement for the sins of the whole world. In the type an earthly priest offered the blood in an earthly tabernacle; in the antitype, He who became the Sin-Offering, begotten of the Holy Spirit, at the time of His consecration, was therefore recognized as the great Antitypical High Priest. After His resurrection He ascended on high, “to appear in the presence of God for us”—for the Church —first; and when the Church shall be completed, He will appear for the world. He will seal the New Covenant for Israel, applicable to all the families of the earth, through Israel. Then, as the great Mediator of that New Covenant [Jer. 31: 31], He will, for a thousand years, reign as King of earth, the Antitype of Melchisedec—-a Priest</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">appealed were very rarely Christians at all; hence they destroyed very little faith—they merely made the unbelief more rank and foul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But these Higher Critic infidels of this “evil day” are making use of all the vast machinery of Christendom in all denominations, especially through theological seminaries, to undermine and overthrow the faith of all who have named the name of Christ, great and small, rich and poor, cultured and ignorant. It is being done systematically, too, craftily, deceitfully, in a manner that the masses of the people would scarcely credit. It is safe to say that fully four out of five who graduate from theological seminaries of all denominations are Higher Critic infidels, who are instructed that their main business is to promote morality amongst the people, especially to build up Churchianity, particularly their own denomination, and to gradually, stealthily, craftily wean the people from the faith of the Bible to their higher critical dogmas. And they are succeeding most wonderfully. A “pestilence” is the only figure of speech which really fits to this pernicious influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Out of Thine Own Mouth Will I Judge Thee,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">said the Lord, and in harmony with this we find that in the Lord’s providence these Higher Critics are gradually more and more telling on themselves. But the nominal Christian is quite obtuse, and many of the true Christians, as the Apostle explains, are merely “babes in Christ,” unable to use the strong meat of the Word, and capable only of enjoying or using the “milk of the Word,”—incapable of assimilating its strong meat. Hence the open declarations of these wolves in sheep’s clothing, who masquerade as sheep, are not taken seriously. If the sheep are startled by the words, they are soothed again by the thought,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">The Paradise lost when Adam sinned was a miniature one. It is to be restored and to be world-wide in extent. “G£&gt;d will make His earthly footstool glorious.” He has promised to make His footstool glorious—-“He formed it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited.”—Isa. 60: 13; 66: 1; 45: 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the earthly Eden it will be inhabited by its master, man; the restored earth would be naught without its master restored. And this is the Divine provision, that as by a man came death, sin, sorrow, pain, trouble, “by a Man also shall come the resurrection of the dead,” the uplifting of Adam’s race, mentally, morally, physically, to human perfection, happiness and everlasting life. Earth’s blessings will be</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">declaration that He would “visit” the sins of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation?” (Ex. 20: 5.) It now appears that, instead of being a mark of Divine disfavor, it is a mark of Divine mercy that hereditary taint in the blood is limited to the third or fourth generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A celebrated physician and scientist, Dr. William Hanna Thomson, promulgating this theory, said:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Professor George H. F. Nuttall, of ' the University of Cambridge, took up the subject and has so extended its application that a single drop of blood from any animal now suffices, not only to show by its own peculiar chemical reaction what animal it comes from, but also how nearly related an animal is by his blood to other animals. It begins, therefore, to look as if the whole classification of zoology might have to be re-arranged according to these blood tests. Thus a drop of blood fronf a walrus shows no relation to a drop of whale’s blood, or the blood of any other cetacean, such as seals or poi-poises, which, like the walrus, are mammals that have taken to the sea.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We may be sure that those who hold fast to the teachings of the Bible will come out on the right side of the argument in the long run. The endeavor of worldly-wise men to get away from God’s Book has led many of them to extremes of thought and of statement, which some day will be fully rectified to their shame. The Bible foretells this, saying, “The wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.” (Isa. 29: 14.) St. Paul refers to science, falsely so-called, which will ultimately be proven entirely wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Complete Sin-Atonement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For nearly six thousand years .tia reign of sin and death has prevailed. It is nearly two thousand years since the Redeemer came to give His life as man’s redemption price, yet still the reign of sin and death continues. It Is not because the blood of Christ was insufficient to satisfy the claims of Justice for the sins of the world, but because, before the merit of the blood of Christ could be given to Adam and his race, it must have a previous use. That use has been in progress for the past eighteen centuries, during which it has been the basis of the Church’s justification by faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Atonement For the Soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In our text the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">soul </span><span class="font3">is * synonym for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">person </span><span class="font3">or </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">being. </span><span class="font3">Father Adam was a human soul, a human being, so also his children.

They well know that outside the Bible there is nothing but guess work, and they prefer their own guesses to those of other people. Very many of them speak candidly and tell that they are agnostics, that they are uncertain and would like to be informed respecting the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A very similar condition growingly prevails amongst the poorer classes and the uneducated, who say, We believed the scholars when they told us the Bible was inspired. Why should we not believe them now when they declare that it is a ffaud? As the wealthy doubt that God will specially' favor them, so the poor doubt whether God will specially disfavor them. Both classes are reaching the conclusion that fortune or disaster rests, not with the Lord, but with themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The World’s Need—a God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The- effect of all this loss of faith in an Almighty God is seen on every hand and is felt by many. One of the consequences is that the religious element of man’s nature is becoming numb and the masses, rich and poor, are seeking<sup>1</sup> a substitute in pleasure; as the Apostle’s words foretold, they are “lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.” - Additionally, many of the wealthy carry on a kind of brigandage along commercial lines. Desirous of imitating them, but unable so to do, others are fining the world with violence to an extent that is alarming to everybody. Were it not for our elaborate and costly police protection life and property would be far less secure in civilized lands than amongst the heathen. With all the protection afforded by telephone, telegraph, police, etc., etc., our rulers and officials tell us that they are often bewildered in their attempts to preserve law and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many learned men believe that there is ho other God than Nature; and many of the unlearned are following their lead. They reason that Nature served them as both father and mother, that Nature is pitiless, unsympathetic, cruel. Indeed, this is one of their special arguments against a personal God, for they say that such a God would not permit the sufferings we witness on every hand and the still, more terrible sufferings which the creeds of Christendom have taught them are in store for all except the saintly few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is time that we return to the Bible proposition and see the truth of the statement, “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” Surely there is something wrong .with the brain which, after noting the wonders of nature, seen in the surrounding worlds and systems and attested in all matters earthly, sees not an intelligent Creator! The wonderful adaptability of Our own bodies tells of a wise Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If we compare the human eye, adapted to its purposes and conditions, with the eye of a fish, adapted to its different conditions, and with the eye of a beetle, adapted to. still different conditions, we see the most indubitable proofs of profoundest wisdom and superhuman skill. When we think of man’s wonderful powers and, of his great achievements in the world and rhen consider his inability to make a single living thing, from a microbe to an elephant, from a tiny seed to a tree, surely we should concede that the One who ordered nature in the production of these wonderful variations, and created man himself, must be an Almighty, intelligent God. Surely “Day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge” along these lines, to those who have the eyes of understanding to see. It is time that these great truths were being emphasized and that the boastful gentlemen who ignore them should have their true measure taken, regardless of how many titles may follow their names. The moderately educated as well as the illiterate need such a testimony to come from every pulpit. And if it does not soon come our civilization will be wrecked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">All-Seeing Eye Not Omnipresence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Thou, God, seest me;” “The eye of the Lord is in every place.” These</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">lightning flash serves as a Divine messenger. But we can believe that a Soul so Infinitely high above us possesses powers of information as far beyond our comprehension as the telephone and wireless telegraphy and electric light were beyond the comprehension which our forefathers had of these things in their day. It is easier to believe that so great a Being as the One who formed man should have All-Wisdom and All-Power than to believe Him deficient of these. The Scriptural argument is a good one; “He that formed the eye, shall He.not see? He that formed the ear, shall He not hear?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">God In Heaven and In Hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The creeds handed down to us from the dark past declare that God is everywhere present—omnipresent. This is as unthinkable as it is foolish and unscriptural. Taking advantage of this error of “orthodoxy,” 'the Adversary has turned many away from a belief in a personal God. He who is everywhere is nowhere. The result is the absurd view which has taken hold on some otherwise intelligent people, to the effect that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">good </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font3">are synonymous: Hence a log of wood that is good for something, that can be made into something useful, is said to have </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">good </span><span class="font3">in it, and, hence, to have </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font3">in it—ditto, a piece of iron, a bed, a chair, a table. The folly grows into saying that God is everywhere and is in everything. Thus faith in a god of nature and happen-so takes the place of faith in the God of the Bible, whose residence is in heaven, but whose intelligence and power extend throughout the Universe, in thousands of ways of which we are only learning —through electricity, radio activity, etc., besides angelic messengers that can come and go like the wind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our text, misunderstood, is supposed to teach Divine omnipresence, whereas it really teaches Divine Omniscience and Almighty power. The Lord’s presence, as represented in His intelligence and power, are everywhere. Nowhere could we go to be beyond His reach and beyond His knowledge. Were this thought thoroughly impressed upon every human mind, what a vast difference it would make in human conduct from that now seen—in Wall Street, in banks, in palaces, in hovels, in saloons, in gambling houses—everywhere. It is the great lesson needed by the whole world. Everyone who believes this should join with nature in attesting Divine Wisdom,' Power, Justice and Love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But really the undermining of faith in the God of the Bible has been accomplished largely by the misrepresentation of the Bible’s teaching. Our text, for instance, is supposed to teach that God is in heaven with the saintly, rejoicing with them and enjoying their' pleasure and that He also is in hell with the unsaintly, looking upon their sufferings and tortures and planning with devils for their everlasting 'continuance. Thinking minds are rejecting such nonsense, but, alas, they are rejecting the Bible, too, hence have no foundation for a better, truer faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every educated minister knows that we tell the Truth to the common people when we say that the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">hell </span><span class="font3">in our text has not the slightest reference to a place of torture, or even of consciousness. Indeed this is true of every occurrence of the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">hell, </span><span class="font3">from Genesis to Malachi. In every instance the translation is from the same Hebrew word, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">sheol, </span><span class="font3">which signifies </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the grave, the tomb, </span><span class="font3">and is thus most frequently translated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We urge upon all ministers of education to join with us in explaining to the public the true meaning of the Hebrew word </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">sheol </span><span class="font3">and the Greek word </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">hades. </span><span class="font3">Whatever may have been their thought of expediency in the past they should see that the mistaken views of the meaning of these words are undermining the faith of Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Psalmist really said, “If I ascend up into the sky, Thou art there: if I make my bed in </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">sheol </span><span class="font3">(the grave), behold, thou art there. * * * In the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall Thy hand lead me and Thy right hand shall hold me.” The thought is that the Divine Power is everywhere, that whether we live or die, nothing can separate us from God’s Wisdom</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">yokes, have any knowledge of the Mystery of the Cross of Christ, the Mystery of the Gospel, “The Mystery which hath been hid from ages and generations, but now is made manifest to His saints.”—Col. 1: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Alas, the majority seem content to have merely a “name to live” and wish merely to be </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">called </span><span class="font3">Christians and to wear a jeweled cross. It is but the few of those who have tasted that the Lord is gracious and have felt an earnest desire to know and to do the Father’s will at the cost of self-sacrifice. With the majority the intimation that a certain course in life is the “narrow way,” the way of the Cross, is sufficient to turn them in an opposite direction; for, while they would like to share the heavenly glories and honors of the Lord, they are unwilling to be sharers in His ignominy, sufferings and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These, without relinquishing their desire for righteousness, are disinclined to go to such lengths as the Master and the Apostles taught and exemplified. Hence, they are not interested in the “deep things” of God’s Word, but merely in the more superficial. In the language of the Scriptures, they are willing to say, “We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by Thy name, to take away our reproach” (Isa. 4: 1). The fault lies largely with many of the clergy, who are .not leading the people to “the faith once delivered to the saints,” but away from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures most distinctly teach that we are under the reign of the “Prince of this world,” Satan, and that our Lord at His Second Coming-in power and great glory will bind or restrain this strong one and overthrow his empire, which is not of Divine authorization but built upon human weaknesses, ignorance and superstition. We are distinctly told that Satan shall be bound for that thousand years (the Millennium) that he may deceive the people no more until the thousand years shall be finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Surely, then, the Lord has used the great Adversary to assist in the accomplishing of the Divine purposes. Satan may have supposed that he was frustrating God’s plans, but just as surely he was mistaken. The Divine Word is . sure which declares, “My Word that goeth forth out of My mouth shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in that whereunto I sent it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is time that all who really believe in the Bible, who really believe that Jesus left the glory of the Father and humbled Himself even unto death, thus providing the redemptive price for the Church and for the world, should proclaim these facts clearly, positively. They should also declare, as do the Scriptures, the Second Coming of the Redeemer and the establishment of His Kingdom in Divine power and majesty, for the putting down of sin and the lifting up of mankind to glorious privileges of Restitution, with a just penalty against every form of sin, and the Second Death as the penalty for wilful, persistent disobedience,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">and Power and from the ultimate accomplishment of our rescue from the power of the grave, which God has purposed and has promised shall be done through the great Messiah. For His Kingdom we wait and pray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Is This View Unorthodox?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">orthodox </span><span class="font3">signifies “correct in doctrine.” We are ready to admit that our presentation is not the ordinary one—but we claim that it is correct, that it is the true doctrine of the Word of God. If so, it is orthodox, in the highest sense of that term, and everything to the contrary, being opposed to the standards of God’s Word, must be unorthodox. Everything depends upon our standard. We stand for the Bible, its ’. aching, its doctrines, and therefore are &lt;&nbsp;&quot;thodox. On the contrary, ' .gher Critics and Evolutionists and those who hold the creeds of the “Dark Ages,” contradictory to the Bible, are proportionately unorthodox— heretical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What Christendom needs today is a return to the Bible, an investigation of its teachings and, correspondingly, a rejection of all human creeds, which are admittedly more or less defective. Let us “stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free.” Let us accept the Bible as the only Standard. Let us study it and understand it to the extent of our ability. Let us rejoice in every degree of harmony we all attain in the correct understanding of it. Let us fellowship as Christians all who acknowledge its Divine authenticity and who, in harmony with its presentation, are trusting in Jesus as their Redeemer; and who, in acceptance of His invitation, have forsaken all to be His footstep followers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These are the real Christians, with whatever sect or party they may have become identified, through the supposition that they were doing the will of God. These alone are the saints; these alone are running in the race course; these alone have the opportunity of making their “calling and election sure.” The masses known as Christ-tendom are unchristian in every sense of the word. They are civilized heathen, in the sense that they do not recognize any more than do the. heathen, a personal God of glorious character, perfect in His Wisdom, Justice, Love and Power. They realize not His All-' seeing Eye. And their general lives show their lack of this knowledge and this faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">More than this (shall we say it?) the majority of professed church members, so far as we can understand their sentiments as privately expressed and publicly declared by the ministers of their choice, are no more Christians than are the Jews. They neither believe the Bible to be the Divine Revelation nor do they accept the Lord Jesus Christ as the world’s Redeemer from sin and death. Of course, therefore, they do not profess to consecrate their lives to sacrificially follow One in whose redemptive work they do not believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Mystery of the Cross,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Comparatively few of the hundreds of thousands of those who have named the name of Christ, and who have come under various denominational</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Making a Covenant With the Lord</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Choose ye this day whom ye will serve; as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.&quot;—Joshua 24:15,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">T</span><span class="font3">HE Children of Israel had crossed Jordan. Moses was depd and Joshua was their Leader. They were having no difficulty at that time; but Joshua thought that it was proper just then for them to make their decision—proper &nbsp;for them to decide</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">whether or not they would be faithful to the Lord, or would allow themselves to be led away by the idolatry of the people who lived in Canaan. Joshua had called them together and had recounted to them the Lord’s blessings and favor which they had thus far enjoyed, and then expressed himself in the grand and noble sentiments of our text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So, we who realize that the Lord has been blessing, guiding and sustaining us in the past, should come to a full, positive </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">decision </span><span class="font3">as respects our course of life. The very fact of coming to a positive decision is a great help in the formation of character. Every time we come to a wise decision on any question, it strengthens mind and character, and makes us much more ready for another test —along some other line, perhaps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We well recognize the fact that the entire consecration which the Christian makes, leaves nothing out; but we need to have some touchstone, something which will enable the mind to reach a decision quickly, and this touchstone should be </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s will, </span><span class="font3">so that to perceive the Lord’s will on any subject would be to settle it without any temporizing. Again, it is highly proper that we should reiterate our consecration, and thus make it prominent before others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For instance, there would be noth</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">ing wrong in saying, “Whatever any one else may do, I acknowledge God and will serve him!”—not as a new vow, but as a fresh acknowledgment of the consecration Vow we have already taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every day we should renew our covenant with the Lord—renew it and make it fresh in our minds, thus showing that there has been no change on our part; that we are still in the saiqe attitude. We are exhorted to make this review of our lives and renewal of our consecration daily; to continue to keep this before our minds and hearts; to render our sacrifice to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If the Lord’s consecrated people could be brought to the point where the chief aim in life, the burden of all their prayers, would be that they might have a larger measure of the Spirit of the Lord, the spirit of holiness, the spirit of the Truth, the spirit of Christ, the spirit of a sound mind, what a blessing it would mean! If then they should wrestle with him until the breaking of day, their hold upon him would be sure to bring the desired Dless-ing. The Lord reveals Himself for the purpose of giving this blessing; but He withholds it until we learn to appreciate and desire it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PULPIT HAS LOST POWER.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font2">HE Rev. Lyman Abbott, of New York, spoke sadly of the decadence of the power of the pulpit, addressing 3,000 University of Wisconsin men and women at a convention at Madison, Wis. ‘It is said the cloth has lost its power—it has,’ said Dr. Abbott. ‘jt is said the pulpit has lost its power—it has. But a man, altruistic in the highest sense and spiritual, will never lose his power.’ ” * * </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">*—Press Report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was certainly appropriate that Dr. Abbott should make the above statement to college people. Admitting the facts, let us And also their cause. It </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font2">because of the inconsistency of its teaching that the pulpit has lost its power with the masses. The pulpit backs up and endorses the teachings </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">all the colleges of our day along the lines of Higher Criticism and Evolution. The people are coming </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">understand that this means that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">pulpit is in antagonism to the Bible. If Evolution be true, man never fell and hence needed no Redeemer and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font2">saving from a fallen state, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font2">needed merely to be let alone in his evolutionary progress. According to Higher Criticism the Bible in general is unreliable. Moses never wrote the books accredited to him, and Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel and others never wrote the books accredited to them— never were inspired of God to write these books. And if this be true, then Jesus and the Apostles were deceived and could not have been inspired by God when they quoted from these sacred writings of the past and declared them to be the Word of God and vouched for their authorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">No Wonder Church Attendance Is Slim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the other hand the public notice that the very ministers who thus preach Evolution, Higher Criticism, unbelief in the Divine Revelation, keep right along preaching some of the absurdities which our forefathers claim</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font2">were in harmony with the Bible. Is it any wonder that the people are coming to see the inconsistency of Buch a position?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The result is that the masses have less and less confidence in the clergy. The people do not know what the clergy believe even when they hear them speak, for their address may be from the standpoint of the creeds or from the standpoint of Higher Criticism, according to their moods. The result of this uncertain sounding of the trumpet is that the masses are coming to the conclusion that the whole matter of religion is a big guess and that some of the guesses are influenced by temporal considerations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The unbelief of the people grows and threatens to become agnosticism, or worse, atheism! Those who have brought about this condition of things during the past thirty years are the college professors and the best educated pulpiteers of Christendom. And now they stand astonished at the results, which they should have foreseen. Verily they are fulfilling the Divine prophecies of Isaiah, which, referring to our day, declare, “The wisdom of their wise men shall perish; the understanding of their prudent men shall not be manifest.” (Isa. 29:14.) No wonder the civilized world is in trepidation as it sees the onward march of Socialism! And however honest and well intentioned many Socialists may be, the result of their effort will spell anarchy and a time of trouble such as the world has never yet seen —a time of trouble, however, predicted by Daniel the Prophet, whose prediction was endorsed by Jesus Himself.—Dan. 12: 1; Matt. 24:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">* * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What is the remedy? No remedy can possibly reach the disease! The Bible rightly understood • is the balm of Gilead which alone could have helped. But matters have gone so far that comparatively few have sufficient confidence in the Bible to be willing to make a re-examination of it in the light of the Divine Plan of the Ages, which alone shows the harmony of the Word of God, from beginning to end.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PASTOR RUSSELL HEARD FROM</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">O</span><span class="font2">UR REPORTER called on Pastor Russell immediately after his return from his British appointments. He was just ready to start on his World Tour as chairman of the Committee appointed by the International Bible Students Association to examine into and report on the Progress of Foreign Missions in the conversion of the world to Christianity. Replying to our reporter’s queries Pastor Russell said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I had a very enjoyable sojourn with the British. Since I left here on October 4th I delivered 55 addresses in 24 cities to approximately 44,000 people: In England, 31 meetings (12 of these in the London Tabernacle); in Scotland, 14 meetings; in Ireland, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font2">meetings, and in Wales, 4 meetings; and going and coming on the steamers I had excellent opportunities for literary work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While abroad did you learn of the further attacks made upon you by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Brooklyn Eagle?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Oh, yes! friends sent me clippings from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle </span><span class="font2">respecting myself; one remarking on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle’s </span><span class="font2">70th anniversary that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle </span><span class="font2">evidently belonged to the nest mentioned in Revelation 18:2, “A cage of every unclean and hateful bird.” Another wrote, “The Filthy Eagle.” Another declared its </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">three score and ten </span><span class="font2">past and its decline well under way, remarking, if by reason of (financial) strength it attain four score, yet it will be with labor and sorrow. I am sorry for the poor old thing. Once it had quite a decent reputation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I can speak for the “Peoples Pulpit Association” and for your many friends in Brooklyn and everywhere, and assure you that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle’s </span><span class="font2">spite toward you is fully realized. We are sure that you have a complete answer to every charge. These answers your friends do not need, but perhaps you would give the public a few words through the columns of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Peoples Pulpit. </span><span class="font2">Our little journal reaches twenty readers to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle’s </span><span class="font2">one in this great </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Surely, I will be pleased to reply </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">any queries you may suggest. But you must not expect me to render evil </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font2">evil or slander for slander. As </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">follower of Christ I am under orders </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">copy the Captain of our salvation, “who when He was reviled, reviled not again,” but committed His interests to Divine care. He died for those who cried, “Crucify Jesus and release Barabbas the robber.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The senility of the poor old </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle </span><span class="font2">is shown by the character of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">news </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font2">purveys. Think of a Twentieth Century </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">newspaper </span><span class="font2">dishing up matter dated 1894, in its venomous attacks upon a preacher; and his chief faults are that he has the largest audiences and refuses to allow collections to be taken; and proves to the people that the Bible is true and that the fault is with the creeds of the Dark Ages; and proves also from the Bible that God is love, and that He has not provided eternal torture for any of His creatures, but that the Bible hell and punishment for wilful sins are wholly different from what we once supposed. Neither the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle, </span><span class="font2">nor the preachers whom it represents, any longer believe the eternal torture theory, but they want the people to so believe until ready to drop the Bible entirely and join the “Higher Critics” in their </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">new </span><span class="font2">Gospel, viz., “By Evolution are ye saving yourselves and your race; your first parents did not fall; they were Apes; ye need no Redeemer, nor faith in one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The poor old </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle </span><span class="font2">miscalculates </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">mental and moral caliber of its readers, or else I do. Its intelligent readers should see through its venal attacks, and should not be deceived. Those of its readers who are of filthy mind—-“Let them be filthy still.” (Rev. 22:11.) I do not crave their good will. “Birds of a feather flock together!” Those who have charge of advertising my meetings have promised me that they will never again use the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle </span><span class="font2">columns.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">I have little to add to the interview you published last October. I then explained matters quite fully. I have many Christian friends who know me personally and through my books on Bible study, and through my sermons which reach ten millions of readers weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I remind you briefly of the facts: A most excellent and noble wife became mentally poisoned by “Women’s rights.” When I refused to allow such ideas a place in my journal, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Watch Tower, </span><span class="font2">she became my bitterest enemy. First she tried to coerce me. This failing she since seeks to destroy my influence. Yet never was a wife more kindly treated. Our property by mutual consent was all devoted to the Lord’s cause whilst we were in fullest accord. Provision was made merely for the necessities of life for both of us. When she changed her mind she demanded the money we had devoted to God’s cause. I paid her forty dollars per month. She appealed to the courts for more money. However, that is all settled, for in 1909 during my absence in Europe preaching, five of my friends, all men, made up a purse of $10,000, settled with Mrs. Russell and took her receipts for five-years’ allowances ordered by the court, which they knew I had not means to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What about Rose Ball going to Australia?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Why, of course, she did not stay a child in short dresses all the time. She married and went to Australia with her husband! Remember, this is quite ancient history which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle </span><span class="font2">considers </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">news. </span><span class="font2">Twenty years ago Rose kissed my wife and me every night when she retired. And she did this at my wife’s suggestion. It was at that time that she came crying to me and sat on my knee to tell her troubles—as to a father.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">No one knows better than my wife that there was absolutely nothing impure in any of my dealings with that foster child. I did not get a chance to furnish my testimony in Court because the trial-judge discerned that n® immorality was charged in my wife’s plea and ordered everything of the kind stricken from the Court records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On what plea then did she get </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">divorce?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">She </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">did not get </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">divorce at all? </span><span class="font2">the court merely made a decree of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">separation. </span><span class="font2">A sympathetic jury concluded that we both would be happier legally separated. My wife’s charge contained not a suggestion of immorality. It charged </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“cruelty.” </span><span class="font2">The evidence submitted to her attorneys seemed to them rather slim proofs of cruelty, and two sets of lawyers abandoned her case. The third set of attorneys “cooked” up some so-called evidence including the story about Rose Ball, then married and gone to Australia and who long years before was our foster child. Emily Matthews, the housemaid of twenty years ago, had also married. Hearing of the case she came to Court </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">voluntarily </span><span class="font2">to testify on my behalf. But before I could put ter on the witness stand the Court had ruled that portion of my wife’s testimony “eut of court” and to be stricken off the Court records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My wife knew everything and never for one minute doubted my faithfulness as a husband. She merely sought revenge, because I. did not accede to her “women’s rights” notions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So far from claiming immorality on my part, my wife’s bill of complaint charged that I had never cohabited with her in the eighteen years of our married life. And her attorney taunted me with this. They neglected to tell the full truth; that the arrangement was by my wife’s full consent, and changeable at potice by either party. She well knew that I had never indulged in sexual intercourse with any person; and to this moment I have lived an absolutely celibate life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">THE END OF THE WORLD </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">A FALS</span><span class="font9">E THEORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Text'.—&quot;Ana theAngei swore.. . that ike time should be no longer [delayed}.''—</span><span class="font2">Rev. io:^ 7.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7">O</span><span class="font2">UR TEXT, with other Scriptural statements respecting the end of the world (for instance, St. Peter’s statement, “The heavens being on fire shall be dissolved”), have led Christians in general to accept the theory that God has decreed that shortly, or at some time, our earth is to be burned. The early Church expected and prayed for the second coming of Messiah, to establish the Kingdom of righteousness, to overthrow sin and to release mankind from its bondage and weakness and from the power of death, and thus to bless the whole earth, restoring all things to the glorious condition represented in miniature in Eden: man in perfection, with a Paradise home.—Acts 3: 19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But as centuries passed without the manifestation of Messiah’s Kingdom, those expectations yielded to another suggestion, namely, that Jesus had not meant what had been understood, but meant that the Church should convert the world, under His supervision, during a period of a thousand years, and that then He would come and give their work His stamp of approval and wind things up by taking all the saintly to heaven, setting fire to the earth to entirely consume it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholics and Protestants Much Confused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Both Catholics and Protestants have been operating in harmony with this erroneous thought. Catholics claim that the Kingdom of Messiah was set up long ago and that the popes and cardinals are representatives of Jesus and the Church. They claim that the Pope is Christ’s Vice-gerent—that is to say, He reigns instead of Christ, as His representative. They claim that “the thousand years” is already in the past, since 1799, and that we are now in the “little season” mentioned in Rev. 20: 3, in which Satan was to </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">loosed, at the close of the thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many Catholics understand that Prot-estanism in general, and, particularly, Socialism and Free Masonry, are organizations of Satan, which will soon be destroyed in the burning up of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Protestants are also much confused on the subject. They claim that we are in the reign of Messiah, but they are not sure when it began or when it will end. Before Luther’s day the Catholic view prevailed, but according to Luther’s preaching the Papal claims were false, and later the Papal system was branded as Antichrist. Since then Protestants are in confusion. Some recognize the Church of England and its kingly head as God’s Kingdom in the earth, but they admit that it has not yet conquered the earth, nor is God’s will done as in heaven, even in the British Isles. The Church of Russia makes a similar claim to being the Kingdom of God, and honors the Pope as the reigning representative of Messiah. Emperor William of Germany also has on his coins the legend that he is reigning &quot;by the grace of God”—that his kingdom is a part of Messiah’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But all these theories Catholics and Protestants are now ignoring. In the light of our day none dare preach such theories. With present-day enlightenment it seems foolish to declare that the various kingdoms of Europe are Messiah’s Kingdom, and that they are establishing a reign of righteousness. The costly preparations for war made by these very nations discredit entirely the claim that they are parts of Messiah’s great Kingdom of righteousness and peace.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“How little mankind figures in the scheme of nature is shown by a rather morose calculation of the Italian Professor Zuccarini, who has figured out, among other things, that estimating the world’s population as 1,500,000,000 the whole human race at present living could stand comfortably shoulder to shoulder in an area of 500 square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Taking the number of generations in the past 6,000 years as 200, the room taken up by them all on the above plan would be only half the size of Germany, or for the sake of comparison, less than the area of the state of Colorado.

How about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If that were true it would merely corroborate Jesus’ words, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own city.” But I fear that I cannot thus claim to be a great teacher, for I have both friends and honor there. The Bible House Congregation, of which I was Pastor for several years, still holds me as its Pastor Emeritus. And I have a standing invitation to come whenever possible. Any Sunday if word were sent I would have a congregation of 600 to 800. And very few Protestant preachers there have so many any time. And few, after being gone for years, would be much more than “remembered.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle </span><span class="font2">is so prejudiced that it sees crowds only when they go to hear its </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ministerial favorites </span><span class="font2">and then it sees double or treble or quadruple.

<p><span class="font2">but unsectarian. Everything found in God’s Book is its creed. Thirty-four ministers are members of the Association at present. Some of these are traveling constantly, addressing Classes of Bible Students, teaching them how to study the Bible most helpfully. Others go out for Sunday meetings in the cities adjacent to New York to instruct similarly. And these latter during the week labor at -the Brooklyn Tabernacle, where we conduct a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Religious Correspondence School. </span><span class="font2">Letters pour in upon us from all parts of the world, in various languages, asking help in the proper understanding of the Holy Scriptures. We have</span></p>

We also handle Bibles and Bible Study helps in various languages, which we supply at wholesale rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These ministers, their wives and children and office helpers live together as one large family of about 100 persons in a comfortable Home. In it each family has its own quarters, but all meet in a large Dining Room for morning worship and at meal times. Frequently visitors drop in for a meal (the Dining Hall is large enough to accommodate 200), and they are made very welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At meal times a leader conducts impromptu Bible Studies on whatever Bible subjects may be submitted. Thus we have a continual Bible School with lessons three times daily. All except children are required before admission to the family to profess </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a full consecration to the will of God </span><span class="font2">as found in the Bible; and additionally to have taken the following:—</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">everything so philanthropic pure, so sensible and so Scrip-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">tural, why do ministers and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle </span><span class="font2">and others hate you and persecute you? And does this extend to all of the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yes, it extends to all, but to me more particularly. I suppose because I am the most conspicuous figure at the front. The reason is the same that led to the persecution of the Apostles and the early church and even put to death the Redeemer. Jesus explains that it is the natural hatred or opposition of Darkness to Light. The purer the Gospel ray the fiercer the opposition! Ignorance, Superstition and Selfishness are behind the persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Still it is hard to understand the lack of ryhme or reason in it all. No minister of any prominent denom- ■ ination would profess to believe his own Church Creed or to defend it. All fiercely denounce sectarianism and call for Christian union. Yet because I show up the errors which they no longer believe they are angry with me. Knowing their doctrinal weakness they dare not contradict me fairly, but content themselves with saying, Pastor Russell is a heretic; he is emptying our churches, and causing a falling off of our revenues. Then they use the cowardly weapons of slander, misrepresentation, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“They Are Quite Mistaken.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">They are quite mistaken regarding the source of their troubles. The falling off of church attendance and their financial stringency has been progressing for </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">thirty </span><span class="font2">years. Their own preaching has done it. Their colleges and seminaries have been teaching Evolution and their Higher Criticism has been undermining all faith in the Bible, until now these things are in the Sunday School Lessons as well as in the Public School Books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus many of the Preachers and their people have lost all confidence in the Bible as God’s Message. The people find no spiritual nourishment in the story that Adam and Eve had monkey parents—that they never were in God’s image, never fell from it, and never needed to be redeemed. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">people, </span><span class="font2">more honest than the preachers, are too honest to pretend a religion which they do not feel and therefore carry their nickles and dimes to the Moving Picture Theatres and feel that they are spending them more honestly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">lized world. A Socialism without the Bible will soon mean a Godless Socialism and that means Anarchy. Surely the wisdom of the wise seems to have perished as the Bible foretold.—Isaiah 29: 13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Self-Conceited?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This was our reporter’s final query. Pastor Bissell replied frankly:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Eagle </span><span class="font2">and all the preachers who are my enemies say that I am. And </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font2">must concede that they have some excuse for so concluding-. I presume they judge me by themselves. If they were in my place they feel sure they would be proud and conceited—if they had invitations from all over the world —if they had written books which in twelve languages are in nearly four million homes—if their weekly' sermons were being regularly published in twelve hundred Newspapers in America and Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But no one realizes more than do I my unworthiness of such success and popularity. God’s providence has favored my humble efforts,! I am as much astonished as my enemies! It is the Message and not the Messenger that is great. It is God’s Message, not mine. As foretold it is “Good tidings of great joy for all people.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">As for publicity: A Newspaper thought that soon the world will be converted; that the second coming of Christ will then take place, and then will come the consummation, and the burning of the world. How strange, how illogical! The heathen, according to reliable government statistics, are twice as numerous today as they were a century ago. Six hundred millions there were then; there are twelve hundred millions now. How long •would it require, at this rate, to convert the world? And if the heathen were converted to the same condition of civilization enjoyed in Europe and America, could we claim then that God’s will was done on earth as it is done in heaven? Assuredly not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thank God, the second coming of Messiah will not dela&gt;y until the world is converted and God’s will full}' done and the plan of salvation ended. Quite to the contrary. His coming is for the very purpose of bringing all things into subjection to the Father’s will. He comes that He may reign as King of kings and Lord of lords, in association with His Church. He will not reign through a representative or vice-gerent, but personally, and “unto </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Him </span><span class="font2">every knee shall bow and every tongue confess,” to the glory of God. In His day the righteous shall flourish, and the evil-doers shall be cut off. The faithful Church, sharing in her Lord’s resurrection, the First Resurrection, to glory, honor and immortality, will be His associate kings and priests, to reign for a thousand years. —Rev. 20: 6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Let us examine some texts which seem to teach that our earth will be destroyed by fire, and note that they are, symbolical. “Fire” is frequently used in the Scriptures as a symbol of destruction. Thus the Church is exhorted to mortify or kill the fleshly nature, and is told that the fiery trials of life will assist them in this work. The opposition of enemies is to be destroyed by works of mercy and kindness, which, figuratively, will be “coals </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of fire </span><span class="font2">upon their heads.” St. Peter mentions special trials and tribulations coming upon the Church, designed to purify her—purge out and destroy the dross. He says: “Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you.”—1. Peter 4: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">St. Paul refers to special trials upon the Church in the end of the Gospel Age, which will consume false doctrines, human traditions, etc., and all false faith, but which will leave unscathed the true Faith and true characters. He says, “If any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man’s work shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of What sort it is. If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.”—I Cor. 3: 12-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These various Scriptures do not prove that the world could not be destroyed by fire in a literal way, but they do prove that “fire” is very frequently mentioned in the Bible in a figurative or symbolical manner. We might multiply the instances: “Our God is a consuming fire”—as regards everything contrary to righteousness; the symbolical “lake of fire,” in the book of Revelation, is explained to signify the Second Death, utter destruction, without hope of recovery.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pastor Russell’s World-Tour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As is generally known Pastor Bussell was chosen as a member of the Committee for the investigation of Foreign Missions. The other members of the Committee are Dr. L. W. Jones, of Chicago; General Hall, of the U. S. Army; Mr. Pyles, of Washington, D. C.; Mr. Kuehn, of Toledo, O; Prof. Robison, of New York, and Mr. Maxwell, of Mansfield, O.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Committee met at the Waldorf Hotel, New York, in September last and outlined its work and elected Pastor Russell its Chairman. Pastor Russell started on the tour December 3d and was joined by other members of the Committee at Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Dallas, Texas. Pastor Russell has promised to be back March 31st next—■ however loqg the others of the Committee may prolong their stay. It is understood that arrangements are under way for a mass meeting at the Hippodrome on Sunday afternoon, March 31st, to hear a report of the Committee.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">World Burning Unscripturai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The supposition that the earth will be destroyed by fire, either soon or ever, would be contrary to the statement that “the earth abideth forever,” and the declaration that God formed it not in vain, but formed it to be inhabited. (Isaiah 45: 18.) One of the very strong passages which seems to teach that the earth will be devoured by fire is found in Zeph. 3: 8, “Wait ye upon Me, saith the Lord, until that Day that I rise up to the prey, for My determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them Mine indignation, even all My fierce anger; for the whole earth shall be devoured with the fire of My jealousy”—anger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That the fire of God’s anger which will come upon the world will not destroy the physical earth, with all its inhabitants, but will destroy the evil of present institutions, is shown by the succeeding sentence, which declares, “Then will I turn to the people a pure Message, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve Him with one consent.” If the fire of this text were literal, the earth and its people would be no more; but as symbolical fire it is perceived that it is a burning against unrighteousness, iniquity, sin, the overthrow of all institutions of evil, and the awakening of mankind and preparing them to hear the Voice of God, the language of the Truth, the Divine Message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What we have seen prepares us for the somewhat more difficult statement of St. Peter: “The Day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burned up. * * * The heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for a New Heavens and a New Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Peter 3: 10-13.) To harmonize these words of St. Peter with other Bible statements, we must consider the “fire” here mentioned to be symbolical. Not only the earth is to be consumed, but the heavens also. The “heavens” will take fire first and be dissolved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What heavens shall we suppose are here referred to?—not the literal, starry heavens, nor even our atmospheric heavens, nor yet the heaven of Divine Presence and glory. The church systems, the ecclesiastical powers, are symbolically referred to as the “heavens,” at the present time, supervising and over-ruling the temporal and social arrangements which are represented by the “earth.” The “earth” represents organized society, as in contrast with the “sea,” which symbolically represents disorganized society, the uncivilized and all who are rebellious against governments. When the “heavens” [ecclesiastical powers] of the present time shall be “dissolved,” it will be with a grrfat noise, with great confusion, commotion. Ecclesiastical institutions of the present time are In a very troubled condition, though they are in no danger of immediate collapse. The principal outcry is that few attend church services, and that the collections are small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">St. Peter’s words indicate a crisis in ecclesiastical affairs still future. The Scriptures show us that a great Federation is seemingly bringing Ecclesi-asticism into greater power than it has exercised in years. Other intimations of Scripture lead us to expect</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">that that federative organization will attempt a rigid control of the world through affiliation with political and civil power, and that a considerable measure of success will lead to intoxication on the subject and an attempt to take away the liberties of the people entirely, the result of which will be a great explosion, or a great “earthquake,” in the symbolical language of Scripture. It will be then that the heavens will take fire and be consumed with a great noise, commotion, disaster, etc. And the commotion will include the social order. The elements will melt with the intensity of the heat, the strife, which will then be engendered. The elements of society are those mutual advantages and assistances of good people, upon which the stability of government rests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Bible clearly intimates that the condition of affairs symbolized by the melting of society and the disintegrating of its elements in the great heat of strife at that time will be the result of superstition and fear. The end will be anarchy, or as the Bible declares, “Every man’s hand will be against his neighbor.” Selfishness will be the predominating, ruling principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Symbolic Fire Useful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The question arises, Why should God permit the fall of our Christian systems, which certainly have done much that is morally assistful to the world? And why should He permit the overthrow of the present order of things, which certainly is much more advantageous than anarchy and disorder? The. Bible answer is that God is not forcing this issue, but is merely allowing mankind to work out these results. The trouble and disaster will come as the natural result of ignoring the principles of Divine Law. Ecclesi-asticism is unauthorized to claim that it is God’s Kingdom, invested with Divine power and authority to rule the world. This fallacious claim and the attempt to enforce it will bring upon it the “fire” which will consume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The world, neglectful of the Golden Rule, and obeying the false standard that “might makes right,” will overthrow society by precipitating a conflict between the two great parties— the capitalists, trusts, kings and princes on the one hand, and labor unions and the masses on the other hand. Each will feel that a death struggle has arrived and that the battle must be fought. Each will feel unwarrantedly self-confident of victory. According to the Bible, the result will be the complete wreck of our present society,</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">SANER VIEWS ON BAPTISM</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were bapized into His Death.&quot;—</span><span class="font1">Rom. 6: 3,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">C</span><span class="font2">HURCH HISTORY shows that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">damnation </span><span class="font2">theories grew gradually. First came the theory that every child of Adam was born damned to eternal torture at the hands of fire-proof devils, and that the only escape was through baptism. But it was claimed that baptism cancelled only previous sins and not subsequent ones; hence it was the custom in Constantine’s time to put off baptism until as near the hour of death as possible. Tertullian is credited with supporting this view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Later came St. Augustine, advancing the theory that only the Church woqld be saved and that baptism was for the purpose of induction into the Church. Naturally it followed that if infants died without being admitted into the Church they would go to eternal torture. As a result of this teaching infant baptism sprang into great popularity, which is still maintained. At first the infants were immersed in water, but later, under the belief that all bishops were successors of the Apostles and equal in authority, Church Councils took the place of the Word of God. They not only sanctioned infant baptism, which is not even mentioned in the Bible, but additionally claimed that immersion was unnecessary and that a few drops of water would induct the aged or the babe into the Church and constitute an insurance against a hell of eternal torture. This theory still persists to perhaps a greater degree than many would imagine. Luther and his coadjutors protested against some of the doctrines of the Church of Rome, but accepted without protest infant baptism, sprinkling, etc., as necessary topreservation from everlasting torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Unbaptized Infants in Torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Someone suggests, “Ah! we practice infant sprinkling, but it is merely a ‘christening.’ * We have no tnought whatever that .the gracious Heavenly Father or His adorable Son, our Redeemer, would consign an infant to torture, even if it died without being christened.” Do not be too sure, brother. Superstitions die hard. We know of a white-haired bishop in the Episcopal Church who was appalled at the very suggestion that his infant grandchild might be safe in the arms symbolically pictured as “fire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But the Lord through the Prophet Zephaniah points out that, following this time of “fire” and trouble, will come a blessing to the earth. So also He declares through St. Peter that, following the symbolic fire, will come “a New Heaven” and a new earthly condition, the basic principle of which will be righteousness; and the Prophet Zephaniah says that then God’s Message, in its purity, shall reach the people. Both statements are true. On the ruins of our present civilization, when mankind will be sick at heart with the failure of what they had considered to be the Brain Age, they will look to the Lord, to whom they should have looked sooner. They will perceive the coming reign of righteousness and will say, “Lo, this is our </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">God, </span><span class="font2">we have waited for Him and He will deliver us.” (Isaiah 25: 9.) Then, the Prophet declares, “The desire of all nations shall come.”—Haggai 2: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All nations are desiring blessing; prosperity, and God desires that all shall have these very favors, and they will be obtainable through Messiah’s Kingdom. Then the blessing of mankind will begin. The Messianic Kingdom, invisible but All-Powerful, will be thoroughly manifest in its dealings and its righteous judgments will have control. The blessing will come through Israel, extending to and including “all the families of the earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How grand the thought that the New Heavens will be the new ecclesiastical powers—the glorified Church— Christ and His Bride in glory and power! The New Earth mentioned by the Apostle will be the new organization of human society, along the lines of righteousness—the Golden Rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have not forgotten our text. What we have said is in line with it. It requires the addition of one word to make its meaning clear. The Mystery of God, which has been kept secret from the foundation of the world, shall be finished, completed, no longer a mystery. “And the angel sware * * * that the time should be no longer [delayed].” (Rev. 10: 6, 7.) This has no reference to the end ol time. Time can never end. Other Scriptures show that we are living very near the finish, the completion of the Church, which is the “Mystery.” (Eph. 3: 3-6; 5: 32.) With the completion of the Church (the “Mystery”) will begin the fulfilment of a’l the glorious promises of the Bible respecting the lifting of the curse from the earth, and the Divine blessing upon all earthly things.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">of Jesus without having </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">been “chris</span><span class="font2">tened.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not only so, but these superstitions of a darker day are forcefully impressed upon the “common people” by </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">some </span><span class="font2">of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">clergy. </span><span class="font2">Let us tell you of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">twe </span><span class="font2">cases:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(1) A Lutheran couple in Pennsylvania had some unpleasantness with their pastor respecting Church </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">dues. </span><span class="font2">This caused them to absent themselves from Church service for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">several </span><span class="font2">months. Meantime their babe </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">became </span><span class="font2">sick. The father humbled himself </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">go to his pastor to tell him of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font2">distress and his fear that the child might die and of his desire to </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font2">it baptized. Imagine the anguish </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the deluded parent when the pastor refused and told him that the child would go to hell and that this </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font2">his desert as a parent because </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">failure to keep in touch with </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font2">Church.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(2) The other case was that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of a </span><span class="font2">Catholic couple in Wisconsin. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Their </span><span class="font2">two little girls died of diphtheria .with-, in a few hours of each other. When the parish priest was sent for he declined to come and refused permission to have the children buried in “holy ground.” The explanation given to the astonished parents was that they had neglected their duty toward </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">children, that they had not been baptized into the Church, and consequently were lost.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">To a friend the bereaved father declared that he wanted to have nothing whatever to do with so unjust a God who would consign his little, innocent children to eternal torture merely because of his sin, his neglect, in not having a few drops of water sprinkled in their faces by the priest! The friend had been reading </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Studies in the Scriptures” </span><span class="font2">and explained to the bereaved father that Church creeds and theories’ are very different from the plain and simple teachings of the Bible. He showed him that his little ones were merely “asleep in Jesus” waiting f&lt;?r the glorious resurrection blessings of restitution, to be brought to mankind at the second coming of Jesus, after the completion of the elect Church and their change to heavenly glory. Could you wonder that that Catholic, * saloon-keeper, received a new ray of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">hope and that it had a transforming influence upon his life?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Christian-Diseiples’ Error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let us examine the doctrine of immersion as set forth by the Christian or Disciple denomination. We have not an unkind word to say respecting the people of this denomination, but we wish to dissect their doctrines, laying bare what we consider to be their inconsistencies, falsities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The texts used by this denomination as proofs that </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">baptism is for the remission of sins </span><span class="font2">were never applied to any except Jews. The Jews were in Covenant-relationship with God through the Mosaic Law. If they got into sin it was proper for them to repent, return to God and use water symbolically, indicating return from sin. All Jews in full harmony with the Law Covenant in Jesus’ day were transferred from Moses to Christ. Only those who had committed special sins were called upon to wash away those sins symbolically in water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Others living consistent lives as “Israelites indeed” were never instructed to be baptized or to wash away their sins. There is no record ef any of the Apostles having been immersed in water for the remission of sins, except St. Paul, and he only because he had persecuted the Church of Christ. The baptism into Christ announced for Gentile converts is wholly different from the Jewish baptism for the remission of sins. An illustration of this is found in Acts 18: 24, 25, where Apollos had baptized certain Gentiles of Ephesus with John’s baptism for the remission of sins. St. Paul afterward declared this incorrect and directed them to be immersed again—not for the remission of sins, but for induction into the Body of Christ, which is the Church. (Acts 19: 1-6.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But the chief point which we make against the Christian-Disciple theory, that Baptism is for the remission of sins, is that it naturally dis-fellowships all Christians who have not been immersed. The logic of this theory would find few supporters in the Christian-Disciple denomination. The logic of it is this: If immersion is necessary for an adult in order that his sins may be remitted or washed away, it would logically follow that all adults not immersed are yet in their sins— unforgiven. And this signifies, according to this theory, that, if they die thus they must suffer the penalty of their sins, which penalty, they say, is eternal torture.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Baptist Theory In Error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let us examine next the Baptist theory of Baptism. It is more nearly in line with the Scriptures than any denominational theory of Baptism held in the world. And yet, remarkably few Baptists today could or do stand by their theory, if put to the test. Nevertheless, in theory and practice, the great mass of Baptists declare that immersion is a necessary incidental to admission to the “Church of the Living God, whose names are written in heaven!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In full keeping with this, in nine out of every ten Baptist Churches the world over, only immersed Christians are ever invited to the communion table to participate in the Lord’s Supper. Why? Because they claim that only immersed persons belong to the true Church and that the communion service is exclusively for the Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If we ask them what are the advantages claimed for membership in the Church, they reply—Salvation! What is the antithesis or opposite of salvation? we ask. They answer—Lost! What do you mean by </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">lost? </span><span class="font2">we inquire. The reply is, To be banished from God and suffer everlasting torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So then, theoretically, our Baptist friends deliver to the unimmersed the Same blood-curdling theory handed out by Christian-Disciples—that Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists, Congregationalists, etc., are enroute for eternal torture. The difference between the two theories is that the Disciples say that this awful fate impends upon the masses of Christendom, as well as upon heathendom, because their sins have not been forgiven, while the Baptists say, No, not for that cause, for Jesus died for all, but because they have not taken the necessary steps to get into the Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Times of Such Ignorance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">St. Paul tells us of certain times </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">ignorance which “God winked at” or disregarded. We believe that the Almighty graciously overlooked such inconsistencies in the theories of some </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">His children and charged them not with the responsibility of so terribly maligning the Divine Character and misrepresenting the Divine Word. But now our God is opening the eyes of our understanding and there is no longer excuse for any to believe such monstrous theories, nor excuse to still profess to believe them after they have been repudiated by the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The true view of Baptism is one which cannot be controverted. It </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font2">consistent with itself and with every</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">Bible statement. It recognizes every consecrated child of God of every denomination, or outside of all denominations. It inducts the saintly Baptist, saintly Disciple, saintly Catholic, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Congregationalist, Methodist, etc., into membership in the “one Church of the Living God, whose names are written in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What Baptism can this be? We reply that it is the one mentioned by St. Paul, in a text which we have all read and quoted time and again: “So many of you as were baptized </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">into Jesus Christ </span><span class="font2">were baptized </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">into His death.” </span><span class="font2">(Rom. 6: 3.) The mistake we have all made in the past is in applying the Apostle’s words to </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">water baptism. </span><span class="font2">The Apostle said not a word about water baptism, but mentioned specifically the Baptism into Christ, into “the Body of Christ, which is the Church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The thought is that God has ordained the gathering of the elect Church during the Gospel Age. The Head of this Church was received up into glory eighteen centuries ago, and since Pentecost one and another of the true footstep followers of Jesus have been accepted of God through His merit and counted as “members of the Body of Christ, which is the Church.” First, Jewish believers were transferred from Moses into Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Next the Message was extended to the Gentiles. But these could not pass from Moses into Christ because they were not in Moses, never having come under the Law Covenant arrangement. Hence, these could come into Christ only by direct baptism. All baptized into Jesus Christ occupy a specially, preferred relationship to God and, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font2">faithful to the end, will be received to glory, honor and immortality on the spirit or heavenly plane. But there is not a word of Scripture to say that the world, which misses this glorious exaltation, will on this account suffer eternal torture. They will lose the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font2">prize, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Water Baptism Not the Door Into the True Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our Baptist friends will agree to the above statement. They will say. Yes, that is what we mean, only, in order to be in Christ, we Baptists claim </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">water </span><span class="font2">immersion is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are glad to have their plain, candid statement and to meet the issue squarely. That is the Baptist mistake —-supposing that water baptism inducts anybody into membership in the true Church. They may indeed make </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">water </span><span class="font2">immersion the door into the Baptist Church, but this does not make it the door into “the Church of the Living God.” St. Paul defines the Baptism by which any Gentile may come into membership in the Body of Christ. Note his words again: “So many of you as were baptized </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">into Jesus Christ </span><span class="font2">were baptized </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">into His death.” </span><span class="font2">Our Baptist friends think of this as though it read “were baptized in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">water.” </span><span class="font2">This is their mistake, as before stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But the question arises, Just what is meant by these words, “Baptized </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">into His death?” </span><span class="font2">Was </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">His </span><span class="font2">death in any way different from the death of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">others? </span><span class="font2">Most decidedly it was! Our race die as sinners, children of wrath, under Divine sentence of death. But Jesus was not a sinner and hence was not under Divine sentence of death. He was “holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners” and free from Adamic death. His death was a sacrificial one—a surrender of an unimpaired life. Those, therefore, who would become His footstep followers and be baptized into His death, must participate with Him in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">sacrificial </span><span class="font2">death. The Scriptures explain that this would be impossible except as those footstep followers should be cleansed and made acceptable sacrifices through the merit of Jesus, because “by nature we were all children </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">wrath, even as others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Death </span><span class="font2">was the real meaning of our</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Lord’s baptism. John the Immerser knew that Jesus was not a sinner, knew that He had no sins to wash away, and at first he declined to immerse Him. And he did so only after Jesus had assured him that it vVas right and that the matter had a deeper significance. “Suffer it to be so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Lord’s Baptism Finished at Calvary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our Lord for three and a half years was carrying out the consecration vow which in Jordan He symbolized—baptism into death. Day by day He became more deeply immersed into death. That real immersion into death was finished on Calvary. In harmony with this the day before His death Jesus said, “I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened until it be accomplished.” The. next day it was accomplished, when He cried, “It</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font2">is finished!” His baptism into death was finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same thought the Master gave to His followers, saying to two who desired places on His right and His left in the Kingdom: “Ye know not what ye ask!” You do not know what it requires to secure exaltation to the Kingdom. Are you able, are you willing to drink of My cup of sorrow, self-denial, etc.? Are you willing “to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with”—the baptism into </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">death? </span><span class="font2">When the disciples replied that they were willing, the Master assured them that He would attend to the rest. The terms of discipleship have not changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Just a word further respecting water baptism. It has its place, not in keeping any out of eternal torment, nor in</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Yes, I noticed the Reverend gentleman’s statement. His presentation of Baptism followed my lines quite well. I am glad of it. He merely corroborated my declaration that “remarkably few Baptists of today could or do stand by their theory if put to the test.” This I mentioned as complimentary to Baptists—as indicating that they, like the remainder of Christendom, are in advance of their creeds formulated in the darker period. But now to be frank, I must say something less complimentary and that is that the Baptists who hold the more advanced, enlightened views are quite in the minority and to be found chiefly in the large cities of the North. The majority of Baptists in the South style themselves “hard shells” and will not give an inch. I never attack Christian men and women, but respect the religious liberties of all. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font2"> do attack the God-dishonoring creeds of the Dark Ages which so confused our forefathers as to lead them to persecute one another, even to burning </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font2"> the stake. Yet, even in attacking those creeds which have so long and so injuriously divided the one Church of the Living God into six hundred sects, I always adhere to the Truth and prefer to understate rather than to exaggerate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I will cite you to Baptist authorities on the subject of Baptism and Church membership—not, however, with a view to proving what the more advanced Baptists of today believe, but to prove that they are advanced and that their creeds need revision so as to agree more nearly with the views of advanced Baptists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Reverend Huntley is quoted as declaring that the “Baptist Church is an entirely different thing from the Church of the Living God whose names are written in heaven.” This is exactly what I hold, namely, that the Baptist Church is not </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">Church, but merely one of the many sects, each of which used to claim to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">Church and used to roast each other as heretics. Baptists generally are not so frank. They generally claim that there is only one true Church of Christ, entered by the door of water immersion. Now compare this with the quotation from “The Star Book on Baptist Polity.” It declares, “A Church is the body of Christ in its relation to Him as the Head.” It is the “spiritual temple,” as being composed of spirit or regenerated members, thus distinguished from all worldly “organizations.” (Page 28.) “Persons may become members of the Church by Baptism.” (Page 36.) “No person can properly be received into membership in the Church unless having thus been baptised; and as baptism must precede actual Church membership, so it must</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">THE ROBE OF CHRIST’S RIGHTEOUSNESS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font2">HE “WEDDING GARMENT” mentioned in the Lord’s parable (Matt. 22:2-14), is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Robe of Justification, </span><span class="font2">which becomes ours at the time of consecration. At the very moment of our begettal, when the Lord accepted us, we became probationary members of the Body of Christ, the Bride Class, and were covered with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Wedding Robe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This “wedding garment” is given, not to the Old Creature, but to the New Creature, to cover the blemishes of its imperfect body. At the moment of God’s acceptance of our sacrifice and of the begetting of the Holy Spirit, the New Creature is reckoned as coming into existence and as wearing this robe. Thenceforth, the Old Creature, from the Divine viewpoint, is nonexistent—“Old things are passed away; all things are become new.” (2 Cor. 5:17.) But this New Creature must have a new body. The New Creature has the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">old body, </span><span class="font2">but a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">new will—</span><span class="font2">the getting them into eternal glory; but it is a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">symbol, </span><span class="font2">a beautiful </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">picture </span><span class="font2">in one act. It is a testimony to all believers that the consecrated one has vowed loyalty to the Redeemer—even unto death. As such a confession, of such a consecration, we commend water baptism to you all as being the Lord’s own provision of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">pictorial </span><span class="font2">confession for those who have accepted His terms and surrendered their &quot;all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As for the unconsecrated world, it is fitting that they should not be baptized. Baptism was never intended except for the fully consecrated, the sanctified in Christ Jesus. Wnen God’s due time shall come the world of mankind will receive the blessings provided for them through the Redeemer’s merit, under the gracious arrangement of that Redeemer’s heavenly Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">precede all privileges of Church membership.” (Page 31.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We quote from a Baptist standard publication, “A Catechism of Bible Teaching,” as follows: “Why ought Baptists not to take the Lord’s Supper with believers of other denominations?” Answer, “Because we think they have not been baptised.” (Page 34.) “The action performed in Christian Baptism is immersion in water.” (Page 32.) “Can there be Christian Baptism without immersion?” Answer, “No.” (Page 33.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What do these statements mean, if they do not signify that Baptism is the door into the “spiritual temple” as distinguished from all worldly organizations and that only water immersion is Baptism? Now let us see respecting the fate of believers and unbelievers—the Church, the spiritual temple, entered by water Baptism, as in contradistinction to others not thus saved. We quote as follows from the “Baptist Catechism,” answer No. 41: “At the resurrection believers (above explained to be immersed persons) being raised up in glory shall be openly acknowledged and acquitted.” Answer No. 42: “The souls of the wicked at their death shall be cast into the torments of hell.” Answer No. 43: “The bodies of the wicked being raised out of their grave shall be sentenced with their souls to unspeakable torments with the Devil and his angels forever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As Baptist Doctrine makes no allowance for any but two classes, every human being is to be expected to share one or the other of these described fates. The blissful estate is for the saintly, immersed Baptist and, so far as the statement shows, for no others. All others, therefore, appear to be treated under the head of wicked— disobedient neglecters of immersion at least. That Baptists do not recognize the unimmersed Christians as being of the Church of Christ is manifest from their refusal to partake with them of the Lord’s Supper, which they recognize as being only for the true Church, the “spiritual temple.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Rev. Huntley has stolen a march on his Baptist friends by declaring the Baptist Church merely one of a number of sects and not the “spiritual temple” of “The Star Book of Baptist Church Polity.” (Page 28.) It is for this reason that we declare that the Reverend gentleman has come over to our position on the subject of immersion. Evidently he now sees as we teach, not as Baptists generally see— that the saintly people of all denominations will in glory constitute the Bride, the Lamb’s Wife and joint-heir in Christ’s Kingdom. It is our hope also that the gentleman may ultimately see that the glorified Messiah and His Bride are to reign for a thousand years for the blessing, uplifting and restoration to human perfection of whosoever will of the non-elect world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">will of Christ. </span><span class="font2">The Apostle tells </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">us </span><span class="font2">that we should not be satisfied with merely reckoning ourselves </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">dead </span><span class="font2">according to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">flesh, </span><span class="font2">but that we should reckon ourselves as having been </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">made alive </span><span class="font2">in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Spirit. </span><span class="font2">If the Spirit of Christ be in us, it will quicken our mortal bodies—vivify them.—Rom. 8:8-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These mortal bodies, then, which were under the influence of the old imperfections and under the old course of life, have now, under the new mind, a restraining, or constraining influence put upon them and the New Creature is expected to use the new mind, or will, to overcome the desires of the flesh. While in this body of flesh, the New Creature is expected to demonstrate such faithfulness in the development of character that he may be accounted worthy of being raised in the First Resurrection as a Divine being. •Having this </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">imperfect body, </span><span class="font2">he needs the robe of Christ’s righteousness </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">cover his imperfections.</span></p>

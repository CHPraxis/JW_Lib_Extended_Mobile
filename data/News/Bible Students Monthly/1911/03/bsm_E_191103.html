<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MINISTER ATTACKS ORTHODOX BELIEF</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The ordinary orthodox minister snakes out that God is less just, less loving and less merciful than the people who worship Him, if you pick up a man in the street he deserves more respect and admiration than the brute-iike God worshipped by the orthodox church, which believes in eternal damnation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hearty applause greeted this expression made from the pulpit by the Rev. I)r. John H. Dietrich, pastor of the St. Mark’s Memorial Reformed Church, North Highland avenue. Dr. Dietrich's congregation gave vent to its feelings fey applauding his attack on the idea ©f eternal punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Continuing along the same line of thought and dwelling on the way in -which the orthodox church speaks of God as being blasphemous, Dr. Dietrich said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Its members give to Him who is supposed to be all-wise, all-powerful and all-loving, attributes which impeach His character and make Him a Being not only unworthy of worship tout unworthy of respect. I hope you -will pardon me for speaking thus ve-liemently; my only reason is that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">want to save the name of our Father, whom I love, admire and worship, from the blasphemy of those who woifld make Him such a brute as to eternally ifl.gmn His children.”—Pittsburg Chron-Ic’ie-Telegraph. *</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font4">.assaults of succeeding generations for thousands of years! Thus has it been -with the Word of God during all its history. Men have made it their ene</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">rgy </span><span class="font4">by their bad lives, and then have </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">become </span><span class="font4">its enemies and Jiated it, and •Sought to destroy it. ** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehoiakim, as we|read, cut tQ^oiec'es </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">Divine Roll, and tlw&amp;w ft into the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">-fire. </span><span class="font4">About 170 years before Christ, Antiochus caused all the copies ^»f the Jewish Scriptures to be burned. Three hundred and three years after, Dio-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">what wonder should we gaze fortress that had withstood tho cletian, by an edict, ordered all the {Scriptures to be committed to the flames; and Eusebius, the historian, tells us he saw large heaps of them burning in the market place.- Nor has this spirit ever failed to show itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible has, all along its course, liad to struggle against opposition, -visible and latent, artful and violent. Jt has had to contend with the prevalence of error, the tyranny of passion, •and the cruelty of persecution. Numerous foes have risen up against it— some, who have aimed to destroy it, ■others who have striven to monopolize it, and ungodly men, who .have hated It for its purity and its penalties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But from all these assaults it has been preserved. It has survived the shocks of all its enemies, and withstood the ravages of ’time. The very monuments of man’s power have been -converted into the mockery of his weakness. His eternal cities moulder </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">their ruins, and the serpent hisses </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">the cabinet where he planned his </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">■empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yet, notwithstanding all this desolation, the stream which first bubbled up at the foot of the Eternal Throne has continued to roll on with .silent majesty and might, bearing down •each opposing barrier, and declaring </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">perishing multitudes' on its brink, that, while “all flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass, the Word of the Lord endureth forever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No weapon that has ever been formed against the Bible has prospered. It has survived the power of secret treachery and open violence. The time Ihas been when to read it was death. Infidelity has fought against it with relentless malignity, but it has successfully resisted all its potency. The identical press, indeed, which was employed by Voltaire and the French Institute </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font4">•disseminate their attacks upon the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible, has since been used to print the very volume they so vainly sought to destroy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus has the Word of the &quot;Lord lived </span><span class="font4">and triumphed. Portions of it were written thousands of years' ago. Whole libraries of works have perished, of much more modern date. Never was book more bitterly hated. Most malevolent efforts have been put forth for its annihilation. Kings and emperors and generals, philosophers, statesmen, and legislators, have all aimed at its extirpation. Yet has it flourished, while its adversaries have been blasted one after another.—Alfred Nevin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">♦ ♦ *</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great Adversary’s latest attack is through creedal misrepresentations on the one hand and “Higher Criticism” and Evolution theory on the other hand. Only the few really understand it; because “The secret of the Lord is with them that reverence Him, and He will show them His Covenant.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>BAPTISTS ENDORSE HIGHER CRITICISM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Amongst the most staunch adherents to the Bible are the Baptists. It, therefore, caused all the more astonishment that at their Convention in Canada they endorsed Higher Criticism—Infidelity. In their Toronto Educational Institution the Bible and its so-called Higher Critics had a contest. When the decision went against the Eible, an appeal was made to the Convention. The Convention upheld Higher Criticism in its endorsement of the continued teaching of Higher Criticism in Baptist Theological Schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">'rof auout twenty^ears iiigrfer</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘CTu </span><span class="font4">icism has been taking a more and more pronounced stand in all the Baptist Theological Seminaries, as well as in all other Protestant Seminaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The surprising thing about the proceedings of the Convention is that this brand of infidelity has gained such strength and such courage that it is willing to announce itself publicly to the whole world as Anti-Biblical. Here we see reflected what we have fOT some years been pointing out, A^mely, that all the young ministers </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">'of</span><span class="font4"> all denomina-tfohs are being graduated as Higher Critics, Infidels, with exactly the same view of the Bible as Robt. Ingersoll and Thos. Paine held and advocated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The only difference is that these young ministers pose as Christians and belivers in a personal God and in His revelation of His character and Plan in the Bible, whereas they are totally unbelievers. Christianity is losing its hold when its very foundation is laughed at by its most prominent representatives. He who disbelieves the Bible record of Adam and Eve and the fall must also disbelieve any necessity for a redemption f the fallen race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who believe that Adam fell upward, instead of downward, cannot have sympathy or appreciation for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">words of the </span><span class="font4">Master, that He came to seek and to recover that which was lost. They do not believe that we were redeemed by the precious blood of Christ. They totally deny the Master’s own words that He came into the world to give Himself a ransom-price, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">corresponding offset, for human sin and condemnation. What Gospel have such ministers to preach and how few ministers there are in any denomination that are not Higher Critics—Infidels? . The remainder are classed as old fogies and are not in demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus we see fulfilling before our eyes the Master’d words, “When the Son of Man cometh, shall He find faith in the earth?” The faith once delivered to the saints is certainly not very generally held to-day, even amongst those who profess to be the special advocates, mouthpieces and champions of true religion. ■</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font9">Do You Believe in the Resurrection of theDead?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;He preached unto them Jesus and the Resurrection.” (Acts 17:18.) &quot;And when they heard of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Resurrection of the dead some mocked. &quot;&nbsp;(Acts 17:32.) If there be no Resurrection of the dead, . . . then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain; . . .then is not Christ raised, and . . . ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fallen asleep in Christ are perished. ” — I Cor. 15:13-18.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">W</span><span class="font4">HEN we remember that the word “resurrection” is used no less than thirty-seven times in the New Testament, besides various other words of similar import; and when we remember that all the prominent creeds of Christendom declare £aith in a resurrection as an integral and essential part of Scriptural doctrine and of the hope of eternal life—in view of these facts, and of the strong language of the texts above quoted, whose inspiration is conceded by all Christians, it may seem strange that we should ask any Christian the question, Do you believe in the resurrection of the dead?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nevertheless, we have serious reason to doubt that a belief in the resurrection of the dead prevails amongst Christians to any considerable extent; and it is because we believe the resurrection to be a very important doctrine in its connection with other doctrines of Scripture (throwing light upon other doctrines), that we dpsire to call general attention to this subject and to invite an examination of our question in the light of facts and of Scripture; our hope being that after a careful examination of the subject many more of God’s people will come to believe—consistently, logically, Scripturally—in a resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">’KesurrecObn Rarely chosen </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">now</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> AS a Subject for Sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Like priest, like people,” is an old adage, which implies that the views of the teaching or clerical class on any subject may safely be considered an index to the views of their .parishioners. It is not difficult to ascertain the views of the clergy of all denominations on the subject of the resurrection of the dead; for, although that topic is rarely chosen for discourse, except upon Easter Sunday, it is, nevertheless, indissolubly attached to every funeral service; and these numerous occasions, we believe, amply justify us in the statement that both the clergy of all denominations and their people have little or no faith in a resurrection of the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">True, it is customary on every funeral occasion to read the words of the Apostle Paul, in which he sets forth the resurrection as the Christian’s hope (I Cor. 15), but this seems to be a mere concession on the part of the officiating minister. He feels it to be his duty to read something on the subject, but his remarks following the reading prove most conclusively that, so far from believing that the person whose corpse is about to be buried is dead, he believes, and instructs his hearers that thev should believe that their friend and neighbor is “more alive than he ever was.” Frequently, indeed, he plays directly into the hands of the “Spiritualists” and “Christian Scientists,” by telling the audience that the spirit of their dead friend is with them in the room, hovering over them; and that if permitted to speak he would say to them, “Dry your tears; weep not for me; I am far better oft in glory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">To Many Death Has Become a Delusion and Not a Reality</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Indeed, it has come to be the general belief among Christian people that death is a delusion, and not a reality; that people merely seem to die, and do not die; that they merely experience a change to a higher form of being;., that so-called “Christian Scientists” are quite correct in saying, “There is no death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whoever holds such views does not, cannot consistently believe in “tho resurrection of the dead;” because if </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font4">one is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">dead, </span><span class="font4">how can there be a resurrection of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">dead? </span><span class="font4">Wherein would be the sense in speaking of a resurrection of the dead to life, if they already have life more abundantly than they possessed it before they </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">seemingly </span><span class="font4">died?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But thousands of ministers would </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">answer us, </span><span class="font4">saying, “When speaking of the resurrection, we merely mean at resurrection of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">body—</span><span class="font4">the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">bodies </span><span class="font4">which we bury are all to come forth again from the grave, and the spirits which parted from them in death </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font4">to be rehabilitated in those bodies </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">the resurrection. This is what we mean by resurrection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">•Well, well! </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Who would have sup</span><span class="font4">posed such inconsistency </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on the part </span><span class="font4">of so many learned and well-meaning men! Before taking up the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Scriptural </span><span class="font4">side of the question, to show that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">such </span><span class="font4">expectations are at variance with tha Scripture teaching, let us examine </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tha </span><span class="font4">proposition of these ministers </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in the light of its own inconsistency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Consistency, Thou Art a Jewel.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1) They tell us that the deceased </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4">“far better off,” in that he has gotten free from the “fetters of the flesh,” and that now “his free spirit wings its flight </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">God, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font4">longer hampered </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">hindered by the mortal dust.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">They go </span><span class="font4">into ecstasies in describing </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">grandeur and liberty and blessedness! of the one who has died, and who, by reason of getting rid of the body, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font4">attained to life more abundant, knowledge a hundredfold, and blessings indescribable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) In th&gt;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">tiie Scriptures referring to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">resur</span><span class="font4">rection and (wholly misconstruing those Scriptures) tell us that by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">by, at the second coming of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord </span><span class="font4">Jesus Christ, the same bodies </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of flesh </span><span class="font4">that were buried will be reorganized (Dr. Talmage, in his famous resurrec</span><span class="font3">tion </span><span class="font4">sermon pictured the resurrection morning, and the entire sky </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">darkened </span><span class="font4">with the fragments of human </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">bodies </span><span class="font4">coming together from various parts of the earth, where a finger, a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">foot, or a </span><span class="font4">hand had been lost by accident, disease </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font4">amputation); they tell us </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4">then the spirit beings which, they say, left those bodies at death, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font4">return to them, as their everlasting habitations. Then, inasmuch </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">as the </span><span class="font4">resurrection is Scripturally set </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">forth to </span><span class="font4">be the grand and glorious result </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">consummation of our salvation, they feel compelled to go into ecstasies </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">over </span><span class="font4">their erroneous presentation of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">resurrection, and to tell how </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">glorious </span><span class="font4">and grand will be the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Man 50 Would Be Sadly Handicapped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They seem to overlook entirely </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">inconsistency of these two propositions; and they expect that their hear</span><span class="font3">ers </span><span class="font4">will be similarly inconsistent and illogical (and apparently their expectations are fully justified, for the majority of their hearers swallow the inconsistency without difficulty); yea, many of them seem to think that the more inconsistent and unreasonable their belief may bo, the more reason they have to congratulate themselves that they have a very strong </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">faith. How</span><span class="font4">ever, the real fact is that they have a very strong credulity. But they will have </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font4">reward' for believing </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">unrea</span><span class="font4">sonable things which God’s Word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font4">not taught, but has contradicted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Who cannot see, if he will, that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">man who dies fifty years old, if </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">dying he obtains life more </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">abundant </span><span class="font4">and knowledge a hundredfold, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and a </span><span class="font4">freedom to “wing his flight,” etc., would be sadly disappointed by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">resurrection—if it should mean to him reimprisonment in a tenement of clay, with physical restrictions and human limitations? And then, if he had thus for centuries been a “free spirit,” roaming at liberty throughout the Universe, untrammeled by a body </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">bodily limitations, where would be the consistency on God’s part of reimprisoning such an one in a human body, whose powers and uses would be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">en</span><span class="font4">tirely forgotten during those centuries of liberty? And if to be without </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">body is “perfect bliss,” as the funeral orators tell, how could there be anything added to perfect bliss bv a resurrection of the body, and a reincarceration therein?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">i </span><span class="font4">From the foregoing’ considerations We feel that we are justified in our assumption that the vast majority of Christian people do not believe in a Insurrection—neither the Scriptural ’feind (“a resurrection of the dead”), nor in tflie kind they themselves teach, namely, a resurrection of the body. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Scriptures Hold Out the Only</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Hope, the Blessed Hope, the Consistent Hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With this preface to our subject we </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">go </span><span class="font4">to the Scriptures to learn from </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">them </span><span class="font4">what is meant by “the resurrec</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tion of </span><span class="font4">the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">dead,” </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">what manner </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">why the Scriptures speak of the resurrection as the hope, the only </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">[hope, </span><span class="font4">the blessed hope, not only of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">Lord’s people, who are to have part in the “first resurrection,” but of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">world in general, who are to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font4">an opportunity to share in the resurrection of judgment, improperly translated, “the resurrection of damnation.”—John 5:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whoever would believe the Scriptural ifloctrine of the resurrection must also believe the Scriptural doctrine respect</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font4">death—that death is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">death, the </span><span class="font4">cessation of life. Then, and not until </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">then, </span><span class="font4">will he be able to understand the Apostle’s words in our text, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“If there be no resurrection of the dead, . . . then they which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nor is this statement by the great Apostle Paul an exception to or indif</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ferent </span><span class="font4">from the teaching of the Scriptures elsewhere. Their unanimous testimony is that the dead ar dead; </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4">“in that very day their thougats perish.” (Psa. 146:4.) Of the dead thi Scriptures further declare, “His sons </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">come </span><span class="font4">to honor and he knoweth it not; </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">dishonor, and he perceiveth it not </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">©f </span><span class="font4">them;” “for there is neither wisdom, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">nor </span><span class="font4">knowledge, nor device in the grave whither thou goest.”—Job 14:21; Eccl. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Sb* 10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fered </span><span class="font4">according to the Divine penalty for sin pronounced against our race—-“Dying thou shaft die.” The oppo^ers take up with Satan’s delusive statement to Mother Eve, “Ye shall not surely die,” and attempt to prove that the dead are not dead; that God’s penalty against sin </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">did not go into effect, </span><span class="font4">and that death, so far from being the sentence o&lt;r curse upon our race, is a blessing, a step in a general process of evolution. The two theories are as far apart as the poles, and the two teachers of these two theories, as we have shown, are God, on the one hand, and Satan, “a liar from the beginning,” on the other hand. Which shall we believe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The entire Plan of Salvation is connected with this question. If </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">death </span><span class="font4">was not the penalty of sin, incurred through Adam, then </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“'life </span><span class="font4">and that more abundant” is not the reward and blessing of God secured through Christ by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a resurrection. </span><span class="font4">Satan’s proposition, ■which has been so widely accepted by the Lord’s people, and which exercises so blinding an influence upon their minds, is the reversal, in every sense </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the word, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the Divine proposition that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">death </span><span class="font4">is the curse or penalty </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">sin; that Christ died to release man from, this sentence or curse, and that the release comes by the resurrection of the dead, who otherwise '.would never have future life, as says the Apostle in our text. Satan’s theory declares death a blessing which brings the fulness of life and liberty and joy, and would make of the resurrection a cur.se, bringing imprisonment and difficulty and restriction and pain and trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Apostle Preached Jesus and the Resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No wonder that, blinded by this deception of the Adversary, the majority of the great theologians of Christendom—and rapidly their many followers—are leaving the doctrine of the Atonement, which declares that “as by a man [Adam] came death, so also by a man [the man Christ Jesus] comes the resurrection of the dead; that as all in Adam die, even so all in Christ shall be made alive.—I Cor. 15:21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the reality of death is denied, it is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font4">more unficult to deny the reality of sin. If it is claimed that Father Adam was not created in the image and likeness of God, but was created a very close image and likeness of the monkey, it follows that in that low condition of intelligence he was unfit for trial for eternal life; and it is only a further step to deny that ho </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ever </span><span class="font4">had </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">trial, and that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">he ever </span><span class="font4">failed and fell from grace. And if the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fall </span><span class="font4">is denied, and, instead, the claim is put forward that man has really been advancing even to the present time— losing his likeness </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to the </span><span class="font4">monkey and gaining in likeness to God, then it will be consistent also </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">take the next step, and declare that since man did not fall he did not need </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font4">redeemed from the fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And hence, with all such reasoning upon false Scriptural basis, it appears logical to deny the oft-repeated declaration of God’s Word, that our Lord Jesus is our Redeemer, and that “He is the propitiation for our sins [the Church’s sins], and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world,” giving for us, as our ransom or corresponding price, His own life, that He might buy back the forfeited life of Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font4">thus see that the leading lights </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Christendom today, repudiate both </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Of </span><span class="font4">the cardinal features of the Gospel, which the Apostle preached of old: &quot;‘He preached Jesus and the resurrection”—Jesus as the Redeemer of mankind from sin and its curse—death—-and the resurrection as the grand re</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sult of </span><span class="font4">that redemptive work, by -which the blessing secured by the Ransom-sacrifice will be made applicable to and available for whosoever wills to accept eternal life upon the terms of this Age. We are reminded here of our Lord’s own words- respecting unbelief </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font4">the present time: He says, “When the Son of Man cometh, shall Fie find the faith on the earth?”—Luke 18:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Five Senses in Full Accord with the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scripture declarations respecting death are in full accord with the testimony of the five senses given us as men by our Creator; and this is what we should expect, though we Should be ready to admit the possibility of our senses being in error if the Divine revelation contradicts our senses. But wheit our senses are contradicted by a human theory, contrary to Scriptural statements, the theory should be rejected and the testimony of the senses held to be true; and when the Scriptures and our senses together unite in one testimony, it is certainly wrong to hold to a theory of human dissolution, which is contradicted by Divine revelation and by our own senses as well. And whoever thus repudiates his God-given (though sin-imparred) senses and the Divine testimony, need expect nothing else than </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">♦•o </span><span class="font4">be led into darkness and stumbling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today, as eighteen centuries ago, the blind are leading the blind into the ditch of unbelief and error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“As Dieth the One, So Dieth the Other; They Have All One</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Breath.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The testimony of our senses, like the testimony of God’s Word, is that death means the loss of life, and not an increase of llhe. Watch the dying one and note his weakening powers, mental and physical, until the spark of life becomes extinct. You have seen nothing go from him, you have heard nothing but the death-rattle; you have felt the gradual cessation of the pulse, and noted the gasping for breath; and all of your senses which you can exercise upon the subject tell you that your friend, your loved one, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is dead—</span><span class="font4">alive no longer. You look about you and study the subject and inquire of others, “What next?” The answer to your senses is, “The next thing is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">corruption; </span><span class="font4">when the spark of life has gone the corpse must be buried; ‘dust to dust, ashes to ashes.’ ” You note the similarity between the death of your friend and loved one and the death of the brute beast, and your senses can discern no difference between them; and the Scriptures declare, “As dieth the one, so dieth the other; they have all one [spirit of life] breath.”—Eccl, 3:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But with a longing for a future life, implanted in your nature by our Creator, you inquire, Is there no hope; hath a man no pre-eminence above a beast? The Scriptures answer your question, assuring us that, physically speaking, man “hath no pre-eminence above a beast.” But the Scriptures assure us that although mankind is not; possessed of any power of life beyond that of the beast, the Creator has, nevertheless, made a provision for man that He did not make for the beast; and that provision is the very thing for which we long, namely, everlasting life. The Scriptures point out to us that this provision for man’s everlasting life was made by the Lord in the beginning—not by implanting a deathless quality in the man’s constitution, but by providing in the lifesustaining trees of the Garden of Eden, the means of continuing his life everlastingly; nevertheless, this provision was conditional, dependent upon man’s obedience to his Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures point out that man’s disobedience brought upon him the sentence of death, and that the execution of that sentence was effected by driving him out of the Garden and away from the life-sustaining fruit of its trees. Thus driven out, the sentence, “Dying, thou shalt die,” took effect upon Father Adam gradually, and he lived out nearly to the end of the first thousand-year day. His posterity, becoming weaker and weaker as generations rolled by, are to-day (notwithstanding the many advancements in science, and medicine and sanitary arrangements), reduced to an average of about thirty-five years—“and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow” and they are soon “cut off from the land of tlm living,” to go into “the land of the enemy”—into the great prison-house of death, in which it is estimated that over twenty thousand millions of our race are already—• “where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.”—Job 3:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Jeeus Died, the Just for the Unjust.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures answer our inquiries respecting the dead. While assuring us of the justice of the Divine sentence of death, they nevertheless declare that our Creator is a God cf mercy and of pity, and that when there was no eye to pity and no arm to deliver us, His Arm brought salvation to us. The Scriptures, moreover, point out to us the Lord Jesus Christ as the Arm of Jehovah, stretched down for our relief from sin and sickness and pain and trouble, and for our deliverance from the prison-house of death, and for our restoration to the liberties and privileges of sons of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was in harmony with this Divine sympafhy that, in due time, God sent His only begotten Son into the world, for our redemption—to give for us tho ransom-price, and ultimately to recover all who will accept of Divine me cy, from all the consequences of the fah by a resurrection from the dead. But Divine Love could not make void Divine Justice; it was necessary that God should be just,,if He would be the justifier of them that believe in Jesus; hence the demands of Justice—the penalty for sin—must be paid by our Redeemer, before the work of release and restitution could begin. And here we have the best of evidence respecting what is the penalty of sin, and what </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is not; </span><span class="font4">because, since our Lord Jesus pays for us the just penalty of sin, what He laid down for us will prove what was the penalty against us. What did He do for us? The Scriptures answer: He laid down His </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">life </span><span class="font4">for us; “He </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">died </span><span class="font4">for our sins;” “He </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">died, </span><span class="font4">the Just for the unjust;” “He poured out His soul unto </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">death;” </span><span class="font4">He “made His soul an offering for [our] sin,” and “by</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>His stripes we are healed.”—Rom. 6:8; I Pet. 3:18; Isa. 53:4, 6, 10.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Nothing is more evident than </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4">our Lord Jesus did not suiter </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">an eter</span><span class="font4">nity of torment as the price of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">our re</span><span class="font4">demption; and hence, if the matter needed proof we have here the proof that eternal torment was not the penalty for our sins. On the contrary,, the fact that our Lord Jesus </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">died for </span><span class="font4">our sins, and that the Heavenly Father accepted of that sacrifice </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">His life on our behalf, proves that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font4">was </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">our lives </span><span class="font4">that were forfeited </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font4">sin; that the full penalty of the Divina Law against us as a race was the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font4">privation </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of life. </span><span class="font4">The whole </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">raee<sub>p </sub></span><span class="font4">under sentence of death, has </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">gona </span><span class="font4">down to the great prison-house </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">death—the grave, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sheol, hades. </span><span class="font4">And </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sa </span><span class="font4">our dear Redeemer, when He gave </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">up </span><span class="font4">His life for us, went also to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sheol, hades, </span><span class="font4">the grave. He took our </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">place; </span><span class="font4">and suffered for us the penalty for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font4">sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font4">Jesus’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">death </span><span class="font4">ransoms </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">man </span><span class="font4">from the 'sentence of death, so His resurrection from death became </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">assurance of the justification of all </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font4">accept and obey Him. The Heavenly Father gave evidence that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ran</span><span class="font4">som price was entirely satisfactory; and our Lord, who was thus obedient, to the Father, was raised from the dead and, as the Father’s Agent and Representative, will soon begin the work: of blessing the entire world redeemed by His precious blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Prison-House of Death to B* Opened and the Prisoners</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Set Free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The blessing of the world means </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">breaking open of the prison-house </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">the setting at liberty of the captives, who for six thousand years have been going into the prison-house of death. For this reason our Lord is called the-Life-giver, because His great work will be to give back life to the world of mankind, who lost life in Adam, And since the restoration of life tc mankind will mean the removal of pains and sicknesses and troubles,, which are a part of the dying process^ our Redeemer is styled the Great Physician.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophecy which mentions </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">th® </span><span class="font4">breaking open of the prison-house of death, and the setting at liberty of its captives (Isa. 42:7), was applied, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">unquestionably correctly, by our Lord to Himself; but He did not break </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">open </span><span class="font4">the prison-house of death, and set all the captives free by resurrection </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">imme</span><span class="font4">diately upon His own resurrection. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font4">tells us when this work will be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">done, </span><span class="font4">saying (John 5:25-29), “The </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">hour </span><span class="font4">cometh in which all that are </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font4">graves shall hear the voice of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Son </span><span class="font4">of Man, and come forth;” “and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font4">that hear [obey His voice then, Acts 3:22] shall live.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Lord thus passed over the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font4">terim of the Gospel Age, and pointed to the grand consummation of His work: in the incoming Age because such was the Father’s prearranged Plan. “The&lt; Father sent the Son,” and the Son willingly undertook the work of redemption, at a time sufficiently in advance of the “Times of Restitution,” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ar </span><span class="font4">resurrection, and the general blessing of the world during the Reign of Messiah, to leave the interim of this Gospel Age for another work, namely, for selecting from the world a “littl® flock,” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">“royal priesthood,” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a “pecu</span><span class="font4">liar people,” a “holy nation,” to b® joint-heirs wuth Christ Jesus their Lord in the honors of the Mediatorial Kingdom. These shall be associated with the Redeemer in the grand and glorious work of destroying the Prince of Darkness and breaking open </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">th® </span><span class="font4">prison-house of death, and setting </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font4">liberty the captives of sin and ignorance and superstition; and in fulfilling generally all the provisions of th®“ gracious promises of God made to Father Abraham, that in his Seed (Christ, and His elect Body, the Church), “all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”—Gal. 3:8, 16, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Blessed and Holy Are They </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Whe </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Have Part in the First</span></p>

This includes the living members, whose “change” to spirit nature will be instantaneous, so that the moment of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font4">dying as human beings will be the moment of their “change” to per</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fect </span><span class="font4">spirit beings. Meantime, the Scriptures declare that the Lord’s people who have died, like the rest of mankind, are really dead, as human beings, and know not anything; but Inasmuch as God has provided for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font4">resurrection, and inasmuch as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font4">have been informed respecting it, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">have hopes therein, therefore they </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font4">spoken of as being merely asleep— resting from their labors; waiting for “the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">jne at that day, and not to me only,” as </span><span class="font4">t/he Apostle declares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">General Resurrection to Be a Raising Up By Judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And, likewise the world of mankind, ,®ven though they know not of the Lord </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font4">yet, are spoken of as being “asleep </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font4">Jesus,” because, as the whole world was under condemnation of death through Adam, and that without knowledge or volition on their part, at the time of the sentence, for they were then in the loins of their father, Adam, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font4">now, since Jesus laid down His life </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">Ransom for all,, and because they all shall be awakened from death, therefore it is proper for all those who </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font4">aware of the Divine provision for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">awakening, by faith to speak of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">interim figuratively as a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the Apostle exhorts us to trust and hope in the resurrection • as respects all our dear friends who go </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">down </span><span class="font4">into the prison-house of death, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and not merely </span><span class="font4">as respects those who </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font4">sanctified in Christ Jesus, which would include, as a rule, only a small proportion of those for whom we would </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">inclined to sorrow. He says, “I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep [all our sleeping friends], that ye sorrow not even as others, who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died [a Ransom for all] and rose again [that He might be Lord and Life-giver </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">all] even so [let us believe as truly </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that] </span><span class="font4">those </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">also </span><span class="font4">which sleep in Jesus [all whom He purchases with His precious blood] will God bring by Him [from the prison-house of death].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But as the First Resurrection is the resurrection of the blessed and holy, of the sanctified in Christ Jesus, His Body, so the general resurrection, which is for the world, is designated as “a resurrection of judgment,” mistranslated in our common version “resurrection of damnation.” It is styled a “resurrection of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">judgment” </span><span class="font4">because, while all the preparation has been made, so far as God is concerned, for granting to the world of mankind </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">full resurrection or restitution back </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">all that was first given to Adam, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">lost by his disobedience, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">be recovered by our Savior’s precious blood, yet there are certain conditions attached to this blessing upon which </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font4">depends, namely, the conditions of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">New Covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God does not propose to give eternal life through Christ to any others than those who earnestly desire it, and who are in heart sympathy with the principles of righteousness which must always be the Law of the Divine Government. Hence when the world is awakened from the sleep of death, it will not signify </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">resurrection, </span><span class="font4">but much less; for resurrection, in its full, complete, Scriptural sense, signifies a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">complete raising up, </span><span class="font4">out of sin and out</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• Some are confused by this expression, ‘ffiesli and blood”; they fail to see that it signifies human nature; we therefore invite such to examine the use of the same phrase elsewhere, by the same New Testament writers. Tn so doing' they will be convinced that our definition, human nature, is the cor-r'-'Ct one, the SerHptural one. See the following uses of the phrase: Matt. 16:17; John 3:5, 6; I. Cor. 15:50.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“WHERE ARE THE DEAD?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This sermon was published in Peoples Pulpit, Volume I, Number 3. The interest aroused, and the great demand for copies of this sermon have been remarkable. A sample copy will be mailed to any one free.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">of death, to perfection of being, perfection of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first work of Christ and the Church in the world, for those who have gone down into death, the prison, will be their awakening to physical conditions, similar to those in which they died. The surrounding conditions of society will then be greatly improved; knowledge will have taken the place of ignorance, and the reign of righteousness and the law of love will at that time have superceded the rule of sin under the law of selfishness; and Satan will be bound, that he shall deceive the nations no more for the thousand years. Under the favorable conditions of that Mediatorial Kingdom, all mankind will be required to make progress in the knowledge of the Lord and tn the bringing of their own hearts and lives into accord with His law of Love. Whosoever then will make no effort in the right direction will be cut off from life, in the Second Death, after one hundred years of trial (Isa. 65:20), although he would then, under the changed conditions, be properly reckoned as only a lad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But while judgment will thus pass against one who fails to make progress, and wi-ll cut short his further opportunity, the same judgment, by the same-Judge, will operate favorably to all who will seek righteousness, and make progress in harmony with the laws of the Kingdom; so that year by year they will be growing mentally, physically and morally stronger—approximating gradually the f»ll, complete stamdard of perfect manhood, the image and likeness of the Creator, as first represented in Father Adam. Thus the resurrection, so far as the world is concerned, will be a gradual work; its first step an awakening from the sleep of unconsciousness and nonentity; its succeeding steps will be along the lines of judgment, the conduct of those who are on trial being either approved or disapproved; and culminating either in their sentence to the Second Death, incorrigible, and unworthy of the gift of God, eternal life—or in their perfection, and their final adjudgment of worth! ess to have and enjoy the great boon of Life Eternal, under the blessed conditions which are then promised to prevail—when there shall be no more sighing, no more dying, no more crying, because there will be no more sin and none of the penalties for sin, for all the former things shall have passed away.—Rev. 21:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Condition of the Dead Spoken of As a Sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The condition of all the dead, up to the time when the resurrection work begins, is erne of total uneonsciousness; “There is neither wisdom, nor knowledge, nor device in the grave whither thou goest”; “His sons come to honor and he knoweth it not, to dishonor, and he perceiveth it not of them.” Of each of the Patriarchs of the past it is written, “He slept with his fathers”; “He fell asleep.” And so also in the New Testament we have a similar record: “Stephen fell asleep.” The Apostle Paul speaks of those who saw the Lord after His resurrection and says, “He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to this present time, but some are fallen asleep.” Again he speaks of some which are “fallen asleep in Christ,” here distinguishing between the Church, who are in Christ,* as members of His Body, and the world of mankind in general, who “sleep in Jesus.”—Eccl. 9:10; Job 14:21; I. Kings 2:10; 11:43; Acts 7:60; I Cor. 15:6, 18; I Thess. 4:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Apostle shows ■ that this sleepcondition will prevail, even as. respects the Church, until the time of the second coming of Christ, assuring us that the living members of the Church at the time of the Lord’s Second Advent will not be blessed prior to those that have fallen asleep, but contrariwise, the living “shall not prevent [hinder] them that are </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">asleep,” </span><span class="font4">for the dead in Christ shall arise first; then we who are alive and remain will be blessed, and ultimately experience our “change.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Thou Sowest Not that Body Which</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall Be”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The moment of reawakening will seem to the awakened ones to be the next moment after their death—“for there is neither wisdom, knowledge nor device in the grave.” The bodies in which the world will be awakened will be practically the same as those which died, though not the same atoms of matter; for in the hands of our Creator one atom of dust is as good as another in this great work. Thus the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">* Christ is the title of our Lord as tha New Creature, and of His office; while Jesus is the name of the Redeemer, through whose sacrifice comes to all men an opportunity to share in a resurrection of the dead.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4">Apostle says, “Thou sowest not that body which shall be.” The bodies of the world, as they shall be when awakened, will be really new bodies, in the sense that they will be different atoms of matter; but they will be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">old </span><span class="font4">bodies, in the sense that they will be duplicates of those which died and went to dust. We cannot wonder that the worldly mind, which knows not God and knows not of His power, cavils at the thought of resurrection. It will be a most stupendous work, more wonderful by far than man's original creation; it will thus be to the world of mankind, and to the angels of heaven also, the grandest exhibition ever given of Divine Omnipotence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">His Omnipotence and Wisdom Will Be Exhibited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He who formed man in the beginning, in His Own image, has the power not only to form him again of the dust of the ground, and to re-enkindle the spark of life, but yet more than in these will He exhibit both His Omnipotence and His Infinite Wisdom in the restoration to each being of a brain like his present one, having recorded therein the events and circumstances which have transpired in the present life—just a.w the wax cylinder of a phonograph bears in itself the recorded words of the speaker, which can be reproduced at another time and place. None but an Infinite Being could claim the power thus to reproduce the very thoughts of the billions of mankind. He of whom it is said that He knows the very hairs of our heads and their number, and that not a sparrow can fall to the ground without His notice-only He could do so great and wonderful a thing; and only as we have</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">New Danger in Christian Science</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">f^TVEATH is mortal error!” This is</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; the declaration of so-called Christian Science. All Christian Scientists thus far have made failures; at least, according to their own theory. They had hoped that Mrs. Eddy would never yield to mortal error and hence that she would never die. But she, too, has gone the way of all the earth. How uncomfortable must be the religious theory which fails its votaries at the very last! Every other religious system at least claims progress, growth, from grace to grace; from knowledge to knowledge; from one attainment to another. But Christian Science must admit that thus far all of its votaries have made shipwreck of their faith in the end—have yielded, according to their own theory, to “mortal error”— to the error of thinking that there is such a thing as death and going into it. Alas! how poor and weak is the human mind! How easily deluded!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BehoJd Now a Crave Danger!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have already pointed out that the teaching of Christian Science (that there is no sin and there is no death) is in direct contradiction to God’s Word—“The wages of sin is death,” “The soul that sinneth, it snail die.” We have pointed out, on the contrary, that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Christian Science is in full agreement with Satan’s first falsehood, </span><span class="font4">by which he deceived our first parents, saying, “Ye shall </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font4">surely die.” (Gen. 3:4.) We do not mean to say that Chr-istian Scientists are knowingly in league with Satan and willingly propagating his falsehoods. We have, however, declared and now repeat that we believe that Christian Science delusion is of Satan, with whose word it agrees, and that it is not of God, whose Word it contradicts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Apostle speaks of the “depths of Satan,” and again says that “we are not ignorant of his devices.” We have pointed out the probability that Satan would prosecute his work in the near future through various materializations for the further deception of humanity and their further enslavement to error. But it had not occurred to us that the Adversary might make more use of Mrs. Eddy after death than before it—that her “mortal error” might be made an occasion for the still further delusion and enslavement of well-meaning but deceived people. The latest pronouncement from one of Mrs. E-ddy’s most prominent followers, Augusta E. Stetson, implies much: —</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1) Christian Scientists are now directed to .expect that, as Jesus arose from the dead and appeared to His disciples after His resurrection, so will Mrs. Eddy do. This, to us, means that if possible, the fallen angels will materialize and personate Mrs. Eddy for the further deception of those who have almost worshipped her. Such materializations and deceptions are only what we have expected, although we looked for nothing of this kind from the Christian Science quarter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) That the teachings of Christian Science will hereafter be modeled more carefully along the line which we believe to be the Truth—teaching that the Millennium is nigh, even at the door, with its reign of righteousness </span><span class="font5">and inauguration-’- of a new social or</span><span class="font4">learned to have confidenoe </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in Hina </span><span class="font4">through tne revelation of His Word could we exercise faith in such a stupendous miracle as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font4">has </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">prom' </span><span class="font4">ised. shall be performed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Nor need we expect that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">world </span><span class="font4">of mankind will all be awakened simuk taneously, but rather that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font4">work of the Messianic Kingdom </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font4">begin with those who have not gon&amp; down to the tomb, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font4">who are </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">never= </span><span class="font4">theless in death, in the sense that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">they<sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font4">are not alive in the complete, full! measure of freedom from the power </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">death. When the work of restitution shall have progressed to some extent with these, we may expect that soma of those who have previously fallen asleep in death will be awakened, and share in the blessings of that gloriousf Day. Later, others, and still others^ will arise, until eventually it will bo true that, in that Day, the Day </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Christ, “all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Man”—shall obey the mandate, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Come </span><span class="font4">forth”—and shall be brought to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">knowledge of the goodness and love and mercy of God; and, if they will,, ultimately to the full perfection of human nature—the earth, meanwhile.,, being fitted and prepared as a Paradise of God for His restored family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Meantime, the exhortation to all </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">“called” in the present Age is that we-should seek to make our “calling and election sure” to a place in the Kingdom class, to a change of nature, from human to divine, and thus have &amp;&nbsp;right, under the Divine arrangement,, to have a part in the “first resurrection”—the chief resurrection, the resurrection to the perfection of the Divine* nature with its glory and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">its honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">der. We may be sure, however, tha'i our great Adversary, Satan, will not advocate any measure of the Truth except for the purpose of injuring it </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font4">to take advantage of seeds of Truth, which the Lord has been permitting us to plant through millions of copies of the press. It is a part of his policy, as the Apostle explains, to put light for darkness and darkness </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font4">l<sup>:</sup>ght. At every presentation of tha Truth of the past, Satan has more </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font4">less successfully introduced grievou® errors under its cloak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We give the following extracts from* the New York “World”: —</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Augusta E. Stetson’s Declarations</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I know, and every true believer ir-Christian Science must know, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4">Mrs. Eddy will make a manifestation^ will reveal herself to me and to otlw ers, to the outside world, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">unbe= </span><span class="font4">lievers, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The same situation exists to-day </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">aE </span><span class="font4">when Jesus of Nazareth died and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font4">buried. After three days He mank fested Himself, to prove that there 1® life after d»th. Mrs. Eddy will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font4">the same, for she occupies in the world! of to-day precisely the same po-sittois that Jesus occupied in His day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It may take, will take, longer </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font4">Mrs. Eddy to pass through the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">expe</span><span class="font4">rience of material death </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">stage </span><span class="font4">of demonstration of everlasting </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">life, </span><span class="font4">It may not occur for years, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font4">it </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">may </span><span class="font4">occur to-morrow or next week. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font4">she will manifest herself, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and ail me® </span><span class="font4">shall know of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Those in the church who profess doubt of such a demonstration are like the disciples who doubted till they saw and felt of Jesus. I shall see </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Mrs, </span><span class="font4">Eddy again, and I shall walk by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">her </span><span class="font4">side, holding her hand, along the path that leads to life which has no death, All men who will believe will be shown how they may, by spiritual means,, demonstrate over death, but first they’ must await Mrs. Eddy’s manifestation,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Yesterday I -would not answer-questions relating to the expected demonstration by Mrs. Eddy—her resurrection, as some call it I felt </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">then </span><span class="font4">that the hour for me to speak had </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font4">come. To-day </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">am convinced </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">time is proper. From all quarters I am receiving reports of demoralization and sadness in the field ®f Christian Science because of the delay in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">th® </span><span class="font4">demonstration and because of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">spreading abroad </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">o€</span><span class="font4"> declarations </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4">Mrs. Eddy will not manifest herself</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“To say that Mrs. Eddy is gone </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for-</span><span class="font4">ever is to deny the very principles </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Christian Science and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">refute </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">teachings of her life and her works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The age of the gospel is closed/<sup>9 </sup>went on Mrs. Stetson, speaking in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">th® </span><span class="font4">most earnest way. “A new era </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font4">opening, the era of the one thousand years which the Bible tells us will follow the second appearance of Christy the opening of the Millennium. Christ means Truth, and Mary Baker Eddy was Truth on earth again. I am waiting and watching, and my students* are waiting and watching, for we know the moment is at hand when God will prove, in the person of Mrs. Eddy, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4">she was His inspired mouthpiece, to teach and unfold the glories of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Truth </span><span class="font4">and Love and Life which are </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">represented </span><span class="font4">by Christian Science,”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">/\UR TEXT assures us that the V called ones of this Gospel Age are many in comparison with the few who will eventually be chosen as the “very •elect”—who are elected or chosen to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">the joint-heirs with Christ in the .Messianic Kingdom, which is to bless </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ihe </span><span class="font4">world of mankind in general— the non-elect. We now consider the •call or invitation which has been made •during this Gospel Age—the class </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">whom it has been extended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It should be carefully noted that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">Scriptures do not say that all </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font4">•called. On the contrary they tell us that many are blind and deaf to God’s message now being circulated—the Gospel. Such cannot be said to be called in any proper sense of the word. A •call is an invitation which, is heard. As we look out over the world in general we see the vast majority in heathen darkness, as the Apostle </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span><span class="font4">presses it, “having no hope and without God in the world.” (Eph. 2:12.) They have never heard of “the only Name given under heaven and amongst men whereby men must be saved.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">had no opportunity of responding to that call. With the thought that has prevailed for centuries, that these uncalled millions are doomed to eternal torture, the hearts of God’s people have been very sorely troubled, and infidelity has been very greatly assisted into a denial of everything pertaining to Christian faith. All agree that it would be very unreasonable for the Creator of those 1,200,000,000 to expose them to the danger of eternal torment, and not give them the slightest opportunity for hearing of the only terms of salvation from it. But when we get the correct, the Scriptural view of the matter, we see that the penalty upon those 1,200,-000,000 is, “Dying thou shalt die,” and that in this particular they are not different from their fathers, who were under the same curse, or sentence ■of death—the Adamic condemnation. We see from the Scriptures, too, that our Lord Jesus “by the grace of God tasted death for every man”—“to be testified in due time.” (Heb. 2:9; 1 Tim. 2:6.) Jesus, therefore, tasted death for all these 1,200,000,000 and for all their forefathers. He has given the ransom price for their sins as well as for ours, the Church’s, and a resultant blessing must come to them as well as to us. The coming blessing is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a, </span><span class="font4">rescue from the sin-and-death conditions in which they were born; an opportunity for rising out of those conditions of degradation, up, up, up, to full perfection of nature, and all that was lost through Adam’s disobedience. This work of Divine Grace we see is to be accomplished for the world during the Messianic Age, when Christ and the Elect Church will constitute God’s Kingdom, with power and great glory for the blessing of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Advantage of the Hearing Ear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We who have heard the Lord’s voice calling us, inviting us during this Age to joint-heirship in the Kingdom, have an advantage over the heathen, as knowledge is always an advantage. No injustice is done the heathen in leaving them without this knowledge, but a favor is conferred upon those who have the hearing ear. Our salvation, like the world’s, waits for the New Age. In the morning of that glorious thousand-year-day the Church is to be rescued first, as it is written, “God will help her early in the morning.” (Fsa. 46:5.) These He will use here as His instrumentalities in blessing the heathen and all the families of the earth, as says the Apostle John, “The Spirit and the Bride shall say come, and whosoever will may come and take of the water of life freely.” (Rev. 22:17.) The Bride must be developed before she can join with the Spirit in inviting the world to the blessing which God has in reservation, and this Gospel Age is for the very purpose of calling and testing, proving and selecting the Bride class; and at the Mose of this Age the marriage of the Lamb will come, and the faithful Church will thenceforth be the Bride in glory, and in association with the Bridegroom in His Kingdom work. Thus our second blessing is the privilege of accepting God’s gracious arrangement and becoming his “very elect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Christendom’s 400,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having disposed of the 1,200,000,000 of heathendom, and finding that they have no call, but are under gross darkness, blindness, we now turn our attention to the estimated 400,000.000 called Christendom, and ask to what extent have these seen, heard and understood respecting the grace of God in Christ. Many of them have heard church bells ring, many of them have been inside edifices consecrated to the worship of God, but a comparatively small number have ever really heard, in the sense of truly understanding or knowing the meaning of the Gospel message. These few who have some understanding of the message are generally confused by it, and by reason of this confusion and misunderstanding of the call they are split into an hundred parties and sects. Some lay most stress upon election, others upon free grace, others upon immersion, others upon various forms of church government, etc. Out of the whole number only a comparatively small proportion have any clear conception of the Truth—of how we became sinners, of what the penalty against the race is, of how Christ paid the penalty, of how His death was the satisfaction for our sins, of how God could be just and justify those who believe in Jesus, or how the call began at Pentecost and continued down during the Age, of the purpose and object of the call, what the called are called to and what are the terms and conditions of the call, and what will be the result to the majority after, from amongst the called ones, a few shall have been chosen to be' the Bride of Christ, the “very elect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Light for the Righteous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is certainly a fair statement of the world’s ignorance, and it is corroborated by the Apostle, who tells us in so many words that “The God of this world hath blinded the minds of those who believe not,” and he again intimates that even believers see only in part. (2 Cor. 4:4; 1 Cor. 13:12.) Again he assures us that we who are believers should desire increasing light, and be assured that God intended the light for the Church only—“Light is sown for the righteous, truth for the upright in heart”; and again, “Thy Word is a lamp to my feet, a lantern to my footsteps”; and again, “The path of the just is as a shining light, which shineth more and more until the perfect day.” (Psa. 97:11; 119:105; Prov. 4:18.) The Apostle prays for the Church along the same lines, intimating a measure of blindness continuing with us for some time after we have accepted Christ and have become His followers. His words are, “For this cause I ’ bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jeusus Christ—that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the length and breadth and height and depth; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowlege.”—Eph. 3:14, 17, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Many, Yet Few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do we not see, then, that the called ones mentioned by our Lord as “many called” are merely many in proportion to the few who will constitute the elect? and that the number of called is not many as respects the whole number of our race, but, on the contrary, few? So then, our Lord’s words, interpreted by other Scriptures, signify that a few of the world are called during this Gospel Age, whereas none of the world were called prior to this Gospel Age, during the 4,000 years from Adam to Jesus. (Eph. 2:12.) Only the Jewish nation was then dealt with by the Lord at all, and they were not called under the terms of this Gospel Age. As we see the selection which the Lord is making, we should appreciate the more the value of our knowledge of Him, and whatever we have heard of His Call, that by using the same we may greatly profit ourselves and secure the “pearl of great price,” joint-heirship with our Lord in His Kingdom. We should make our calling and election sure by diligent faithfulness to the terms and conditions regulating this selection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Is Poverty a Blessing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why did not our Lord say, “Come ye righteous, come ye educated, come ye wise, come ye rich?” Why did He on the contrary say, “Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden”? Why did he so frequently intimate that Fis chosen ones would be composed chiefly of the poor of this world, rich in faith? Why did he say through His Apostles, “Not many rich, not many great, not many learned, not many noble, not many wise hath God chosen, but chiefly the poor of this world”? (1 Cor. 1:26, 27; Jas. 2:5.) The answer is not far to seek: The rich, the noble, the learned, the self-satisfied righteous are not in the condition of heart to hunger and thirst after the things which God has to give now. And God is so presenting His Truth now that it will appeal only to those of a certain character, a certain kind of disposition. As for the righteous He informs us that there are none such, that all have sinnecB and come short, all have violated the Divine Law, and all are under the sentence of that Law, even though some have sinned much more egregiously than others.—Rom. 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As for education and wisdom, these do not enter into the Lord’s call, because, as the Apostle declares, much of it is foolishness in God’s sight, because much of it is error; and when God gets ready to give knowlege and wisdom to His “very elect” he &quot;can give them the pure article. (1. Cor. 13:10).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Why the Poor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But why should he seek the poor? Has he need of poverty? We answer, No! and He is not seeking all of the poor; but the poor in purse,, poor in influence, poor in education and poor in character, with all their disadvantages, have the great advantage that their condition is favorable to humility—it is easier for them to accept the Lord’s terms and conditions and to give their all than it is for others who have more to give up and who feel less their complete dependence. So, then, without despising greatness, nobility, riches, honors, but while rightly appreciating and valuing these, let us learn to appreciate the advantages we have if we are humble, poor and lowly. And those who are rich in any of these particulars must learn the same lesson, that in order to be of the Lord’s followers they must become poor—that faithfulness to Him will cost them their influence in the world; faithfulness to Him will lead them to lay at His feet all of their wealth, financial, intellectual and moral—all to be used in joyful service of the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Come, Ye Laboring and Heavy Laden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the real pith of our '.Lord’s words lies in the terms, “Ye that labor and are heavy laden.” This may have a measure of application to farm labor, counting house labor, factory labor, etc., but its special significance is to a labor of heart, heavy laden with its appreciation of sin and degradation. Some of us. in our ignorance of the true standards of righteousness, may at one time have had very self-satisfied sentiments before coming to the Lord and entering into a covenant with Him and accepting His favor and the covering of His Robe. We perhaps have been thoughtless respecting what should be the true standard before the human heart, what should be the true standard of responsibility to God and to our fellow men; but as the eyes of our understanding become opened to the facts, as we struggle with ourselves for mastery over inherited weaknesses and frailties, as we obtain high ideals and seek to measure up to them, we find ourselves weary and heavy laden in the attempt. Happy is the man who has reached this condition of realizing his own meanness by nature, and of getting a glimpse of the grandeur of Divine perfection, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">standard, the ideal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And 1 Will Give You Rest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who have come to Jesus in response to His invitation find in Him, in His Fellowship, in His Word, in His peace, which comes from believing His promises, a blessing far beyond anything they could at first understand.— (1 Cor. 2:9, 10.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They find that they have assistances in the assurance of their Master that the present rest of faith will by and by be succeeded by the actual rest of the Kingdom; that what they have by faith now in anticipation, they are to more than realize by and by when in the resurrection they shall be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, and be like their Redeemer— see Him as He is and share His glory. To the extent that they can exercise this faith in the Lord and in His promises present and future, in that same proportion they have cause for rejoicing, and experience the rest, the peace, the blessing, which the Master assures us will be theirs when He said. “I will give you rest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“According to Thy Faith;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But some one will say, We cannot exercise this faith; we must bold on to the things of this present life; we cannot sacrifice social position, or wealth, or honor of men, or time, or influence—we cannot sacrifice these on a bare hope of a better resurrection and an everlasting glory in the Kingdom. We must walk by sight not by faith. Why should God make a test of faith? Ah, we answer, that is the very point: The Lord is making, an election according to faith, as we read, “According to your faith be it unto you.” Not every person is able to exercise this faith, and those who cannot do so are not to be eternally tortured because of their inability. Nevertheless their failure to exercise faith demonstrates that they cannot belong to the class whicn the Lord is now electing or selecting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Their blessing will come in the Messianic Age, where knowledge and sight will give place to faith and trust. Blessed therefore are the poor in spirit; it is easier for them to exercise faith— easier, therefore, for them to come into alignment with the Divine conditions. Let all of us who have been laboring and heavy laden with an appreciation of our own weaknesses and imperfections, and who have heard the Master’s voice assuring us that He has paid the penalty and that He appropriates to us of His merit to give us a standing before the Father, count all things but loss and dross that we may win Christ—a place in the anointed, glorified Church; that we may be heirs of God, joint-heirs with Jesus Christ our Lord in the incorruptible inheritance which, under the great Abrahamic Covenant, the Oath-Bound Covenant, is to bless the world.</span></p>

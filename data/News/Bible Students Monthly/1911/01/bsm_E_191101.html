<p><span class="font6">T</span><span class="font3">HE desirableness of oneness in the Church of Christ is beyond dispute. The impropriety of sectarianism </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font3">division is now generally conceded, although twenty years ago many defended the divided condition of the Church as being helpful. They pointed </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">our Lord’s words, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">am the Vine </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and ye </span><span class="font3">are the branches; every branch in me that beareth not fruit my Father, the Husbandman, taketh away. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And every </span><span class="font3">branch that beareth </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">fruit he </span><span class="font3">pruneth, that it may bring forth more fruit.—John 15:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They claimed that the denominations were the branches. The evident teaching of the Master here is that his people are related to him in an individual sense and not as parties, sects or denominations, and that they are dealt with from the individual standpoint as one Church and not many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">St. Paul enunciated the same great truth </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 </span><span class="font3">Cor. 12:13), declaring that the Lord Jesus is the Head of the Church, which is his Body, and that as the human body has many members under the full control of the head, except when diseased, so the Church, as members in particular of the Body </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Christ, are all to be subject to the Lord as their Head. They are all to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font3">so connected with their Head, and thus with each other, that when one suffers, all suffer with it, and when</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Church Federation Quite Different</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It must be conceded that Church Federation or Confederacy is in many respects quite a different thing from the Church’s oneness illustrated by our Lord’s parable of the vine, and the Apostle’s illustration of the human body. Nevertheless, since a Federation is proposed as the nearest possible approach to the enjoined spiritual Union, it is proper that we and all Christians everywhere should enquire carefully the cost and the gain implied in the Federation movement. In this series of discussions the cost of Federation to the creeds of the most prominent denominations will be impartially considered. First in the list let us consider the sacrifices of Congregationalism, Presbyterianism and Methodism.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(1) As to Church Government very slight .concessions will be required of any of the federating denominations. Denominational liberties as respects forms of worship and methods of government and discipline are to be permitted very loose rein. The Federation proposes chiefly the regulation of home and foreign mission work and a general watch-care over the interests of the federated systems along the lines of political influence. The expectation is that the political power of the Federation will have considerable to do with moulding of legislation favorable to the Federation, and later on, unfavorable to the smaller denominations not associated in the Federation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) It is along doctrinal lines that the sacrificing in the interest of Federation will be chiefly demanded.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">that he predestinated an elect, saintly few to heavenly glory, and equally foreordained that the remainder of thousands of millions of non-elect should be maintained in life to all eternity, in order that they might suffer excruciating pains, both mental and physical, never-ending, as a part of the supposed penalty of the “Original Sin” committed by </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font3">first </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">pa</span><span class="font3">rents in Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Evidently there will be few people in these highly intelligent Christian bodies ready to insist, as our forefathers did, that this element of faith is essential to salvation. Few of us would agree with Brother John Calvin, the great architect of this creed, that feti'ow-Christians rejecting this doctrine should be burned at the stake, as Brother Calvin decided in respect to Brother Servetus. No, thank God! We have outgrown some of the narrowness which so terribly fettered some of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font3">brethren during the dark ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">No Infants in Eternal Torment</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Few any longer believe that there are “infants in hell not a span long,” because non-elect. Even where the doctrine of Election is still blindly held, few have the temerity to state their belief that any innocent infant was predestinated to everlasting torture. But Brother Calvin’s contention, expressed in the Westminster Confession, is that there are no </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">innocent </span><span class="font3">infants—that the condemnation </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Original Sin was to eternal torture and that Adam’s children, “born in sin and shapen in iniquity,” were therefore not innocent, but guilty—born under the sentence of eternal torment and salvable from it only through membership in the Church of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Indeed we may say that this theory was still older than 'Calvin, for did not St. Augustine first declare the danger of infants to eternal torture and the necessity of their being brought into the Church of Christ by baptism in order to escape eternal torture? And is not the force of this teaching still manifest amongst both Protestants and Catholics, as evidenced by their fear to have an infant die unbaptized ■■—so that some, in extreme cases, even practice “baptism in utero”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Doctrinally Methodism is indirectly opposed to Calvinism in every sense of the word. Possibly Methodists will have less to concede than Calvinists, because, although in Wesley’s day the doctrine of Free Grace was combatted on every hand, it is now the tacit faith of the vast majority of Christendom. The doctrine that God had premeditated and irrevocably foreordained the eternal torture of our race except a handful of the Elect was too horrible a one to stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So the Methodist doctrine of Divine Love for all and Free Grace as respects salvation has appealed more and more to the growing intelligence of mankind. Nevertheless we cannot do otherwise than concede that it will matter little to the thousands of millions which all “orthodox” creeds consign to eternal torture whether they shall suffer eternal agonies as a result of Divine lovelessness in foreordaining their sufferings or of Divine inability to outwork for their benefit the supposed advantages of Free Grace arranged for them by Divine Love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The More Excellent Way</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our suggestion is that now, in the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ator as an all-powerful, but merciless </span><span class="font3">sovereign.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">In this blessed light now shining from God’s Book have we not a basis for Christian </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">union? </span><span class="font3">Let us see! If we can find in God’s Word that the doctrine of Election and the doctrine of Free Grace are both true, both Biblical, but that one belongs to the Church in this Gospel Age and the other to mankind in general in the coming Age, will not this solve our problem and give us doctrinal </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">union </span><span class="font3">instead of a mere federation based Upon the ignoring of doctrine? We can all assent to this, therefore let us Examine the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible assuredly declares a Divine election according to a Divine purpose foreordained—but not such an election as Brother Calvin outlined. God foreordained the selection of a Church, predestinating the number who would constitute its membership and the character of each one who would be acceptable as a member. He foreordained tests as to the worthiness of these members and the glorious reward that should be theirs and a great work which they shall be privileged to do for mankind—limitedly now, fully during the Kingdom reign. Accustomed to the election of fellow-citizens to the Presidency, to Congress, etc., where they will have the opportunity for blessing the non-elect, we should have carried this same thought to the Divine election of the Church. We Should have discerned that the elect Church, the “Seed of Abraham” (Gal. 3:29), is specially intended to be the channel of Divine blessing to “all the families of the earth” (Gen. 28:14).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How strange that we overlooked this and the assurance that with the completion of the Church Messiah would exalt her in the “First Resurrection” to be his Bride and joint-heir in his Mediatorial Kingdom, to be established</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">for the blessing of all mankind! How strange that we did not notice that every text of Scripture used by our Methodist brethren to substantiate their doctrine of Free Grace belong^ to the New Age! As, for instance, the Bible, after telling us of the completion of the Church, now espoused </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">the Lord, and after her marriage </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font3">union with him at his Second Coming, as “the Bride, the Lamb’s Wife,” tells that then “the Spirit and the Bride</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">of the future—the blessing of the world of mankind with a mental, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">moral, so</span><span class="font3">cial and physical uplift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Proper View of Election</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Cannot we all, Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Methodists, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font3">others of God’s people, unite. as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">one body </span><span class="font3">upon this Scriptural hypothesis? Are we not satisfied with the terms of this election—that they are sufficiently stringent to exclude all except the saintly? Hearken to the Apostle’s declaration, which we once so grievously misunderstood: He says of God’s election, “Whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son.” In other words, when our Heavenly Father foreknew and predetermined to gather an elect Church as the Bride of Christ, he also, predetermined that none could be members of it unless they attained through faith and obedience in the School of Christ characterlikeness to Jesus—heart likeness </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">him—hence, as nearly as possible, an obedience of the flesh to his Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Surely no one will claim that any but a little flock has ever attained to this honored condition; hence our former ideas respecting the non-elect would consign the majority of our families, neighbors, friends and all the heathen to endless woe. But now how differently we see in God’s Word that the elect class is selected in advance, that in God’s due time, with the Redeemer, it may bless every creature with fullest opportunity to return to human perfection in a Paradise </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font3">gained—restored during the Times </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Restitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This proposition of th</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">e</span><span class="font3"> Scriptures Includes those who have gone down to the prison-house of death—into </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sheol, </span><span class="font3">into Hades, both the evil and the good. All shall then know, from the least </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">the greatest, that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font3">every man.” They shall know that the</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">redeeming blood was not shed in vain, but will secure to each member of Adam’s race, not eternal life, but </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font3">opportunity to attain eternal life—-either on the heavenly plane during this Age or on the earthly plane </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">during </span><span class="font3">the Messianic Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have we not, in this beautiful </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">election </span><span class="font3">of the Bible, the basis for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">grandest of all hopes, the highest </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In the light now shining we may see that the terms of the Divine election of the Church are in every sense of the word without partiality, except as regards character and faithfulness. Those now called with the heavenly calling to be of “the elect” are indeed invited to eternal life on the spirit plane, to be like unto the angels, but more exalted, while the opportunities to be granted to the world in general during the Mediatorial reign will be inferior, earthly, restitutionary—yet grand.—Acts 3:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But this difference of reward is counterbalanced by the severer trials</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">CHANGES OF CREEDS NECESSARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For Baptists, Adventists and Disciples </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In Order to Federation</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Say yg »ai, A Federation, to all them to whom this people shall say, a Federation ; neither</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.”—Isaiah</span><span class="font3"> 8:12.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">■\TUMERICALLY </span><span class="font3">Baptists, Adven-tists and Disciples represent more than one-third of the Protestants of the United States. What they must yield for Church Federation is therefore an important question. All three of these systems are built upon the Congregational platform, which recognizes as Scriptural the independence of each congregation as to its own creed in all matters of faith and Church order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These bodies of Christians, therefore, could not join the Federation as denominations. The only method by which they could give adherence would be either by abandoning their principles of independence for which, they have so long contended, or else by remaining quiescent while their ministers through Councils and Conferences essay to act for them. And here it should be noted that the membership of these large Christian bodies have more and more during the past thirty-five years shown their willingness to have their ministers regulate their affairs, even though contrary to their avowed principles of Church Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But it is from the standpoint of doctrines rather than Church government that we shall examine our subject. As we progress we shall find that some of the doctrines once considered all-important can in the light of our day be laid aside as obsolete—as hindrances in every sense of the word. Caution, however, would suggest that for everything discarded as unscriptural the truthful substitute should be found— otherwise our progress would be toward the destruction, not only of the bad of our creeds of the past, but also of their good features.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Doctrinal Surrender of Baptists</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Baptists will find little to dispute with their co-religionists of the Federation along general doctrinal lines; their chief difficulty will be in the matter of what constitutes Christian baptism—the necessity of water immersion to admission to Church membership. For years this doctrine has been even more tenaciously held than is generally realized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our Baptist brethren hold to justification by faith as a first or preliminary step which the sinner must take. But they equally hold that this is not the final step—that the step of sacrifice, the step o'f regeneration must follow in order to salvation. And a baptism in water they recognize as an indispensable outward indication of this regeneration. Hence it is standard Baptist doctrine, both North and South in all Baptist Churches with rare exceptions, that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">no unimmersed </span><span class="font3">person should </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be esteemed a member of </span><span class="font3">Christ’s Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a word, faith and reformation are steps of justification, but water immersion is the door into Christ. Only those who pass through this door are members of the Church of Christ from this viewpoint; hence, consistently, none others are invited to partake of the Eucharist—the Lord’s Supper. The argument is that this Supper, symbolizing death with Christ, was offered only to the consecrated and accepted members of Christ’s Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What Baptists No Longer Believe</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Like the rest of us, our Baptist friends have been in the past rather illogical in all matters religious and doctrinal; so much so that many of them have never realized the full meaning of their doctrine. The meaning was grasped in the long ago,, but has generally been lost sight of within the last fifty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">। It is this: Since water immersion is the evidence of obedience to Divine instruction and since all of “the elect” are not only instructed of God but obedient to him, therefore those not baptized in water are not of God’s elect—are not members in his Church. And this in turn, according to Baptist doctrine, implies that all not immersed in water are outside of the Church— outside of the number of “the elect”— outside of God’s favor—outside of the salvation provided in Christ—and therefore inside the damnation and eternal torment which Baptist doctrines imply have been foreordained for the eternal torture of all the nonelect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do our Baptist friends who meet unimmersed Christians of 'Other denominations in the walks of life from day to day really believe that the latter are on their way to an eternity of torture? Most assuredly they do not! But this is merely because they are illogical, like the rest of us. They are as illogical asi their brethren of other denominations. They have outgrown at least this feature of the teachings of the “dark ages” handed down to them by well-meaning but less enlightened forefathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One glance at the matter will suffice to show our Baptist brethren that the very strongest features of their teach-., ing need some revision. However fundamental may be the doctrine of baptism, some of their conclusions respecting it will be greatly advantaged by a liberal pruning. But caution should be used. The Bible should be consulted. We offer the suggestion that too hasty a rejection of water immersion would be a mistake—that the proper course for our Baptist friends is to study the Scriptures afresh on this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What wonderful advantages are now at the command of all Bible students! They have marginal references by which one passage throws light upon another. They have also concordances, glossaries, indexes, and all manner of helps for Bible study. Our forefathers before the Reformation were generally illiterate. And even had they possessed education the pen-written Bibles were expensive and obtainable only in the Latin language. Indeed it is within only the last few years that Bibles have become cheap and plentiful and the masses able to read them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What Must Adventists Concede?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The doctrine of the Second Advent of Christ is common to all denominations. And the Adventist belief that at that time the earth will be burned up is also a feature of all the various creeds. Many adventists have abandoned the thought that the Savior’s second appearing is at hand. And many more are abandoning the thought that when he appears Adventists alone will be saved and all the remainder of mankind will participate in the destruction and burning which shall then engulf the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It should not be difficult for them to realize that there is no great necessity for controversy along the lines of the time of Christ’s coming, since they acknowledge themselves completely in the dark on that subject. Neither can we suppose that after thoughtful consideration they should feel justified in assuming that they alone are “the elect.” Let us hope that with broadening sentiment they are more and more realizing that there are saints and sinners in their own number, as well as in all denominations and as well as in the world; and that “the Lord knoweth them that are his” and will care for them regardless of denominational lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But for that portion of Adventists which considers the keeping of the Seventh Day of the week the all-important part of Christianity, we see no ground for Federation, unless, indeed, they may choose to get about the difficulty by counting the calendar the other way around the world. Thus they might bring their Seventh Day into harmony with what others term the First Day. Or, by counting the calendar in the opposite direction they may still keep their Seventh Day and realize that others are keeping the same day, though calling it the First Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Disciple Doctrines to Be Voided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Undoubtedly Alexander Campbell was a good man with a great head. And undoubtedly many of a similar class following his lead are today known as Disciples or Christians. Undoubtedly these are following closely to apostolic customs in the matter of Church organization, which in many respects is beautiful in its simplicity. Doctrinally they claim most faithfully to stand by the Word of God alone. And one of their familiar declarations is, “When the Word of God speaketh we speak; when the Word of God is silent we are silent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But this beautiful simplicity of theory our Disciple friends have found difficult to work out in practice. Hence we find them as strongly intrenched behind unwritten creeds as are others behind elaborated creeds. These are inculcated through the writings of their standard authorities—including the editors of their leading journals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Discinles” hold most tenaciously as the Bible teaching that baptism in water is indispensable to the remission of sins. This doctrine is supported by several Bible texts which declare, “Arise and be baptized and. wash away thy sins”; “Baptism unto repentance and remission of sins,” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before pointing out their misapplications of these texts let us note the facts that according to their theory </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font3">others of mankind, Christians, Jews </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">heathen, who have not been immersed have not had their sins washed away. Consequently such are yet in their sins. Consequently such are lost. And lost, according to the general understanding of Disciples and other Christians, signifies shut out of heaven —shut out of Paradise—shut into hell and its eternal torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do our Disciple friends act as though they believe this teaching? Do they spend all of their time and energy and money in seeking to bring fellow-Christians into water baptism for the remission of sins and escape from eternal torture? Assuredly they do not. Hence we are justified in supposing that like our Baptist friends they have not taken seriously and logically their own doctrines. Rather they have assented to them thoughtlessly. It would appear to us, therefore, that doctrinally our Disciple friends might easily be prevailed upon to abandon their peculiar tenet to the extent that it would not hinder them from losing their identity as advocates of “baptism for the remission of sins” and merging themselves or federating with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To assist them out of their difficulty we remind them that all the Scripture they cite in support of immersion for the remission of sins belonged to the Jews, and none of it to Gentiles. The Jews were exhorted by John the Baptist and others to renounce sin, to return to harmony with Moses’ Law, and to show this change of character by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But those Ephesians who believed in Christ and whom Apollos baptized for the remission of sins did not receive the holy Spirit. St. Paul explained to them that their baptism was an improper one—that they as Gentiles required ah immersion into Christ (Acts xix, 1-7; Romans vi, 3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Baptist Union Not Federation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font3">a former article we suggested to Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Methodists a union of heart and head as better than federation, so now we suggest to the denominations whose doctrines we are here considering. What we shall suggest respecting baptism will apply to all Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All Christians agree that Jesus and his Apostles taught baptism, and thus it is written: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism” </span><span class="font3">(Eph. 4:5). We cannot here elaborate, but merely suggest that nowhere in the Scriptures is infant baptism commanded or urged. The expression, “Believe and be baptized,&quot; implies a mental development capable of belief beyond that which infants possess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The original pretext for introducing infant baptism was set forth by St. Augustine, who urged that as all mankind were going to eternal torture except the Church, it was necessary to get infants into the Church; and baptism was set forth as the door-way. All parents, of course, were anxious that their children should be immersed into the Church and saved from eternal torture. And those good wishes were certainly commendable, even if unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Subsequently immersion was declared to be unnecessary and sprinkling became its substitute with all. The thought of preservation from eternal torment thereafter attached to the sprinkling. Although our minds have broadened, so that comparatively few believe St. Augustine’s presentation, nevertheless the custom of infant sprinkling continues with more or less of fear to abandon it for the child’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who will dispute that St. Paul’s words of Romans 6:3-5 are the clearest presentation of the import of baptism furnished us in the Bible! The passage is cited in proof of every theory of baptism, yet it supports only ene—the true one. Notice that it does not say, as many suppose, So many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">into water. </span><span class="font3">It </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">does </span><span class="font3">say, “So many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">death.” Is </span><span class="font3">there </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font3">a difference? That difference is the explanation of all of our difficulty on this subject. The clearing of it away furnishes the foundation for harmony between all; and not merely for harmony, but for union amongst all classes of consecrated Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Consider the passage critically. First, immersion into Christ signifies to the justified believer his immersion into, his burial into, the Body of Christ as a member of “the Church which ’is his Body” (Eph. 1:22, 23). The Apostle sets forth clearly a distinction between the Church and the world and between the salvation of the Church and the salvation of the world. The Church are “the elect” of the Lord, called and chosen; and if faithful, they will be members of the glorious Church beyond the vail. She, as the Bride of Christ, will be his</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■companion and Queen during the Mediatorial reign of glory for the blessing of the world—for the blessing of the non-elect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Baptism Into Christ’s Death</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">St. Paul not only tells us of our need to be thus immersed into membership in the Body of Christ, but he proceeds to tell us </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">how </span><span class="font3">that membership can be brought about. The words, “Baptism into his death” explain the matter. How strange that we ever thought these words signified water immersion! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our </span><span class="font3">eyes are now opened! Plainly, now, we see that “into his death” signifies our participation with our Lord Jesus in suffering for righteousness, in self-denials, self-sacrificings of the same character as those, endured by the Master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is true indeed that the whole world suffers pain, sorrow, disappointment, etc.; yet our Lord suffered differently from all others, and our dying must correspond to his. He suffered, the Just for the unjust. The holy, harmless, undefiled One laid down his life sacrificially, voluntarily, joyfully. And we, to share in his death, to be “baptized into his death,” must do the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">True, Jesus was spotless, while we .are members of the fallen race. But we are justified through faith in his blood. And hence we have in the Divine sight through him a standing of human perfection or justification. ’This standing is granted to us or imputed to us for the very purpose of permitting us to sacrifice our human rights and earthly interests as he sacrificed his. The “elect” are to be dead with him, that in the resurrection they may live with him and be like him and «hare his glory, honor and immortality. By consecration we present our bodies living sacrifices holy and acceptable to God, as the Apostle declares (Rom. 12:1). Thus we are “immersed into Ais death” and thus we become </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">members </span><span class="font3">of his Body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whoever fails to be thus immersed into Christ’s death will fail of the membership in his Body—will fail to be of his elect Church, his Bride. The difference between being dead with Adam and being dead with Christ is very great. By nature we are all dead with Adam. He was a sinner, condemned. We as his offspring are the same. It was necessary therefore that we should by faith be lifted out of this condition of death with Adam, in order that by consecration of all earthly interests we might become dead with Christ. Thus we share with him his sacrificial death and, by participation in “his resurrection,” will also become sharers of his Kingdom glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus’ Baptism Ended on the Cross</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ridding ourselves, then, of the un-scriptural theory of an eternal torment awaiting the non-elect, may not all Christians perceive the reasonableness ■of the Divine proposition to bless the world through the elect? As Jesus by his sacrifice was made Head of the Church, so all who will be his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">members </span><span class="font3">must share his spirit of self-sacrifice—• death to the world and earthly interests. Only such may share with him in his Messianic Kingdom work of blessing, uplifting, instructing, assisting all of the non-elect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many of the non-elect under the fuller light and better opportunities ■of the Mediatorial reign will turn from sin to righteousness, from death to life eternal. This “baptism into death” with its blessed reward excludes none ■of any denomination. It includes in the Church of the elect those of every denomination and of no denomination who comply with its conditions of faith and obedience and consecration unto death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Was not this our Lord’s baptism as he described it? Just before his crucifixion he said, “I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am straitened (troubled) until it be accomplished!” His baptism dated from his consecration at Jordan, but it was not fully </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“accomplished” </span><span class="font3">until on the cross he cried, “It is finished”—his baptism into death was finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Was not this baptism into death what he referred to when speaking to his disciples? James and John requested that they might sit on his right hand and left hand in the Kingdom. In reply Jesus said, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Are ye able to.be baptized with the baptism that I ‘am baptized with?” </span><span class="font3">Surely he did not </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font3">fer to a water immersion! Surely he did refer to his baptism into death, and meant his Apostles to understand that only by </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">sharing in his baptism into death </span><span class="font3">could they hope to sit with him in his Throne (Mark 10:37).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With this reasonable, logical, Scriptural view of baptism before our minds which of us would be inclined to dispute over the form of the symbol or in respect to the class of persons who should properly use the symbol? Surely none would claim that infants could thus believe and thus consecrate to death! Surely all would agree that a symbolical immersion into water such as was practised by the early Church, according to all the records, would be the most reasonable, most beautiful, most appropriate method of symbolizing the real baptism into Christ—-into his death.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">EPISCOPALIANS, CATHOLICS, LUTHERANS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What These Creeds Surrender</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To Enter the Church Federation Proposed</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Say ye not, A Federation, to all them to whom this people shall say, a Federation; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.'<sup>1</sup>—Isaiah</span><span class="font2"> 8:12.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">O</span><span class="font3">F the three oldest denominations of Christendom—Episcopalians, Catholics and Lutherans—the latter have least to surrender. Their tenacity for the Word of God they may still maintain, • even though others of the federated bodies might more and more abandon the Holy Scriptures, under leadership of the Universities, Colleges and Seminaries teaching Higher-Criticism-Infidelity and the Evolution theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Federation nevertheless would still permit Lutherans and others to love and reverance the Word of God and yet be in fellowship. Almighty God, the Son of God and the holy Spirit, firmly believed in by Lutherans, would all be acknowledged, with more or less of mental reservation by all the denominations associated in the Federation. Nothing along these lines would need to be abandoned. Even Luther’s plea of consubstantiation in the Eucharist may be held without objection. Even the honor of being the first denomination of the Reformation might still be held. We conclude, then, that Lutherans would not be required to sacrifice anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Things in Common</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Episcopalians and Catholics have some things in common. They each claim to represent the original apostolic Church. They each claim (through their bishops in the laying on of hands) apostolic authority. Their common claim is that all other denominations of Christians whatsoever, are false churches without Divine authority and hence not to be recognized or tolerated. Accordingly no minister of another denomination would be permitted to preach either in a Catholic or an Episcopalian pulpit. And if by mischance such a circumstance should occur it would be considered necessary to purge the sacred spot by a kind of re-consecration. From the standpoint of these denominations all others are heretics; but, they say, not willingly so, but ignorantly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here note the fact that a cleavage is in process amongst Episcopalians. A minority, termed high-churchmen, are gradually separating Romeward, while the majority are sharing the sentiments of other Protestants, to the effect that the matter of “apostolic succession” is probably less important than their forefathers supposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font3">the purposes of this discussion we may without offense ignore the high-church minority and say that the Scriptures which plainly foretell the perfecting of Church Federation indicate that it will include Episcopalians, but will not include Catholics. Nevertheless the intimation is that while the Federation will be a Protestant </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">one, it will not be anti-Catholic. On </span><span class="font3">the contrary, the two great systems, Catholic and Protestant, will fraternize and co-operate along various lines —especially in the manipulation of social and political influences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Episcopals Sacrifice a , Little Pride</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The breadth of the Episcopal creed will not call for particular sacrifices in Federation, if only their pride on the subject of apostolic succession can be satisfied. They are all prepared to admit that no particular wisdom or holiness has been communicated from generation to generation, from bishop to bishop and from bishop to lower clergy through the laying on of hands. They are willing to admit that there have been men as wise and others as foolish outside as inside their Communion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They are willing to admit that no greater light upon the Word of God and its meaning has come down to humanity through its channels than through outside channels. They are willing to admit that their clergy have no more of Divine Grace and Truth, Wisdom and Power than have others of God’s people, both clergy and laity, outside their boundaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hence they are willing, nay, &quot;&quot;xious, for Federation, and ask only that their “face be saved,” by some acknowledgment of the long idolized thought that ability to expound the Scriptures and the Grace of God in expounding them could be had only through their channel. They have no desire to prove</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">Let us, therefore, not be content merely to federate! Let us </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">unite </span><span class="font3">our hearts and heads and hands as members of the Body of Christ; let us be baptized with his baptism, into his death!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">their claim to superior grace and truth by measuring swords of the Spirit with other ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Up to the present time Episcopalians decline to be parties to the Federation unless their special claim be in some sense or degree recognized. Pride says it would never do to retract now all that the denomination has stood for in separation for centuries. They would urge Christians of the other denominations, especially the clergy, to consider the advantage which would accrue to the Federation by having all Protestant ministers accept their ordination. They do not claim that it would make them wiser or better men, nor more efficient teachers, either of truth or error. But they do claim that it would give them an </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">authority in the eyes of the people </span><span class="font3">and give color </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">reasonableness to the Federation of many churches with discordant creeds posing as one church in the Federation arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Common People Thinking More</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The argument is, “The common people, the laity,” are disposed more than ever to think for themselves on religious subjects and to study the Bible for themselves. If, therefore, as ministers, you desire to hold the people in check so that they shall not think for themselves you would do well to concede the claim of apostolic succession —that no one is permitted to interpret or teach the Bible except those who have received apostolic benediction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was disregard of this claim of apostolic benediction which led to freedom of thought on religious subjects and ultimately led to the formation of the various sects. You should now seek to restrict further investigation of -ths Bible and further interpretation of it by accepting our theory, by permitting us to grant you recognition in some simple form of the rights of apostolic authority through our bishops. If you do not do so you will more and more lose your hold on the people, for we are coming more and more to a time of individual thought on every topic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures intimate that this argument will ultimately prevail and great Protestant denominations be thus vitalized and, in co-operation with Catholicism, for a short while dominate Christendom socially and politically, crushing out individual thought and negativing and black-listing all religious teachers outside the Federation and its Catholic Ally. From this standpoint the Episcopal system will lose nothing, but even be a gainer of prestige through the Federation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What Catholics Would Surrender</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For Catholics to join the Federation would signify the surrender of a great deal, and yet, in the light of the Twentieth Century, surely much could be surrendered without any sacrifice of manhood—merely with the sacrifice of a little pride. For the Church at Rome to federate with the Protestant Churches would mean that they ceased to protest and that she relinquished her peculiar claims:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(1) That she alone is the Church of Christ and has authority to instruct.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) That she is more than a Church </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font3">prospective Kingdom—that to her has been committed by God the rulership of the world in respect to all matters temporal and spiritual, hence that she is the reigning Kingdom of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) That her Pope is the authorized representative of Christ, anointed and commissioned of God to fulfil all the prophecies of the Scriptures rejecting the reign of Christ, his Mediatorial Kingdom, etc. This claim of Papacy that the Pope’s reign is de facto the reign of Christ is expressed in the declaration that he is the Vice-gerent of Christ—the one reigning instead of Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(4) The doctrine of trans-substan-tiation—that by the blessing of a priest the ordinary bread and wine are transmuted into the actual soul of Christ—■ (his flesh and his blood) for sacrifice afresh in each celebration of the Mass.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Whatever may have, been true in the remote past, assuredly our Catholic friends can no longer claim that all the purity, all the faithfulness to God, all the sanctity of life amongst be</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">lievers in Christ are to be found in her communion. St. Paul declares, “If any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his.” Surely all Christians admit this standard and the correctness of the Apostle’s teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hence the ignoring and setting aside of all creeds and barriers which have heretofore hindered the Unity of the Church of Christ might be possible. Thus the first Catholic objection might easily be removed in favor of Federation, or, still better, in favor of Union. As our Episcopalian friends fail to prove that the apostolic succession to ordination gave either greater wisdom or more grace to their clergy than to other ministers of the Gospel, might not our Catholic friends reasonably admit the same?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A Claim Now Easy to Lay Aside</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second claim that Papacy is God’.s Kingdom, that the Popes reign successively as Christ’s Vice-gerent, should not be difficult for Catholics of our day to lay aside. However strongly it was held in the dark past it is surely little appreciated by Catholics to-day. No longer do the Popes dominate the civil rulers of Christendom. And ho longer do the people consider it wise that they should do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">More and more the masses appreciate the fact that the original kingdom of earth was given to father Adam and that mankind as his children are the natural heirs of the inheritance. More and more the people are disposed to consider popes, czars, emperors and kings as merely figure-heads, without any real title or authority from heaven to rule or to coerce the people. More and more the masses demand Congresses, Parliaments, Reichstags and Doumas. And more and more do they demand that these shall reflect the sentiments of the people in civil and religious matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The day of darkness and ignorance in which the people believed that popes and kings were Divinely appointed to •rule them with Divine authority has gone by. General intelligence has taught mankind that it is a mistake to suppose that one God-appointed king and kingdom were Divinely appointed to wipe another Divinely appointed king and kingdom off the face of the earth. Hence popes and kings now admit that they reign by a popu-lar sufferance, and their appeals for money, for armies and navies, is no longer on the score that they were Divinely instructed to obliterate each other, but on the score of self-defense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Divine Appointment Not Believed</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This claim, however, wholly destroys the argument that we are now or ever in. the past have been under Christ’s Kingdom, either direct or through the popes. Neither now nor at any other time in the world’s history has there been a reign of righteousness such as the Scriptures declare Christ’s Kingdom shall inaugurate. May we not, then, with good grace—Catholics and Protestants—admit that neither our Catholic popes, emperors and kings, nor our Protestant kings, emperors and heads of Churches are reigning with any Divine authority manifest to human judgment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let us humbly admit the nonsense of the legends on our coins, Catholic and Protestant, to the effect that kings and popes reign by the grace of God—• by Divine appointment. Let us rather say that they came into power through the exercise of brute force and in a time of common public ignorance. Nor by this do we mean any disrespect to the governments of to-day—rather we have shown that to-day the people are ruling through their Congresses, Parliaments, Reichstags, etc., and that the kings and emperors are mere figureheads of power, more or less useful and dependent upon the good-will of their people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If it be asked how we shall account for the period of the dark ages and autocratic and devilish misrule, our reply would be to point to the Apostle’s words. He declares that Satan is the god or ruler of this world,’ who now operates through the disobedient— through those not in harmony with God, who constitute the vast majority in Christendom and elsewhere. And we remind , you that our Lord Jesus also spoke of Satan as being the Princv of this world or age (John 12:31), an/’ of himself as the Prince or Ruler of the coming Age, the Millennial A so (John 18:36).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ah, yes! the sooner both Catholics and Protestants admit what they and all the world now see, the better— namely, that for a long time our great Adversary held us in a bondage of ignorance and superstition, in getting free from which many bright minds have reacted towards infidelity, because they did not see that many of the teachings of the past, both Catholic and Protestant, were not only irrational, but most positively unscrip-tural teachings of men, and, as St. Paul declared, “doctrines of demons” (1 Timothy 4:1).</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Not Vice-gerent Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In view of the foregoing—in view of the fact that the Divine titles of all kings and emperors are now abrogated, papacy need feel no special disgrace to her cause in similarly abrogating the claim that the popes reign as representatives of Christ or have authority so to do. Indeed, such </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">claim is more safely denied than held, for in the light of our day papacy's best friends cannot look into the past and point with pride to any achievements as properly representing the reign of the Prince of Peace—Immanuel. In the light of the present all of God’s people, Catholics and Protestants of every shade, should rejoice to join in the Lord’s Prayer—“Thy Kingdom </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">come; </span><span class="font3">thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.” Surely this is what all saints of all denominations should desire and pray for and labor for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not that we can hope to bring it to pass of ourselves, however. Nearly nineteen centuries of efforts show to the contrary. Even our last century </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">great missionary endeavor, Catholic and Protestant, proves this. United States statistics show that in the year 1800 there were six hundred millions of heathens, and that in the year 1900 their numbers had doubled—there were twelve hundred millions of heathens. While continuing our exertions on behalf of the heathens abroad and at home, let us tie our faith to the Apostle’s words and “wait for God’s Son from heaven” (1 Thess. 1:10).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the second coming of Christ and the glorification of his Church, “his elect,” “his saints,” gathered from all denominations, Catholic and Protestant (and some from outside of all of them)—only then will the glorious reign of Christ and the Church begin. Only then will the spiritual Seed of Abraham be complete and the work of blessing the unregenerate world begin —the Messianic Kingdom work—the</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Church Triumphant</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Church in glory and in power will contain no hypocrites and no merely nominal Christians—only the true, the saintly, the “sanctified in Christ Jesus.” Nevertheless it will be composed of two classes, as illustrated by the Priests and the Levites in the type. (1) Jesus glorified, the antitypical High Priest, and his faithful footstep followers, the antitypical under-priesthood, otherwise his “Bride.” Together these are styled a Royal Priesthood, or a Kingdom of Priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">St. Paul tells us that Melchizedek, who was a priest upon his throne,, merely typified the Church Triumphant —Head and Body—The Christ, “A priest forever after the order of Melchizedek”—a priest upon his throne. During the New Dispensation that glorious Priest, Head and Members, will bless and uplift, rule and judge, the world of mankind, with a view to recovering as many as possible, as many as will obey him, from the ruin of sin and death.

Thus eventually in the close of the new dispensation God’s will shall be “done on earth even as it is done in heaven”—as fully, as completely.

<p><span class="font3">Summing up, then, we find that Lutherans would have nothing to lose by Federation—nothing to surrender, except a little pride. Episcopalians likewise will find Federation to cost them little. They can well afford to join the Federation, especially on terms upon which they insist—the recognition of ‘the apostolic succession. And this they can afford to concede in its very mildest form, realizing that it has never specially advantaged them anyway and is impossible of demonstration, in view of the fact that the Scriptures declare that there are but twelve apostles of the Lamb and symbolically show only a twelve-star crown to the Church during this Age and only twelve foundations to the New Jerusalem—the Church in glory. How then could bishops either possess or give apostolic blessings? (Rev. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">12:1; 21:14.)</span></p>

The nominal Church includes those whose manner or whose attendance on worship implies a relationship to Christ without having gone the length of a full faithacceptance of him in sacrifice, perhaps without having fully turned from sin even in their hearts, and without having made a full consecration to serve the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This nominal mass may be subdivided into believers who are favorably disposed toward Christ and righteousness; others who regard the Church as merely a moral club designed for social and moral benefit or influence upon the world, by counteracting sinful influences; still others, bitter at heart, sinful and selfish, having no faith whatever in Jesus and no</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">that the Christ, Head and Body, may be merciful and faithful towards the people of the earth. Likewise it is proper that the world should know that its judges have thus been tempted and tried, and are able to sympathize with them in their weaknesses and in their endeavors for righteousness—and more willing to help them up, up, up to human perfection than to consign them to the Second Death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Union or Federation—Which?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We ask, What advantage will accrue to the Church Militant through the oncoming Federation? We reply that great advantage will come to the saintly few, not in the manner expected,, but along the lines of the Divine promise that “All things shall work together for good to them that love God —to the called according to his purpose.” The Church Federation, which, the Scriptures distinctly show us will be effected, will include the various’ classes already indicated:—(1) Hypocrites; (2) Moralists; (3) Indifferents; (4) Followers afar off; (5) Saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But in the Federation the Moralists and Higher Critics will be dominant forces. The saintly will'less than ever be in evidence and appreciated. The outward and apparent success of the-</span></p>

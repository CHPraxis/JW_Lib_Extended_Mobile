<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Religious and Scientific Gleanings</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MR. ROCKEFELLER'S FORMER</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PASTOR AN EVOLUTIONIST</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. Dr. Abed Claims Bible is Founded on a Myth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rev. Dr. Aked, until recently of the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church, is quoted in the “New York Press” as follows:— “The flood is not believed to be a fact in history by a student of the Scriptures or by a student of science. The story of the flood and many others tn the Bible are too much at variance with themselves to warrant belief in them as history. It may be startling to be told that the Bible is founded on a myth, but—.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We admire frankness. We believe that all ministers who disbelieve the Bible should be frank enough to say </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bo.</span><span class="font5"> Then it would rest with their congregations to decide whether or not th6y desired their services at fat salaries. The truth is that the majority of the ministers, less Courageous then Dr. Aked, less conscientious, less honest, fear to lose their job and hence falsify in a negative manner, by allowing the people to suppose that they still hold to the vows which they took at the time of their ordination to the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We disagree with Dr. Aked when he says that Bible students do not believe the -stories of the flood, etc; The people Who disbelieve the Bible do very little Studying, as we might expect. The people who are Bib’.' students, especially if they get the proper light upon it, find their faith in it continually increasing. We would like to recommend to Dr. Aked and others who doubt the stories of the Bible respecting creation and the flood that they read a book entitled “The New Creation,” published by the Bible Students Association, Brooklyn, N. Y. Well did the Lord through the Prophets of old testify of our day, “The wisdom of their wise men .&quot;hall perish. The understanding of their prudent men shall not be manifest.” (Isaiah 29:14.) Would that those who are losing their , faith in the Bible could get a glimpse of its real beauties and harmonies from the standpoint of “The Divine Plan of the Ages, or Bible Keys.” What a revelation it would make—what a recurrence to the testimony of the Word of God respecting the fall, the redemption and restitution!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who deny the fall of our first parents, wh.o claim that primitive man was cousin to the ape, should not claim to be Christians at all. Why? Because the Redeemer declares that He “came to seek and to save that which was lost,” while these wise men tell us that nothing was lost and that everything is being gained and was being gained before Jesus came into the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another reason why they should not claim to be Christians is that they disbelieve the only record which tells about Jesus and reveals Him as a Savior. Jesus believed the story of the fall, the story of the flood, the story of Jonah and the great fish, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, etc. He quoted these as true. If He was t not as wise as Dr. Aked to know the truth from untruth, then evidently He ■was not as suitable a person to be the Savior of the world as Dr. Aked would be, and all should be worshiping and reverencing and following Dr. Aked and the Higher Critics and Evolutionists, instead of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is nothing short of foolishness to say that Jesus was the Son of God, the world’s Redeemer and Messiah, and yet to say that He was deceived by the tnyths of primitive man and less wise than Dr. Aked, et. al., in respect to what constitutes truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, if it be claimed that ,Jesus was wise and that the Bible misrepresents Him and that He never endorsed the story of Adam and Eve and the flood, Jonah and the great fish, etc., then the Bible record is a falsification and unworthy of any belief or acceptance. In that event, where will Dr. Aked find another, better, fuller record concerning’ Christ and what Dr. Aked’s “wisdom of this world” decides on the subject?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sooner we give up the folly of claiming to be Christians while denying the foundation of Christianity, the better it will be for ourselves and everybody else. It is such insincerity that is nauseating the world and making professed ministers of Christ and their preaching a byword.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IMBECILITY AND EPILEPSY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MARK TOPERS’ CHILDREN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the sins of alcoholic parents are visited upon the children unro the third generation was shown by Dr. Alfred Gordon, of Philadelphia, who presented a mass of careful statistics showing that many cases of insanity, ■epilepsy, imbecility and immorality exist chiefly in those whose parents and /grandparents were topers. He spoke at the fortieth annual meeting of the American Society for the Study of Alcohol and Narcotics, in convention in Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His study embraces 298 cases of mental deficiency observed in 117 families, taking into consideration only the living members, the mortality of children at an early age being very great. He declared that alcoholism is unquestionably one of the direct causes of imbecility, idiocy and feeblemindedness in the offspring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The pictures traced from facts, gathered with a great deal of accuracy, show that alcoholized individuals create degenerates... and the , mental’y feeble,” said Doctor Gordon. “They, in their turn, continue the chain endlessly, if not interrupted. One such family is capable of throwing into the community dozens of useless or dangerous individuals.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Creates Mental Degenerates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. D. H. Kress, superintendent of a sanatorium in Washington, discussed “The Relation of Narcotics to Race Suicide and Longevity</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After pointing out the small birth rate in France, England and Germany, Doctor Kress said that no country is more endangered by race suicide than the United States. Turning to Baltimore, he said there were 8375 births 'there in 1875, and yet in 1910, when the population had increased about 100 per cent., the number of births was only 8796.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He urged before an increase in the birth rate an improvement in the quality of the children born. “Sterility and high living,” he said, “are the chief causes of the trouble. Drunkenness, where women nurse their own children, is rare.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Criticises Use of Coffee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The use of caffeine in various forms, notably coffee, was greatly deplored, and the speaker declared such an inebriate more hopeless than one addicted to alcohol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Prevention of Inebriety” was treated by Dr. G. Milton Linthicum in an interesting paper. In concluding his remarks he said:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Legislation must follow education, and not education legislation. The keyword of the prevention of inebriety must be education — education of the child, education of the youth, education of the fathers and mothers, of the medical students, the young physicians, teachers, professors and lawmakers as to the true, scientific facts of alcoholism and inebriety, and then only can we hope to prevent inebriety.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font5">UR TEXT IS A PART of the Divine prophecy of the blessings which will come to Israel and to the whole world during Messiah’s glorious reign of a thousand years—beginning with the close of this Gospel Era. Succeeding verses tell that in that glorious Epoch landlordism will be a thing of the past. “They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them; they shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat.” Additionally we read, “They shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble.” Further we read that then “The wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat fodder like the bullock.”’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">No Spiritual Sheep, Oxen, Wolves, Etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No end of confusion has been created by the attempt of well-meaning people to apply these prophecies as the reward of the Church in heaven. Nothing in the Scriptures warrants us in thinking that there will be spiritual, heavenly sheep and oxen, wolves and lions, vines and houses, planting and building. Those who reject the clear, Bible teaching respecting a Messianic reign of righteousness cannot understand the Bible at all Not a single passage of the Old Testament tells of heavenly hopes or promises. Only a few of them teach heavenly things at all, and then indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As, for instance, in the types of the Old Testament the garments of the High Priest, glorious and beautiful, symbolize, we believe, the heavenly grandeur, honors and glories of Messiah during the period of His reign. Similarly, God’s promise to Abraham declares that his Seed, his posterity, shall be as the stars of heaven and as the sands of the seashore. Nothing in this statement would necessarily teach a heavenly state or condition. Only by the aid of the New Testament and the Holy Scriptures’ illumination can we see that two Seeds of Abraham are distinctly referred to, the stars indirectly implying the Spiritual Seed, while the sands of the seashore refer to Abraham’s Natural Seed. As it is written, “I have constituted thee a father of many nations”—like unto God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So the Spiritual Seed of Abraham la now being developed. With its completion this Age will end, and the Natural Seed of Abraham will return to special favor and become the leading nation of the world, under the guidance and direction of the spiritual and invisible, yet All-Powerful, Kingdom of Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The blessing through natural Israel will gradually extend to every nation, in that the door will be opened by which all nations may come into and become a part of Abraham’s Seed, and thus into harmony with Messiah’s Kingdom. Whosoever refuses this great privilege, and blessing of Messiah’s Kingdom will be destroyed from among the people* in the Second Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Hundred Year Old Children</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Centenarians of the present time are few, and they by no means are like children. Usually they are wrinkled and haggard. We are to remember, however, the Bible record that several of the earlier members of Adam’s race lived’ nine hundred years, or rather, they were more than nine hundred years in coming fully under the sentence against sinners. “By one man’s disobedience , sin entered into the world, and death as a result of sin; and thus death passed upon all men, because all are sinners (Romans 5:12).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Gradually, and especially since the flood, when a great change took place in our cosmogony, human longevity has decreased, while mental, moral and physical ailments have increased. Several of Adam’s children did not have their first born child until after they were a century old. In confirmation of this, and correspondingly in contradiction of the Evolution theory, We find that the Ancients were stronger than we, mentally as well as physical</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">SINNER, ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD, YET ONLY </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">A CHILD, E</span><span class="font8">LECTROCUTED</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thenceforth there shall be no more [death of] an infant of days, nor of an old man who hath not filled his days, for the dying one shall be but the child at an hundred years old—a sinner at a hundred years old, he shall be accursed”—cut off from life.—Isa.</span><span class="font5"> 65: 20.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">ly; for they intermarried brothers with sisters and cousins without injury, whereas today the mental weakness of the race is such that one out of every one hundred and fifty adults is in an insane asylum, and the marriage of brothers and sisters is prohibited, and even the marriage of second cousins is disapproved and held responsible for increasing weak-mindedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We see, then, that our text, describing Messiah’s Kingdom, merely explains that Restitution blessings will recover mankind from the effects of the fall, so that it shall then be as it was in Adam’s day—that full human maturity will be reached in a century, and that a man dying then would be dying in childhood, so to speak, as compared with the remainder of the race. The further guarantee is that none will die even at a hundred years of age, except wilful sinners who, refusing to submit themselves to the regulations of Messiah’s Kingdom, will then be cut off from life as unworthy of any further favor at the hands of the great Redeemer — Messiah—all of whose dealings will represent Divine Justice, Wisdom, Love and Power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Man’s Years as a Tree’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures tell us that under Messiah’s Kingdom the days of a man -Shall be as the days of a tree. And it is believed that some trees live to be at least a thousand years old. This is God’s provision for every man—every member of the human family—after He shall have accomplished the wdrk of the Gospel Age, the selection of the Spiritual Seed of Abraham, typified by the priests and Levites, “Tba Church of the First-born, whose names are written in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Messiah’s Kingdom is to. dominate the earth for a thousand years, with a view of blessing Adam and all of his posterity — with a view of uplifting them from sin and degradation and death. The uplifting influences will begin at once, following the great time of trouble with which the Kingdom will be inaugurated. The judgments of the Lord will be abroad in the earth and the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. None shall longer need say to his neighbor or his brother, “Know thou the Lord; for all shall know Him, from the least unto the greatest of them,” for “the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the whole earth” (Jer. 31: 34; Isaiah 11: 9).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whoever, then, by obedience to the laws of the Kingdom will avail himself of the blessed privileges of Restitution (Acts 3: 19-21), will not only be helped upward out of mental, moral and physical Imperfection, step by step toward perfection, but, so long as he progresses, he may live—clear down to the end of that blessed thousand years. If we had never seen trees; if our own experiences had been with vegetation such as perishes within a year, we might have difficulty in believing some one who would tell us of having seen trees centuries old. Such a statement would seem as unreasonable to us as to tell us that humanity could live on earth for a thousand years, or forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Have we not indeed seen children old and wrinkled looking, yet only in their teens? And have we not seen others cheerful, fresh and comparatively young-looking at sixty and seventy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">All Unrighteousness is Sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the present time (xod “winks” at much of the wrong-doing that there is in the world. He does not interfere with it. But of course every transgression carries with it naturally more or less of a depraving influence on the transgressor’s mind and body<sub>o </sub>The conscience is the most tender and the most important element of our human nature. Whoever violates it, whoever injures it, much or little,, will proportionately be disadvantaged in the future and will have all th® more difficulty in rising up gradually</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">not contemplate the solidarity of one universal ecclesiasticism. </span><span class="font5">We ought , all to understand the difference be-I tween union and unity. Union is the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">V </span><span class="font5">joining together, and may exist organ-' ically and outwardly where there is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font5">essential oneness of life and purpose; that is to say, union may be mechanical, like a tree that has been made by nailing branches to a trunk, with twigs tied on with wire. Such a tree lacks essential oneness and can</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font5">never bear fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But unity means essential oneness, as when a tree grows its own twigs. The unity for which Christ prayed is a unity of aim, of life, of spirit. He</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">prayed that the various parts of His church, even to the individual members of it, might stand so related to each other that they would co-operate with one mind and one spirit in saving men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Evidently the Apostles so understood His doctrine; for they did not undertake to bind into one ecclesiasticism ’ |he various churches which they </span><span class="font6">planted in varidtiS regions </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">6f</span><span class="font6"> the’ </span><span class="font5">world. These churches were largely self-governing, subject to no instituted, general, governing body, subject only to the authority of the Apostles and their own constituted local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And yet when the occasion arose, as occasion did arise over the question ©f the circumcision of the Gentiles, every church was ready to hear the decision of a council ready to pass on such a question. They were organ-, Ically Separate, as to their ordinary ongoing, and yet they were essentially united; there was no union, but there was unity. This is what Christ contemplated, and we are bold to say it was all He contemplated. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having put this in the clear, we now have a question to ask: What is the attitude of Christ toward an ec-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">clesiastical arrangement which is at war with this purpose of His to preserve unity in His church? Does such an ecclesiastical arrangement align itself obediently under this great prayer of His? Or does it violate the whole purpose and meaning of His prayer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have a further question: Is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ecclesiastical situation of American Methodism such as to promote unity, or have we an arrangement that in hundreds of places scandalizes the name of unity? If any one thinks to cut the ground from under the present trend of American Methodism by showing that Christ did not pray for organic union, let that somebody tell us whether we have what Christ did pray for, and tell us whether the present situation is at war with what He prayed for and whether this trend is really in the direction of fulfilling the prayer of the Master. —• Western Methodist.</span></p>

When it comes from the furnace the wool is dyed and made into lengths like cloth.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Church’s Trial Shorter.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5">' The Church, whose trial is in pro-‘ gress during this Gospel Age, receives ' individually a much shorter period of probation than our text declares will be granted to mankind in the future. God’s saintly people are expected to develop character and to approve themselves to God as “overcomers” within a very brief space of life. And not only so, but they are required to “walk by faith and not by sight.” They merely have God’s Word as re-■ scects His Justice and Love and gracious plans, while, in the next Age, the world will have the actuality instead of the promise—the world will walk by sight. “The glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together” (Isaiah 40: 5).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The world during Messiah’s reign will be privileged to walk on a Highway of Holiness, from which all the stumbling stones will have been gathered out. But the overcomers of the Church class are required to walk in the narrow way, steep, difficult, rugged, and beset with snares of the Adversary. “For we are not ignorant of his devices” (2 Corinthians 2: 11).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are not to forget, however, that these differences between . the Church and the world are fully offset by the differences of reward. The overcomers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">of the Church are to be rewarded with glory, honor, immortality, “the divine nature,” and be joint-heirs in the Kingdom, as members of the great Messiah.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Respecting the first volume of this work “The Atlanta Constitution” says editorially:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is impossible to read this book without loving the writer and pondering his wonderful solution of the great mysteries that have troubled us all our lives. There is hardly a family to be found that has not lost some loved one who died outside the church—outside the plan of salvation, and, if Calvinism be true, outside of all hope and inside of eternal torment and despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This wonderful book makes no assertions that are not well sustained by the Scriptures. It is built up stone by stone, and upon every stone is the text, and it becomes a pyramid of God’s love and mercy and wisdom. There is nothing in the Bible that the author denies or doubts, but there are many texts that he throws a flood of light upon that seems to uncover their meaning.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">at death. Not so with humanity in general. </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ab</span><span class="font5"> we have just seen, some may live for only a hundred years and then be cut off in the Second Death, because found unworthy of further opportunity. Others, by availing themselves of the privileges and rendering obedience to the laws of the Kingdom, may live to the very close of the thousand years, and be found unworthy of eternal life. Still others may so fully appreciate Divine Wisdom, Justice, Love and Power and may become so obedient thereto that God will be pleased to grant them eternal life. Their days, their lives, will be far more than the days of a tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The world of mankind, at the conclusion of Messiah’s reign of righteousness, will have attained again the perfection originally enjoyed by father Adam. Like him they will be in Eden, which then will be world-wide. Those perfect human beings will be required to stand a test—to demonstrate, to prove their absolute loyalty to God and His righteous laws, as Adam was tried, tested, proven in Eden. As Adam was promised eternal life if his test proved him loyal to his Maker, so his restored race will have before them the offer of eternal life if they shall manifest their obedience satisfactorily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan Loosed From Prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are not informed of the particulars of the test that will then be applied to mankind. We merely have the figurative declaration that Satan, sin and everything which Satan represents will be loosed for a little season at the close of Messiah’s reign (Revelation 20: 7-10). The world, full of perfected humanity, “as the sand of the seashore,” will all be subjected to the test. But how many, or what proportion of the whole, will prove loyal, and what proportion disloyail, we are not informed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All that we know on the subject, and all that is necessary for us to know, is that the trial will be thorough and just and that all found faithful will have eternal life, and all found unfaithful will be counted as followers of Satan and, with him, will be destroyed in the Second Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The test which God will apply will be so searching, so thorough, that although His creatures will still be free moral agents, He is able to guarantee that thenceforth there shall be no more sighing, no more crying, no more dying, because all the former things of sin and death shall have passed away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Salvation of the Church AND THE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Salv</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">ation o</span><span class="font11">f the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“So Great S&lt; Nation, which began to be spoken by our Lord, and was confirmed unto us t&gt;y those who heard Him.”—</span><span class="font5">Heb. 2:3.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font5">N THE PAST many of us misunderstood these words—</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“so great </span><span class="font5">salvation”—and have thought them to apply merely to an “elect” few of the saintly followers of our great Redeemer. Surely it should not be thought strange if a closer examination of God’s Word would demonstrate to us that as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are His ways and plans higher than ours (Isa. 55:9). It should not surprise us to find that our forefathers were generally in considerable darkness ,in respect to “the length and breadth and height and depth of the love of God, which passeth all understanding” (Eph. 3:18, 19).' It should not surprise us to find that our Savior will yet see the fruitage of the travail of His soul and be satisfied (Isa. 53:11), and that this satisfaction will result from the salvation of more than the “little flock,” who walk in His steps and who, like Him, “present their bodies living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to God,” in the service of Truth and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are several ways of treating this thought, that more than an “elect” few are eventually to reach eternal life through the Redeemer of mankind. One way, which many adopt, is to claim that our Lord and the Apostles did not really mean to establish so high a standard of saintship as their words imply, and then to conclude that the unsaintly will gain eternal life as well as the saintly—all except the degenerately wicked. This view of matters, which is the common one, is undoubtedly prompted by sympathy for friends, relatives, neighbors and the heathen; but it is wholly contrary to God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another view still held by some is that everybody but the saintly will suffer torture eternally and hopelessly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The third theory which we desire to present here is the one we believe to be in. accord with every text of Scripture, and in accord with Justice, Wisdom, Love and Power Divine, and in accord with sanctified common sense. We have time for only an outline of this Plan, which is most comprehensive, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Reward* Life—The Punishment^ Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not a word is said about the hundred-year old sinner<sup>1</sup>—child-*—being sent: to eternal torment, just as there is not. a word said in the Bible to the effect that Adam or his children were con» demned to eternal torments. The sen* tence upon Adam, which his race, shares by heredity, was a death sentence. This just but awful penalty has wrought havoc with our race — sickness, sorrow, pain, dying, death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s mercy has provided the redemption of Adam and his race* through His Son, who* died, the Just for the unjust. The death of Jesus* is the price which will eventually secure the release of Adam and all of' his posterity from the death sentence* and give to them resurrection privileges provided through Messiah’s Kingdom reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But every one who has been enlightened, and brought to a clear knowledge of God and to the opportunities* provided for his salvation from sin* and death, is more responsible for the* manner in which he accepts or refuses* “the gift of God, eternal life through* Jesus Christ our Lord.” As the wilful, intelligent sinner in the Church now is sentenced to the Second Death* (Hebrews 6: 6; 10: 28-31), so, our text tells us, it will be with the masses* of mankind during the Messianic reign. If they wilfully reject reconciliation* to God, they will die the Second Death, God has provided a redemption an&amp; recovery from the first death, but assures us that the Second Death witf-be an eternal one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Electrocution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Instant death from electric shock* will be the method of executing the* penalty of wilful sinners during the next Age, and not hanging nor decapitation. Thus it was that in olden times* two of Aaron’s sons, having violated their relationship with God and having disobeyed Him, were smitten to death. Fire from the Lord smote them —an electric flash. We may be sure that torture will not be needlessly inflicted on such. They will lose everything, but will not be tortured. Stripes* or punishments, chastisements, are-sometimes used of the Lord, but always in a reformatory manner — “He chasteneth every son whom He re-ceiveth.” He chastens none others — none for whom chastising would accomplish no blessing. Such will be smitten down in the Second Death,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Saintly New Creation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Salvation in no sense began before the Redeemer’s birth, forty-one hundred and twenty-eight years after the* fall of our first parents. In all that long period nobody was saved. The-Apostle declares in our text that salvation began to be preached by Jesus. Again we read that Jesus brought life and immortality to light through His Gospel (2 Tim. 1:10). So, then, life and immortality and the Gospel Message began to be preached by our Lord and were not preached before His day. Indeed we can see that if there is “none other Name given under heaven or amongst men whereby we must be saved,” than the Name of Jesus, then it could not have been preached; nothing could be preached previously except the Divine declaration that God purposed in due time to redeem mankind from sin and death through a Savior and a Great One—One able to save unto the uttermost all that would come unto the Father through Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This reasoning is surely true to the facts. Search all through the Old Testament and there is found no promise of eternal life set forth except by the Law given to the one little nation of Israel. That Law declared that he that doeth these things shall live by his obedience thereto (Rom. 10:5), and the Apostle assures us that Jews died because none of them kept the Law— because no imperfect human being could possibly meet the requirements of God’s perfect Law. “By the deeds of the Law shall no flesh be justified in His sight” (Rom. 3:20).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Apostle, further explaining the matter, says, “Wherefore, then, serveth the Law?” He replies to his question, “It was added because of transgression until the promised Seed: should come.”—Gal. 3:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Promised Seed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Apostle’s words direct </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">,ou» </span><span class="font5">thoughts back to Eden, when </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God de</span><span class="font5">clared that the Seed of the woman would at some future time bruise </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Serpent’s head. But that Seed did not exist for “over four thousand </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">years </span><span class="font5">after, and has not yet crushed the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ser</span><span class="font5">pent’s head—destroyed sin and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tbt works of Satan.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">The Apostle’s words again remind us of God’s promise to Abraham, “In thy Seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed” (Gen. 28:14). Abraham was not thus blessed, nor were any others thus blessed, however faithful they were. All the blessing was to come through Abraham’s Seed and could not be dispensed before His coming. Hence the Apostle, referring to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the faithful of past time, declared, “AH these died in faith, not having received the promise” (Heb. 11:13)—the blessing—reconciliation to God and eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And when Jesus came He did not attempt to bless the world, but on the contrary, in His prayer, declared, “I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given Me” (John 17:9) •—the saintly, the “very elect” (Matt. 24: 24). These He called, these He taught— “Israelites indeed.” These He directed to give the same message to others, not for the conversion of the world, but for the calling, instruction and edification of “the Church, which is the Body of Christ.” The message to these from first to last was that they were called to suffer with Him, that they might also reign with Him.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">life everlasting or death everlasting. And only the faithful footstep followers will gain the glory, honor, immortality and joint-heirship with Him in His Kingdom. These are the “elect,” the “very elect.” These are such as make their calling and election sure by so running as to obtain this great prize of membership in the Body of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These elect ones experience a change of nature, and in the future will not be human beings, but partakers of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). They will be inducted into the perfection of the divine nature in the First Resurrection, the chief resurrection, in which they will be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, because flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.—1 Cor. 15:50-52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Human Salvation Is Restitution</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We all gagged at the thought that the heathen and everybody except saints would be consigned to an eternity of torture, yet we all recognized that heaven is not a place of development but a condition of perfection. We were perplexed, mystified. We did not follow our Bibles with sufficient care. Many of us twisted the Scriptures, wrested, them from their plainly obvious</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">all opportunity to thus sacrifice the human nature and become joint-heirs with Christ and partakers of the heavenly nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then will be introduced a new period styled, in the Scriptures, “Times (or years) of Restitution.” The acceptable day for the Church’s sacrifice has lasted for nearly nineteen centuries. And we know how long the “Times of Restitution” will last—a thousand years. The Apostle Peter tells us just when these ‘‘Restitution Times” will begin. They did not egin in his day. They have not begun yet. They will begin as a result of the Second Advent of Jesus the Messiah, and the establishment of His Kingdom and righteousness, “Times of refreshing shall come from he presence of the Lord and He shall send Jesus Christ, as before was preached unto you, whom the heavens must retain until the Times of Restitution of xll things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began. For Moses verily said unto the fathers, A Prophet like unto me (of whom I am</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">but a type or figure) shall the Lord your God raise up unto you from amongst your brethren. Him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever He shall speak unto you. And it shall come to pass that the soul that will not obey that Prophet shall be destroyed from amongst the people” (Acts 3:19-23)—in the Second Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This great Prophet has been in pro--cess of raising up for now nearly nineteen centuries. And when the last member of His Body shall have passed beyond the veil, He will stand forth in the glories of His Kingdom to rule, judge, instruct, restore and bless all the families of the earth with opportunity for restoration to all that was lost in Eden and redeemed at Calvary., These “Restitution Times” are beautifully referred to in a poem known to many of our readers, written by one who was identified with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Christian Standard </span><span class="font5">office brethren:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A thousand years, earth’s coming glorys *Tis the glad day so long foretold;</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">the promised Seed of Abraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From this viewpoint we can see why God’s long-promised blessing has not yet reached the world, but from this viewpoint we can also see that He is merely selecting or electing the Church, the Seed of Abraham. The promise to Abraham is, “In thy Seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed,” and, as we have seen, the Seed of Abraham is “Jesus the Head and the Church His Body.” In a word, our previous view of the Divine Plan was too narrow. We saw the election of the Church, but did not see God’s gracious purposes for “All the families of the earth.” The Church, as the Scriptures declare, is merely a “first-fruits” unto God of His creatures and is not, by any means, the entire harvest. Let us here re-</span></p>

By disobedience he first lost his fellowship with God, then his Eden home, and after nine hundred and thirty years of toiling with thorns and thistles in sweat of face, the death penalty upon him reached completion —he died. Adam’s race, sharing his weaknesses by laws of heredity, have also shared death with him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">No Second Chance In This</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It might indeed be said in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">one sense </span><span class="font5">of the word that since Father Adam was placed on trial in Eden with a reward of eternal life before him or a penalty of death, and that since he lost his chance of eternal life by disobedience, therefore any chance of eternal life coming to him or to any member of his race would, of necessity, be a second chance. This is undoubtedly true. .From </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">this standpoint </span><span class="font5">every member of the human family must eventually have a second chance for eternal life, because it was for this very purpose that our Redeemer left the heavenly glory, was made flesh, dwelt amongst us and “died, the Just for the unjust.” Whoever enjoys this second chance must expect no more, because “Christ dieth no more.” But, as we have already seen, nobody had a second chance for eternal life prior to the coming of our Redeemer Into the world. “He brought life and immortality to light.” He died, the Just for the unjust, to make recon</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">love of God is being perfected in us, the true, benevolent love which the Lord commands. The Lord said that we should love one another as He has loved us—to the extent of being willing to lay down our lives for one another. We are not to love </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">some </span><span class="font5">of the brethren </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">some of the time, </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">some </span><span class="font5">of the brethren </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">all of the time; </span><span class="font5">but we should </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">love all of the brethren all of the time; </span><span class="font5">and overlook their frailties and imperfections, taking that high standpoint from which God views them, forgiving one another, as God, for Christ’s sake, overlooks </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font5">blemishes. We ought to forgive those who trespass against us as we hope and trust that God will forgive our trespasses. No one can be of the “elect” class unless this love be perfected in him. He may not gain so full a control of the flesh that he will never speak sharply, hastily, etc., but he must reach the place where he will be perfect in intention before he can</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">abstaining from evil and loving our neighbor as ourselves would not fulfil the Law as given to the New Creature by the Lord; but it would fill the Law of Justice given to the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But our Lord magnified that Law and also gave us a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">new </span><span class="font5">command. The Love that should be in His followers, His disciples, was shown in His words, “Love one another as I have loved you.” (John 15:12.) To do this would be far more than to do no injury to another. It would be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">laying down our lives </span><span class="font5">for one another. This is far beyond any requirement of the law. Justice could not say, “You must go over and clean the snow from your neighbor’s pavement”; but Justice would say, “You must not throw any snow upon your neighbor’s pavement.” But Love says more than this. The new Law that is given to us is the Law of Sacrifice. We who are in the Body of Christ must love one another as Jesus loved us, to the extent of sacrificing our interests, our comforts, our privileges^ in the interest of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He who does not find his heart in harmony with this Law of the New Creation—love, mercy, kindness, gentleness, goodness—lacks the evidence, or proof, that he is in any sense accepted of God as a joint-heir w;ith Christ. If we have not love </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">tn</span><span class="font5"> our heart for the brethren, and the love of gentleness and benevolence toward all men, and even toward the brute creation, we have not the spirit which will carry us through in making the sacrifices necessary under present conditions. It will be only a question of time with such when the power of pride or vainglory holding them in</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">salvation of the Church; that was an incidental feature. The Church is selected that as the Bride or Queen during the Messianic Kingdom she may be associated with her Lord, the King, as the Seed of Abraham, in the-bles-sing, the saving, of Adam and his family, or so many of them as shall be willing, from sin and death conditions. We remember the Master’s words to the effect that “He came to seek and to save (recover) that which was lost.” We have just seen that it was a human life, human perfection and an earthly home that were lost. It is these, then, that Jesus proposes in due time to recover for Adam and his family. The Messianic reign of Jesus and His Body—the Anointed, The Christ, The Messiah—will be for the purpose of blessing Adam and all of his race with glorious opportunities of an earthly salvation. The uplifting, restoring influences of Messiah's Kingdom will affect not only Adam and his race, but also the earth itself.

For four thousand years there were promises looking forward to this great Messianic Deliverer, but only promises— nothing was accomplished. Finally, in due time, God sent forth His Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He says that “He came not to condemn the world (not to add to its condemnation, not to add to its sorrow or pain or trouble or hopelessness), but that the world through Him might be saved” from death—have life, perfect and everlasting, deliverance from the jaws of the monster and from his prison-house. But although more than eighteen centuries have since elapsed, the race is being swallowed up of this great monster, death, more voraciously than ever—ninety thousand every day. His prison-house, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sheol, hades,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">every nation and every system or ■ element contrary to the Divine stan- : dards of righteousness will be broken to shivers with His “iron rod.” Thus will righteousness be established in the • earth in the midst of “a time of trouble such as never was since there was a ■ nation.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the putting .down of sin will be ■ but the beginning of Messiah’s work. , Satan being bound, and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">reign of sin </span><span class="font5">thus estopped, each transgression ' will receive a just recompense and each good endeavor a just reward. Gradually mankind will rise out»of sin and therefore proportionately . come from under the power of death, until ' all the willing and obedient shall be fully delivered from all danger as respects the monster which has devoured our race for sixty centuries. Not only so, but those twenty thousand millions who have gone into the prison-house of ddath will be released—• not all at once, but gradually, as .the Apostle declares, “Every man in his own order,” or band.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the close of the thousand years of Messiah’s reign, His victory over Sin and Death will be complete. Every member of Adam’s race will have been lifted from the prison-house of death. It will be a prison-house no longer, for there will be no prisoners in it; mankind will have been lifted out of the clutches of Sin and Death, weakness and depravity, by the processes of restitution, resurrection, uplifting. (Acts 3:19-23.) The victory over sin will be</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Thus, as the Apostle says, with the culmination of Christ’s Kingdom, with the deliverance of all mankind from the power of Sin and Death, death will be swallowed up in victory. The Apostle probably quoted from Hosea xiii, 14, where we read, “I will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ransom </span><span class="font5">them from the power of the grave </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(sheol); </span><span class="font5">I will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">redeem </span><span class="font5">them from death; O death, I will be thy plagues (gradual destruction) ;O grave </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(sheol), </span><span class="font5">I will be thy destruction; repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.” The Almighty will never change or turn from this decision. Death and the grave, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sheol, hades </span><span class="font5">(the Bible hell), are to be destroyed. Every member of Adam’s race is to be delivered by Him who redeems all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Keys of Death and Hades</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A key is a symbol of authority &lt;xnd symbolizes a legal power to open the prison-house and to release the prisoners. Adamic death has been a legal penalty upon our race—a just penalty. But although all shared the condemnation and weakness, God foresaw that some of the race, if granted the opportunity, would gladly return to loyalty to His laws. He has, therefore, made provision through Jesus for every member of the race, great and small, rich and poor. World-wide redemption will be provided and world-wide opportunity for the coming to a knowledge of the Truth and for being uplifted, or resurrected will be afforded. The right or power to release mankind from the power of death and from the prison-house of the tomb, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sheol, hades, </span><span class="font5">the grave, is represented by the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">key </span><span class="font5">in the hands of Messiah. He gained that key, that rightful authority to set us free from the grave, by the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">redemption </span><span class="font5">which He accomplished at Calvary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This figure of the prison-house was</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>

<div>
<p><span class="font5">sufficient for His work? Was His sacrifice imperfect and unsatisfactory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures assure us that the sacrifice that Jesus offered (Himself) •was a satisfaction, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“ransom-price,” </span><span class="font5">for . .the sins of the whole world. They tell us that the Heavenly Father manifested His approval of the sacrifice when He granted the Pentecostal blessing, .and that Jesus is even now at the Father’s right hand waiting (Heb. 10: -12, 13) until the time shall come when the heathen and the uttermost parts of the earth shall be g’iven to Him, that He may establish His reign of righteousness, blessing the world and releasing all the prisoners of Sin and Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The delay is not in any sense an indication of weakness, nor of any change in the Divine Program. It merely indicates that there is another feature of the Almighty’s purpose which we did not for a time discern. The work is to be a great one. Twenty thousand</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font5">be broken up. And Adam and his <sup>1 </sup>family, not willingly sinners, will all <sup>1 </sup>be set at liberty—restored to human perfection, as the earth will be brought to Edenic perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">O Death, Where is Thy Sting?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Then will be brought to pass </span><span class="font5">the • Divine prophecy, “O, death, where is thy sting? O, grave, where is thy victory?”—1 Cor. 15:55.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must notice when this is to be brought to pass. It is not now true. The sting of death is in us all, for, as the Apostle explains, Sin is the sting of death. And because all have been stung by sin, all are dying. It will require the entire Messianic Age to fully extract from humanity the virus, the sting, of sin by bringing mankind to perfection. Only as the sting of death is removed will the power of death relax, because it is a part </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of, </span><span class="font5">the Divine Law that “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” Death now has its sting. But when that which is perfect shall have come, the sting will be gone, the imperfection and weakness will be gone, the cause for sin will also be gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not now, but </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">then, </span><span class="font5">will be brought </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">pass the saying, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“O, hades, </span><span class="font5">where is thy victory?” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Hades, sheol, the grave, </span><span class="font5">has been having a victory over Adam’s race for over sixty centuries. And its victory will not be entirely overthrown until the Redeemer shall have delivered from the power of the grave </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the last member </span><span class="font5">of the human family—for</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">

<p><span class="font5">Kingdom. The symbolic picture of which this text is a part, describes the establishment of Messiah’s Kingdom, the saints of this Gospel Age be-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">ing- with Him in His throne, in His Kingdom, reigning with Him—a Royal Priesthood.—Rev. 20:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The context further describes tha.t period, in which all mankind shall be brought to a knowledge of the Truth, when all shall “stand before the great White Throne,” Messiah’s Judgment Throne, to be tried, to be tested, to be proven whether they will accept or refuse the perfection and eternal life which Divine mercy will then make possible for them. During that thousand years of Messiah’s reign, as we have seen, death will be gradually swallowed up in victory. , And as the prisoners of the tomb are gradually released, the grave will be destroyed, will be no more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The statement, “death and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">hades </span><span class="font5">were cast into the lake of fire, which is the Second Death,” is merely another way of explaining to us that Adamic death, and the grave connected therewith, will be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">superseded </span><span class="font5">by the Second Death. Any of the race who, by the close of the Mediatorial reign, shall not have come up to perfection and shall not have gotten entirely free</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">cessary for all. Whoever then shall come short of eternal life will himself only be to blame. And the trial time over, any not fully delivered, any still held by sin, will be willingly held, and all such will be turned over to the Second Death, destruction, symbolized by fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let it be remembered that the valley of Hinnom, outside of Jerusalem the earthly, where only the vile refuse was destroyed, will find its antitype in the Second Death, symbolically represented as a lake of fire outside the New Jerusalem. In it will be consumed utterly, completely,. everything out of harmony with the Divine will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Wicked Returned to Sheol</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the New Testament, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">as we have </span><span class="font5">seen, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">hades </span><span class="font5">stands for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">grave or </span><span class="font5">state of death, which results from Adam’s transgression; while </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Gehenna </span><span class="font5">represents the Second Death, which will come only upon those who shall first have been delivered from the Adamic sentence, or shall </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have had </span><span class="font5">at least a full opportunity for deliverance and who will manifest their love for sin more than for righteousness and who, therefore, will be sentenced to the Second Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But in the Old Testament there is no distinctive word used to represent the Second Death—the extinction which will be the penalty of personal, wilful transgression. To meet the difficulty the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sheol </span><span class="font5">is used a. second time. For instance, we read of some who will be wilfully wicked<sup>1</sup> after enjoying a knowledge of the Truth—not merely inheritors of imperfection and weaknesses which they have not overcome, but intelligently wilful sinners—‘’Th® wicked Shall be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">returned to sheol to</span><span class="font5">gether with all people who forget God” (Psa. 9:17). In our Common Version the prefix </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">re </span><span class="font5">is improperly omitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“wicked” </span><span class="font5">are only those who </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sin </span><span class="font5">against light, knowledge and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">opportu</span><span class="font5">nity, and only tho&gt;se can be said t&lt;S forget God who have once </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">known </span><span class="font5">Him—who have been </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">brought to a </span><span class="font5">knowledge of the Truth and Uaraed from it. Truly the Resurrection Hope is the great theme of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the Bible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Lord, knowing the Father’s will in this : matter, declared, “I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given Me.”—John 17:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The application of the merit of the Ransom for the Church was made when our Lord Jesus “ascended up on High and appeared in the presence of God for us”—the Church class. (Heb. 9:24.) His application of His merit for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">us </span><span class="font5">was manifested by the Pentecostal blessing, which has since continued with all of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“us” </span><span class="font5">class, begetting these to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">new nature, </span><span class="font5">as joint-heirs with our Redeemer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our great High Priest will not make application of His Ransom-merit on behalf of the world until the end of this Age, until He shall have finished the use of it on behalf of the Church —now enabling those drawn of the Father to “present their bodies living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to God, their reasonable service.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During this Age, He accepts, therefore, as part of His own sacrifice, the offering of the Church.. This enables, this class, as referred to by the Apostle (Col.&quot; W.K '‘to fill W that which </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">another. The Ransom-price for all was provided by our Lord in the work finished by Him at Calvary. The appropriation of the Ransom-price is twofold:—</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(1) In this Age, for or on behalf of, the Church.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(2) In the coming Age, for the sealing of the New Covenant with Israel, which will be open for acceptance by all the families of the earth—all nations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The Atonement, so far as God is concerned, all proceeds from the Ransomprice provided at Calvary. The first application of that price was made after our Lord ascended up on High, when he appeared for us, His Church. The second application of the Ransomprice will be at the close of this Age, when, as the Great Priest, he will mediate the New Covenant with the House of Israel and the House of Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This New Covenant is different from, the Covenant under which the Church is developed, namely the Abrahamie Covenant, which has no mediator, and which is a Covenant of sacrifice, while the New Covenant is a Covenant ol Restitution, to return man to his. orig-, inal condition of. perfection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Rev. Mr. Meyer, who has just celebrated his sixty-sixth birthday, is England’s most eloquent and scholarly Baptist churchman, and his position enables him to speak with authority on the alleged decadence of Christianity in John.

Its scientific lessons brought forth during the past fifty years by astronomers and other scientists are still more wonderful, but most wonderful of all to us are its prophetic teachings, first brought to our attention by Prof. Piazzi Smyth, Astronomer Royal for Scotland, and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Pyramid is located on an elevated, level plain overlooking the river Nile. Peculiarly, the delta of the Nile forms a sea coast, which in shape is a true quarter circle, with the Great Pyramid marking the center angle. This was discovered by iMr. Mitchell, of the United States Coast Survey, in 1808. He observed the regularity of the curvature around the whole of Egypt’s northern urements across the base, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">N, E. </span><span class="font5">to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">S. W., </span><span class="font5">and N. W. to S. E., give as many inches as there are years in the precessional cycle of the stars. This cycle astronomers had already concluded to be 25,827 years, and the Pyramid corroborates the conclusion. The distance to the sun is indicated by the height and angle of the Pyramid to be 91,840,270 miles, which almost exactly corresponds with the latest figures reached by astronomers. The Pyramid also has its own way of indicating standards of weights and measures, based upon the size and weight </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Rev. Joseph iSeiss observed, “There is yet a grander thought </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">em</span><span class="font5">bodied in this wonderful structure. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Of </span><span class="font5">its five points there is one of special preeminence, in which all its sides </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and ex</span><span class="font5">terior lines terminate. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is the sum-</span><span class="font5">at the date of the Great Pyramid’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">build</span><span class="font5">ing * * * the Pleiades were distributed over the meridian of this Pyramid, with Alcyone precisely on the line. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Here, </span><span class="font5">then, is a pointing of the highest </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">sublimest character that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">mere human </span><span class="font5">Science has ever been able to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">so much </span><span class="font5">as hint, and which would seem </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to breathe </span><span class="font5">an unsuspected and mighty meaning </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">into </span><span class="font5">that speech </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Job, when </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he demanded, </span><span class="font5">‘Canst thou bind the sweet influences </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Pleiades?”’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GREAT PYRAMID A DIVINE ORACLE.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(.Continued from 1st page, 4th column.) </span><span class="font5">is plain when once we perceive that the 'Pyramid pictures the history of the world. The Downward Passage represents the downward course of sin and death of the human race under “the Prince of the power of the air,” under “the god of this world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">History in general corroborates this. The lower part of the passage ceases to be. downward, and becomes horizontal to the large chamber in which it ends. That chamber, wide and high, but with troubled floor, may well be understood to represent the time in which we are living—the time in which the downward-ness of our race has been measurably arrested, and when mankind are comparatively freed from the superstition which bowed down our forefathers; but the uneven floor indicates “a time of trouble,” into which we believe we have already entered. Theological, social, political and financial troubles are in the pathway of humanity, and this means such anarchy as has been threatening in</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Spiritual Lessons Here Taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A key suggested in 1868 by a young Scotchman, Robert (Menzies, and which began to open the Pyramid’s religious lessons, was the Well. He wrote </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">Prof. Smyth, “From, the north beginning of the Grand Gallery, in upward progression, begin the years of our Savior’s life, expressed at the rate of a year for an inch. Three and thirty inch-years therefore bring us right over against the mouth of the Well.” In other words, that Well and the appearance of an explosion, picture our Lord’s death and resurrection. In harmony with this the Downward Passage represents the course of sin and death, leading to destruction. The low .Ascending Passage, blocked by the Granite “Plug,” represents the Law •Covenant given to the Jews, but Which none of them were able to keep perfectly, because “there is none righteous, no, not one”—none capable of fulfilling the demands of God’s Law because of hereditary weaknesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the time of our Savior the Gospel Dispensation began, symbolically represented by the Grand Gallery. It is a Dispensation of grace or favor; nevertheless, its Passageway is steep and narrow, leading to the “Goal” at the farther end. As the Grand Gallery has an end, so this Gospel Age will have an end. It will accomplish its purpose, which is the gathering of the “elect” of God, to be the Bride of Christ and His joint-heirs in His Kingdom, which is to bless the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interesting feature is that the Ascending Passage with its Plug represents exactly the length of the Jewish Age 1 And, similarly, the Grand Gallery represents, an inch to a year, the length of this Gospel Dispensation J It indicates that at a certain time the great favor, of becoming joint-sacrificers with the Redeemer, aa-d thus becoming jointheirs with Him in His Heavenly Kingdom, will terminate. The privilege of walking in the “narrow way” off selfsacrifice, in £he footsteps of Jesus, for the Truth’s sake, will thus end. “Now is</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, Brighter and Better Things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Centuries ago an Arabian Caliph, Al Mamoun, believing the Pyramid to contain great wealth, spent a fortune in digging into its interior, not knowing of its Entrance Passage, which at that time may have been covered with the casing stones. He finally reached the Downward Passageway, but behold, the strenuous labors of his workmen dislodged </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">stone in the roof of the Downward Passage, and showed an Upward Passage, left concealed when building the Pyramid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Al </span><span class="font5">Mamoun’s men found that Upward Passage blocked with a large granite block which they were unable to dislodge; and it is still there. Eager for treasure, they worked their way around it and found above it an Ascending Passage of about the' same height as the Descending Passage, which ends in what is 'known as the Grand Gallery. It has the same steep grade as the Ascending Passage. It is narrow at the base, but wider higher up, and seven times as lofty as the Ascending Passage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The interior of the walls of these passages is of creamy marble or limestone, and the Grand Gallery has seven overlappings on each of its side walls, and both the lower and end walls overhang. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font5">its upper end is the Ante-Chamber. Through another low Passage we enter •what is known as the King’s Chamber. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font5">the juncture of the low Ascending Passage with the Grand Gallery, is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">level Passage which leads off to what is known as the Queen's Chamber, directly 'Under the King’s Chamber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus the low Ascending Passage, the low Horizontal Passage, and the floor </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the Grand Gallery, all come together at one point, and there we find what is known as the Well, an irregular Passage which leads downward and connects with the Downward Passage toward its lower end. This Well and the Passage • leading to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Queen’s Chamber apparently were secreted by the builders; but something like an explosion tore away the top stones covering the Well and the lower portion of the Grand Gallery, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">thus disclosed the Well and also the Passage to the Queen’s Chamber. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">So </span><span class="font5">far for our description.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">the acceptable time”—now is the time when God is willing to accept these living sacrifices, which He declares are “holy and acceptable to God” (Rom. 12: 1), through the imputation of Jesus’merit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The King’s Chamber Granite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But while the Grand Gallery as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">whole stands as a representative </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font5">entire Gospel Age, at its top we have illustrated the steps necessary to be taken by each and every one who would constitute </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">member of the Bride class, to become new creatures, to become partakers of the divine nature, sacrificing all that appertains to our human nature. The Ante-Chamber represents the present life of God’s consecrated children. Its peculiar wainscoting seems to symbolically say that lessons must be learned by each one who enters—in other words, it symbolizes the .School of Christ, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">which consecrated believers have lessons of faith, experience, patience and fortitude to prove their worthiness to pass beyond into Heaven itself, represented by’ the King’s Chamber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before entering this Ante-Chamber, or school, the pupil must stoop low, for it is entered by a low Passage, implying humility. And no sooner has he risen than he finds himself confronted by a huge granite obstruction, known as the Granite Leaf, and he can make no further progress except by bowing low to</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">And here another lesson is taught. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">From </span><span class="font5">the moment the pupil bows under 'the Granite obstruction he begins to tread </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font5">the same Granite floor which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">consti</span><span class="font5">tutes the floor of the King’s 'Chamber.

<p><span class="font5">The passage leading from the.

<p><span class="font5">If, as we believe, God has in this great mountain of stone caused to be outlined the Divine Plan of the Ages, it undoubtedly will tell its wonderful story in trumpet tones, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“in that day.”</span><span class="font5"> What </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font5">can appreciate of its teachings </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in har</span><span class="font5">mony with the Bible we find wonderfully comforting in this day when skepticism is so rife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this time, particularly, it is refreshing to Christian faith to find not only the Bible itself opening before us. and one quotation illuminating another and all uniting in the testimony that God is Love, but that the Messianic Kingdom so long promised </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">is. at</span><span class="font5"> Aand^nd that it- -will bring, as foretold, great joy to all people, with the best opportunity for returning to Divine favor and everlasting life. At this time it refreshes our hearts to note the testimony of God’s great Stone Witness in the land of Egypt—• testifying to Divine foreknowledge of the evil that has been upon the world, and respecting the Divine arrangement for the election of the Church, and through it, as 'Messiah’s Kingdom, the blessing of every creature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">P</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">EACE </span><span class="font5">is defined to be a state of quiet, or tranquility, freedom from disturbance or agitation—calmness, repose. Such a state of mind our text affirms of God. His is a mind tranquil, calm, undisturbed, never agitated, nor even, wearied nor perplexed by any of the cares of His vast dominion. Yet this (perfect </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">peace </span><span class="font5">of God. the (Scriptures show, is due neither to the fact that there are no disorders in His vast domain, nor yet </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">any stoical indifference to pain or plea</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">sure, but </span><span class="font5">rather to that perfect poise of His glorious attributes which makes Him Master of His situation as Sovereign of the whole Universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Have we admired the coolness and calm eelf-possession of a great general, such as Grant or Napoleon, in the midst of the confusion and smoke of battle? or of a great statesman, such as Gladstone or Bismarck, in the midst of national perplexities and perils? or of skilled physicians or others in critical times and places? These are only faint illustrations of the peace of self-possession and self-confidence which rules in the mind </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">God. He is never confused, bewildered, perplexed, anxious or care-worn, nor in the least fearful that His plans will miscarry or His purposes fail, because all power and wisdom inhere in Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The scope of His mighty intellect reaches to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">utmost bounds of possibility,</span><span class="font5"> comprehends all </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">causes</span><span class="font5"> and discerns with precision all </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">effects;</span><span class="font5"> consequently, He knows the end from the beginning, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">that, not only from philosophical principles, but also by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">intuition.</span><span class="font5"> .As the Creator of all things and the originator </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">all law, He is thoroughly, acquainted with all the intricate subtleties of physical, moral and intellectual law, so that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font5">problem could arise the results of which are not manifest to His mind. “God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.”—1 John 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God, the Creator of all things, is also </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">competent Sustainer of all things. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font5">silent grandeur, from Age to Age, the whole physical Universe fulfils His will, without a suspicion of disorder or mis</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">hap ; </span><span class="font5">and the same Power is pledged for its sustenance throughout the eternal </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus from His own vast, inherent resources of Power and Wisdom springs the peace of God. But not . from this source alone is the Divine. peace; for peace is the certain concomitant of inherent goodness. God is the impersonation of every virtue and every grace; and consequently He has the blessed satisfaction and peace of conscious moral perfection as well as inherent Wisdom and Power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Emotional Nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Yet </span><span class="font5">we find this peace of God co-exist</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ing; </span><span class="font5">with much of disorder and trouble. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font5">a Father He shows us that He bears </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">father’s love to all His intelligent creatures—“the whole family [of God] in Heaven and in earth”—and that for His “pleasure they are and were created.” (Ephesians 3:15; Revelation 4:11.) He created them in His own likeness—with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">same mental and moral attributes, so that He might have communion and fellowship with them as sons, and.they with Him as a Father, that, thus, in mutual fellowship and communion, the Creator </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">the creature might find pleasure, happiness and delight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This likeness of God includes in all not only the same mental faculties, but also </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">free exercise of the same in the. formation of character. A creature incapable of thus forming character would not </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be in </span><span class="font5">God’s likeness. And for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">purpose of </span><span class="font5">developing character, the alterna</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tive </span><span class="font5">of good and evil must be placed before him. The right and the wrong principles of action must be discerned and the individual left free to his own choice in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">matter, that the pleasure of God may </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">realized in the virtuous character resultant from the free choice of right</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">eousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">iSince the love of God for His newly created and innocent creatures is akin to, but much stronger than, the love, of an earthly parent for an innocent infant; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">since that loving interest and solicitude does not grow cold, as the creature advances in years, but earnestly, watches </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">the development of the principles and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">fruits </span><span class="font5">of righteousness, it is manifest that, like an earthly parent, God experiences </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">sense of either pleasure </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font5">pain, according as His free, intelligent creatures choose the right course or the wrong. Of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">this we </span><span class="font5">are fully assured, not only by thus reasoning from the fact of His Fatherhood, but also by all of those Scriptures which speak of some things as abominable, displeasing, hateful and despicable to Him and as giving Him no pleasure; which say that His anger burns against them, and that His indignation </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">wrath wax hot, even to their destruc</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tion. </span><span class="font5">Other iScriptures speak of His </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">pleasure, love, </span><span class="font5">joy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">delight in pleasing things—in the principles, of righteousness </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">those who obey them. The appreciation of pleasurable emotions necessarily implies ability to appreciate emotions of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">an opposite character, for pain and plea</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">sure may properly be considered the ebb and flow of the same emotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These exhibitions of the mind of God indicate clearly an emotional nature in the Divine Being, of which fact we might also judge from the realization of our own emotional nature, since man was created in God’s image. No, our great God is nbt a God of stoical indifference, insensible to the emotions of pleasure and of pain; but the perfect poise of His attributes preserves the equilibrium of peace under all circumstances, whether of pain or pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Peace Unbroken by External Discord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With this thought, then, let us consider the circumstances under which the marvelous Peace of God has been perpetually maintained. The deep-laid Plan of God in all His creative works required long </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">aions</span><span class="font5"> [ages] for its accomplishment. Across the vista of Ages He saw in His purpose the glory of an intelligent creation in His own likeness, established in righteousness and worthy of His gift of eternal life. He therein saw the mutual pleasure of the Creator and the creature, and with a peaceful patience He resolved to wait for the glorious consummation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the Plan developed and time rolled on, the free moral agency, of His creatures, misused by ■ some, was enabling them to develop evil characters. By this means discord was introduced into His family—“the family [of God] in Heaven and in earth”—all His creatures, angels and men; and the family was divided, some holding to righteousness and some choosing to do evil. But such a contingency was one of the foreseen necessities of the far-reaching Plan, the glorious.outcome of which was, in the Divine judgment, worth the cost of all the trouble and loss which He foresaw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What a dreadful thing is family discord ! How a prodigal son or a wayward daughter often brings the gray hairs of the human parent down with sorrow to the grave! Ah, the Heavenly Father knows something of such sorrow; for He saw Satan, one of His sons (Isaiah 14: 12), an angel of light, fall as lightning ■from Heaven. (Luke 10:18.) For six thousand years, at least, that son has been in open, defiant rebellion against God, and most actively and viciously engaged in inciting further rebellion and wickedness. God saw many of the angels leave their first estate (Jude 6) and become the allies of .Satan, and then. He saw also the whole human race fall into sin. Did ever any human parent find such a conspiracy?—-so virulent and hateful-spring up in his family? Surely not!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then God found it necessary to perform the unpleasant duties of discipline. In His Justice He must disown the disloyal sons and deal with them as enemies. Though all the while His Fatherly Love was preparing to bless the deceived and fallen ones when the purposes of redemption should restore the repentant to&gt; His favor, Love must be veiled, while only stem, relentless Justice could be manifested. This has been no happifying duty, nor has the attitude of the sinner been pleasing to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consider the Love against which these recreants sinned. Though from God cometh every good and perfect gift, His favors have been despised, His love spurned, His righteous authority conspired against and defied. His character maligned, misrepresented, made to appear odious, hateful, unrighteous and even despicable. Yet, through it all the peace of God continues, and for six thousand years He has endured .this contradiction of sinners against Himself. And still, O wondrous grace! His Love abounds; and it is written that He so loved the world, even while, they were yet sinners, that He gave His Only-Begotten Son to die for them; and that through Him judgment (trial) is also to be extended to those angels that fell, with the exception of iSatan, the leader and instigator of the whole conspiracy—the father of lies.—John 3:16; 1 Corinthians 6:3: Jude 6; Hebrews 2:14; Revelation 20:10, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Peace Compatible With Sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This gift of Divine Love was another indication of the cost to our Heavenly Father of His great and marvelous Plan. Not only did He behold the fall into sin of a large proportion of His family, but their recovery cost the sacrifice of the dearest treasure of His heart, and the subjection of this beloved One to the most abject humiliation, ignominy, suffering and death. Again the illustration of a parent’s love assists us in comprehending the cost of this manifestation of Jehovah’s Love. With what tender and yearning emotions of Love must He have made this sacrifice of His beloved Son, in whom he was well pleased! In addition to all the graces of character manifested since the very dawn of the being of the Logos, was now added the further grace of full submission to the Di</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">vine </span><span class="font5">will, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font5">when the nathway pointed out was one of humiliation and pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ah, did the Father let Him go on that errand of mercy without the slightest sensation of sorrowful emotion? Had He no appreciation of the pangs of a father’s love when the arrows of death pierced the heart of His beloved Son? When our dear Lord said, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death,” and again, “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt,” did it touch no sympathetic chord in the heart of the Eternal? Yea, verily; the unfeigned love of the Father sympathetically shared the Lord’s sorrow.—Matthew 26:38, 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The principle taught in the Divine Word, that true love weeps with those that weep and rejoices with those who rejoice, is one which is also exemplified in the Divine character. The immortal Jehovah could not Himself die for us, His Divine nature being proof against death. And even if He could have died, there would have been no higher power to raise Him out of death. Thus all creation would have been left forever without a Governor, and only disaster and ruin could have ensued. But God could and did sacrifice at great cost to His loving, fatherly nature, the dearest treasure of His heart; and thus He manifested (1 John 4:9) the great Love wherewith He loved His deceived and fallen creatures,. If this sacrifice cost Him nothing, if it were impossible for His mind to realize any painful emotion even under such a circumstance, then the gift of His Son would be no manifestation of His Love; for that which </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">costs</span><span class="font5"> nothing, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">manifests</span><span class="font5"> nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our Lord Jesus also manifested His great sympathy for the Father in the misrepresentation of His character which He has so patiently endured for Ages. It was the one effort of His life' to glorify the Father and to rectify among men the false impressions of His glorious character—to show to men His goodness, benevolence, love and grace, and to lead them to love the merciful God who so loved them, even while they were yet sinners, as to seek them out and to plan for their eternal salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Peace Self-Centered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yes, there has been great commotion in the disrupted family of God—commotion in which the Lord declares He hasi had no pleasure (Psalm 5 :4) ; but, nevertheless, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the Peace of God</span><span class="font5"> has never been disturbed. In the full consciousness of His own moral perfection. His unerring Wisdom, His mighty Power, and with the fullest appreciation of Justice and the keenest and most ardent love of the beauty of holiness, patiently and peacefully, and even joyfully in the midst of tribulation, He has endured the contradiction of sinners against Himself for six thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But during the seventh millennium, according to the Divine purpose, it will be the joyful privilege of our Lord Jesus fully to manifest to all creatures in. Heaven and in earth the Father’s glorious character. Then will the Father rejoice in the grandeur of His finished work and in the evenlasting peace and happiness of His family in Heaven and on earth, “reunited under one Head.”—• Ephesians 1:10.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This blessed consummation will not be realized, however, until the incorrigible fallen sons of God, disowned and disinherited because they loved unrighteousness and would not be reclaimed, shall have been cut off. This will be the last unpleasant duty of the Creator and Father of all, who positively declares that ■it is a sad duty, yet nevertheless one which He will have the fortitude to perform in the interests of universal righteousness and peace. Hear Him: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“As I </span><span class="font5">live, saith the Lord God, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">have </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font5">pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn ye from your evil ways; for why </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">will ye</span><span class="font5"> die?”—Ezekiel 33:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus we see that the Peace of God is compatible with great commotion and with sorrow and pain of any kind; for it is not dependent upon outward circumstances, but upon the proper balancing of the mind and the conditions of a perfect heart. Such peace—the Peace of God—was enjoyed also by our. Lord Jesus in the midst of all the turmoil and confusion of His eventful earthly life. And this brings us to the consideration </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">our Lord’s legacy to His disciples, when 'He was about to leave the world, as expressed in His own words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Peace I leave with you, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">My</span><span class="font5"> peace </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">give unto you: not as the world giveth [in stinted measure or in perishable quality], give I unto you. (Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”— John 14:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Lord’s Last Will and Testament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus with abounding compassion and tenderness, did our Lord, on the last night of His earthly life, bestow upon His beloved disciples His parting blessing, His legacy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace.</span><span class="font5"> It was the richest legacy He had to bequeath, and was one of priceless value. It was the promise of that tranquility of soul, that rest and ease of mind, which He Himself possessed—the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace of God.</span><span class="font5"> It was the same peace which the Father has Himself always enjoyed, even in the midst of all the commotion which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">permission </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of evil has brought about; but </span><span class="font5">it was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not derived</span><span class="font5"> from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8@me source. </span><span class="font5">In Jehovah this peace was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">self-centered; </span><span class="font5">He realized in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Himself</span><span class="font5"> the omnipotence of Power and Wisdom; while the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">peace of Christ</span><span class="font5"> was centered, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> in Himself, but in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God,</span><span class="font5"> by faith in His Wisdom, Power and Grace. So also if we would have the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace of God,</span><span class="font5"> the peace </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christ—</span><span class="font5">“My peace”—it must, like His, be centered in God by faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yes, the peace of Christ was </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a price</span><span class="font5">less legacy. Yet how quickly the stormcloud of trouble, which was even </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">then </span><span class="font5">growing very dark, burst in its fury </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">upon </span><span class="font5">the heads of those very disciples to whom the words were directly addressed. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font5">followed almost immediately the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">gracious </span><span class="font5">bequest, and struck consternation, bewilderment, .confusion, to their hearts </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">shook their faith from center </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to circum</span><span class="font5">ference. Then, where was the peace? While the Lord was speaking the words, the foul betrayer, Judas, was </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">out on his </span><span class="font5">murderous errand. Then followed the agony in Gethsemane, and the terror </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">consternation.among the disciples as they began to realize the fate of their beloved Lord. Soon their almost breathless suspense deepened into more fearful forebodings as He stood aione before </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">His </span><span class="font5">merciless accusers and persecutors in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Hall of Pilate and the Court of Herod, while they were powerless to shield Him, Then came the tragic </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">end—'the horrors </span><span class="font5">of the crucifixion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What Had Become of the Peace?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where was the promised </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">peace</span><span class="font5"> under such circumstances—when, overcome with fear and dread, they all forsook Him </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">fled; and when St. Peter, although anxious to defend Him, was so filled with fear that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">three times</span><span class="font5"> he denied his Lord and with cursing declared that he never knew Him? The explanation is, that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">peace</span><span class="font5"> had not yet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">come;</span><span class="font5"> for as the Apostle Paul tells us, “Where </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">testament</span><span class="font5"> is, there must also of necessity </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">death</span><span class="font5"> of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">testator.</span><span class="font5"> For a testament [a bequest] is of force, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">after men are dead;</span><span class="font5"> otherwise it is of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">no strength at all</span><span class="font5"> while the testator </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">liveth.”</span><span class="font5"> (Hebrews 9:16, 17.) But as soon as the tragic scene was over and the cry, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is </span><span class="font5">finished,” fell upon their eager ears, strange as it may seem, there is evidence ■that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">peace</span><span class="font5"> began to steal into their grieving hearts. The darkened heavens, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">quaking earth, the rending rocks, the torn veil of the Temple—all spoke to them a message of comfort which the world could not receive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the world (Jews and Gentiles, both participating in the crime) the language of these events was that-of Divine wrath and indignation against them. And </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">fear fell upon the people, and the clamor and excitement of that awful day </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">died </span><span class="font5">away, they smote upon their breasts </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">returned to their homes. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Roman </span><span class="font5">centurion and they that were with him, fearing greatly, said, “Truly this </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">wa® </span><span class="font5">the (Son of God!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But to the disciples of the Lord these events spoke a very different language. The cause of their blessed Master </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font5"> cause and it was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God's</span><span class="font5"> cause. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To </span><span class="font5">them these supernatural demonstrations were evidences that God was not regarding this matter with indifference; and though through the veil of darkness they could not read His bright designs, in these events there was a whisper of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three days later hope was revived </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font5">the news of our Lord’s resurrection, confirmed to them by His appearance in their midst. Again forty days later hope was strengthened by His ascension after His parting counsel and blessing and promised return, and the instructions to tarry in . Jerusalem until they received the promise of the Father, the Comforter, the Holy Spirit of adoption, not many days thence-yat Pentecost. Then </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">peace of Christ, the Lord’s rich legacy, began to be realized, and the tarrying days of. prayer and expectancy were days of abiding peace—peace which flowed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">a river. But when on the day of Pentecost the promised Comforter came, the river of. their peace found a deeper bed; and their joy knew no bounds!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Like a river glorious is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God’s perfect </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">peace. </span><span class="font4">Over all victorious in its glad increase. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Perfect;</span><span class="font4"> yet it floweth </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">fuller</span><span class="font4"> every day; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Perfect;</span><span class="font4"> yet it groweth </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">deeper</span><span class="font4"> all the way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Rich Legacy of Peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(But not alone to the early Church was this legacy of peace bequeathed. It is the blessed inheritance of the entire Church, even to the end of the Age. The Lord showed His thought for us all on that very day, when in His prayer He said, “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word.”—John 1.7 :20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'What richer legacy could the Lord have left His beloved people? Suppose He had bent His energies during His earthly life to the accumulation of money; and that in so doing He had amassed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font5">immense fortune to leave in the hands </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">His disciples wherewith to push forward the great work of the Age when He should be taken from them! How soon would it all have vanished, and how poor would be our inheritance to-day! “Th? Man of Sin” would surely have gotten hold of it in some way, and not a vestige of the legacy would have reached this end of the Age. But His rich legacy of neace still </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">abounds</span><span class="font5"> to His people!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Our world for six thousand years has been the battle fieid between the forces </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">light and darkness, truth and error, righteousness and sin.

<p><span class="font5">Our Lord’s ministry of three and a half years was a harvest time to the Jewish people in the close of their Age of favor or “day of visitation.” He said to IHis disciples, “I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor; other men labored and ye are entered into their labors.” (John 4:38.) The plowing and sowing connected with the Jewish Dispensation was in the far past. The Egyptian bondage served to do a plowing work, as also Israel’s escape from that bondage and the forty years of wandering in the wilderness before they reached Canaan. The giving of the Law and the establishment of them as a people, the lessons of their sacrifices, and the exhortations of their Prophets, all constituted a seed-sowing, harrowing and cultivating experience. In the, end of their Age Jesus gathered the ripe fruitage of that experience—those sanctified thereby and developed in character and obedience to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;The crop gathered by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font5">Lord and the Apostles in the Jewish harvest numbered thousands. These were gathered out of Judaism and from under the Law Covenant into Christianity — gathered under a Covenant applying only to, the “Church which is the Body of Christ.” This Covenant, under which they became associated with Messiah, reads, “Gather together My saints (holy ones) unto Me,” saith the Lord, “those who have made </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">Covenant with Me by sacrifice.” (Psalm </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">59 :5.) </span><span class="font5">All coming thus into relationship to Jehovah as members of the Body </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Messiah came by way of, the cross—• through a recognition of their own imperfection, and of Jesus and. His sacrifice as the satisfaction for their sins, a covering for their blemishes, by which alone their sacrifices were rendered “holy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">acceptable to God.”—(Romans 12:1.</span></p>

For eighteen centuries this sowing work, with “harrowing” experiences and various cultivations, has been in progress. Now in turn we have arrived at the harvest of this Gospel Age—the reaping time, the time </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">gathering into the garner—beyond the veil—by the power of the First Resur</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">rection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This attitude is what the Scriptures foretell, “When </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font5"> shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh (upon </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">them.”</span><span class="font5"> It is only “ye, brethren,” who are privileged to have the clearer light respecting present and future conditions. 'We know that we are in the Harvest time of this Age—the reckoning time—the testing time—the time when the “wheat” is to be gathered into the heavenly “garner”—the time when the field is to be cleared of all “tares” in a fiery trouble—'the time when the plowshare of trouble will be run through the world of mankind to prepare the whole world for the New Dispensation just about to (begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Plowman Overtakes the Reaper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Illustrating the Divine methods and the rapid following of events in the Divide Program, the Lord through the Prophet tells us that “the plowman will overtake the reaper.” (Amos 9:13.) So accurately timed is every feature of the Divine Plan that part fits to part and work to work closely. The Harvest of the, present time is the gathering of the fruitage of this Gospel Age—the gathering of the Church of the First-born, whose names are written in heaven”—• those who have made a Covenant with Jehovah by sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Head of the saintly Messiah, developed and glorified eighteen centuries ago, is Jesus. The' members of the Body of this Messiah have been gathered from every nation, first from the Jews and then from all nations. God’s call and selection of saintly sacrificers in this</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">winds of violence, “the powers of the air,” which will shortly be loosed, and which will produce the terrific “storm,” are being held back until the sealing of God’s servants in their foreheads shall have been accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This sealing in the forehead implies an intellectual appreciation of heavenly things, and is intimately associated with the harvest work—the sealed are the ripe wheat being gathered for the heavenly garner. As soon as the sealing work shall have been accomplished the winds, of strife and trouble will be let loose according to the (Master’s declaration, and the result will be a “time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation” —no, nor ever shall be the like again. The awful lessons which will then be learned by humanity will be sufficient for all time. The strife, the hatred, the malignity, the anarchy of that day of trouble are depicted in various places in the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The trouble time impending is indeed, declared to foe a time of Divine wrath, and we must not lose sight of that feature of it. Divine Justice has indigna-' tion against in-equity and selfishness in general, for selfishness is but another name for sin. All sin is selfish, and all selfishness is sin. The captains of industry, the captains of education, and captains of wealth have to-day greater</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">(Similarly, there are leaders of the people, presidents and secretaries of unions, etc., who are also captains, and who also have great responsibility. All perceive that 'the world of humanity is rapidly nearing a crisis. The almost miraculous opening of the eyes of understanding which God has recently granted has (brought to the world mechanical inventions and chemical processes which are making the world rich with amazing rapidity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although these blessings are in considerable measure reaching the masses of mankind and uplifting all to a higher plane of comfort, nevertheless general education has opened the eyes of human understanding correspondingly. “The common people” are looking with amazement at the luxury of the rich as the barbarians of old looked upon the much lesser splendors of Rome. They are covetous, they are hungry for what they term their “share” of the bounties being dispensed by Providence with so lavish a hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even if the vast increase of wealth</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">would satisfy these new-born minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Two Possible Solutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">, There seem to be two possible solutions : (1) To convert all of the wealthy into saints, whose pleasure it would be to administer the flood of wealth now rolling in upon them for the general blessing of mankind, along the' most benevolent lines imaginable, or (2) to convert into saints the masses of mankind and to so imbue them with heavenly hopes and prospects that they would not particularly care for earthly good things nor crave them, but rather rejoice to be “the poor of this world, rich in faith, heirs of the heavenly Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We confess that neither solution seems to be practicable. We cannot believe that either can be accomplished; hence we must believe what the Bible teaches, that an awful conflict is about to be precipitated between these two classes, because neither one nor ,the other can be fully converted to the Lord’s way. How gladi we are that the Bible shows that the culmination of the conflict Will bring everlasting peace—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a.</span><span class="font5"> just, loving, equitable and satisfactory adjustment of earth’s affairs, under 'Messiah’s glorious reign </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">a thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Divine Arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Someone may ask, Would not these same difficulties beset any new government which Messiah or others might institute? Will not the element of selfishness forever persist in the human heart, and will not this imply that to all eternity there will be a strife of selfish interests? We answer, No. The Divine Plan solves the problem perfectly. Jesus has demonstrated His unselfishness as respects earthly things. His laying down of His life not only proved His loyalty to righteousness and to the' Father’s will, but proved also His unselfishness—His love—“greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.”—John 15 :13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This Friend of humanity is to be the great King of the world in the New Dispensation, and His associates in the Kingdom, the Bride class, are to be such only as have His spirit and disposition of obedience to the Father’s will—self-isacrifice and love for fellowman—unselfish love. Under present conditions these may not always be known, nor their true character and unselfishness be discerned, because they have the treasure of the new mind in “earthen vessels” which do not always fully represent their true benevolence of heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Divine provision is that such </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">these as shall demonstrate their unselfishness of heart and loyalty to the Lord shall be given new bodies in the resurrection—“sown in weakness, they will </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">raised in power; sown in dishonor, raised in glory; sown an animal body,” with Adamic weaknesses and fleshly imperfec-</span></p>

These will enable us to judge of the right and the wrong of such of our words, thoughts and acts , as may not be particularly specified in the Lord’s Word. Indeed, as we come to understand and sympathize with the principles of Divine Law, to *hat extent we are getting the spirit of Lie Divine Word. Note the testimony of the Psalmist on this point, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“O </span><span class="font5">how love I thy law 1 it is my meditation all the day. Thou, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">through thy commandments,</span><span class="font5"> hast made me wiser than mine enemies, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">for they are ever with me. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">have more understanding than all my' </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">precepts</span><span class="font5"> I get understanding; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">therefore, I hate every false way.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Not Trust to Conscience Alone</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shun a contentious and fault-finding disposition as contrary to the spirit, or disposition of Christ—contrary to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love. </span><span class="font5">A certain amount of combative courage is demanded in overcoming the world, the flesh and the Devil and their various snares. This fighting disposition may become a valuable aid to ourselves and to the Master’s cause if rightly and wisely directed against sin, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font5"> in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ourselves </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">secondly</span><span class="font5"> in others; if used for the 'Lord and his people and against (Satan and all his powers of darkness and superstition.

Their attempt to grasp the rudder of the world’s affairs shows an entire lack of appreciation of the mighty influences with which they<sup>1</sup> seek to contend. Their efforts will merely precipitate upon themselves and upon others the terrible trouble which the Scriptures foretell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'God’s people are distinctly warned that they must keep hands off, must not interfere with the powers that be; their reliance must be upon the Lord and not in the use of carnal weapons. St. James, writing on this subject, declares the coming trouble and tells that it will be? specially severe upon the rich: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Go to </span><span class="font5">now, ye rich men; weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.” (James 5 :1.) No doubt the troubles will be equally upon the poor; but to them ■they will seem less severe since they have been accustomed to less. To God’s people is the message, “Be patient, brethren, the coming of the Lord draweth nigh”; “Wait ye upon Me, saith the Lord.” (Zephaniah 3:8.) “Seek meekness, seek righteousness, it may be that ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.”—&lt; Zephaniah </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2 :3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">you would have no need of the Scriptures.

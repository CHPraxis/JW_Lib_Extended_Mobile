<p><span class="font15">“If the Wesleyans and the Church of England should reunite in the land of Wesley, what effect would it have on the Methodist body in this land?” asks The Literary Digest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;The Churchman” (New York) hopes that the present discussion of the projected union in England will result in the drawing together of two separated religious communions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“The Guardian” (London) publishes </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font15">letter from a Methodist clergyman, in which he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“We are asking whether the Church of England will allow Wesleyan ministers either to receive conditional ordination or, alternatively, to be ordained in a formula which would substitute the words ‘Church of England’ for the words ‘Church of God’ in the Prayer-Book formula. We are asking whether confirmation might, during a period of transition, be regarded as a domestic institution, not to be too rigidly enforced upon adult outsiders. We can see that some concessions must be made for the sake of healing our unhapnv divisions, and many of us are prepared, with that end in view, to accept reordination, even sans phrase if that should be absolutely necessary.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">METHODISM IN HOLY WRIT</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">As might have been expected, all the prominent Protestant systems are brought to” our attention in the Revela-tor’s depiction of the Papacy and the Reformation. To whatever extent the “daughters” have followed the course of the Mother Church in hiding the increasing light of Truth which discredits their time-worn creeds, to that extent the Lord has held them in derision. The following is the exposition of Revelation 9:1-12, in “THE FINISHED MYSTERY,” announced on page 4 of this paper:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">9:1. And the fifth angel sounded.— The Reformation trumpets are referred to, four of which had sounded previous to the one here mentioned. The Lutheran, Anglican, Presbyterian and Baptist movements preceded the Wesleyan, which is now represented in fifteen kinds of Methodist organizations.—1 Cor. 3:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">And I saw a star.—John Wesley became a star in the Anglican heavens in 1728, at which time he was ordained a priest by Bishop Potter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Fall from heaven unto the earth.— Brother Wesley tore a large-sized hole in the ecclesiastical heavens when he began the manufacture of a firmament of his own. His work grew rapidly, particularly in America. Says the Encyclopedia Britannica, “The preachers in the South determined upon administration of the sacraments, and a committee was chosen who ordained themselves and others. John Wesley, aided by two presbyters of the Church of England, early in 1784, ordained Thomas Coke, a presbyter of that Church, as Superintendent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In 1787 the American Conference changed Mr. Coke’s title to “Bishop.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">It must have been a strange sight to see a bright man like Wesley engaging those two presbyters of the Church of England to help him ordain somebody to a higher office than any of them had ever held. But the plan worked. All Methodists believe that Bishop Coke, the first Bishop of the Methodist Church, received some “apostolic succession.” These brethren have been grieved that Pastor Russell did not get his ordination from the same source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">And to him was given the key of the ♦[bottomless] pit fOF THE ABYSS.— Wesley was given the key to nothing and to nowhere.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY CHRISTENDOM MUST NOW SUFFER—THE FINAL OUTCOME</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font15">The following article is extracted mainly from Pastor Russell’s posthumous volume entitled “THE FINISHED MYSTERY,” the 7th in the series of his STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES and published subsequent to his death. Pastor Russell held the distinction of being the most fearless and powerful writer of modern times on ecclesiastical subjects. In this posthumous volume, which is called “his last legacy to the Christians of earth,” is found a thorough exposition of every verse in the entire book of Revelation and also an elucidation of the obscure prophecy of Ezekiel. The book contains 608 pages, is handsomely bound in </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">em</span><span class="font15">bossed cloth, 60c postpaid.

<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font15">HE various prophecies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel and the Apocalypse concerning Babylon are all in full accord, and manifestly refer to the same great city. And since these prophecies had but a very limited fulfilment upon the ancient literal city, and those of the Apocalypse were written centuries after the literal Babylon was laid in ruins, it is clear that the special reference of all the Prophets is to something of which the ancient literal Babylon was an illustration. It is clear also that, in so far as the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah concerning its downfall were accomplished upon the literal city, it became in its downfall, as well as in its character, an illustration of the great city to which the Revelator points in the symbolic language of the Apocalypse (Chapters</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">17 and 1.8), and to which chiefly the other Prophets refer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">As already intimated, what to-day is known as Christendom is the antitype of ancient Babylon; and therefore the solemn warnings and predictions of the Prophets against Babylon—Christendom—are matters of deepest concern to the present generation. Would that men were wise enough to consider them! Though various other symbolic names, such as Edom, Ephraim, Ariel, etc., are in the Scriptures applied to Christendom, this term, “Babylon,” is the one most frequently used, and its significance, confusion, is remarkably appropriate. The Apostle Paul also points out a nominal Spiritual Israel in contradistinction to nominal Fleshly Israel (1 Cor. 10:18; Gal. 6: 16; Rom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">9:8); and likewise there is a nominal Spiritual Zion, and a nominal Fleshly Zion. (See Isa. 33:14; Amos 6:1.) But let us examine some of the wonderful correspondencies of Christendom to Babylon, its type, including the direct testimony of the Word of God on the subject. Then we will note the present attitude of Christendom, and the present indications of her foretold doom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Revelator intimated that it would not be difficult to discover this great mystical city, because her name is in her forehead; that is, she is prominently marked, so that we cannot fail to see her unless we shut our eyes and refuse to look—“And upon her forehead was a name written,. Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and abominations of the earth.” (Rev. 17:5.) But before looking for this Mystical Babylon, let us first observe the typical Babylon, and then, with its prominent features in mind, look for the antitype.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The name Babylon was applied, not only to the capital city of the Babylonian empire, but also to the empire itself. Babylon, the capital, was the most magnificent, and probably the largest, city of the ancient world. It was built in the form of a square on both sides of the Euphrates river; and, for protection against invaders, it was surrounded by a deep moat filled with water and Inclosed within a vast system of double walls, from thirty-two to eighty-five feet thick, and from seventy-five to three hundred feet high. On the summit were low towers, said to have been two hundred and fifty in number, placed along the outer and inner edges of the wall, tower facing tower; and In these walls were a hundred brazen gates, twenty-five on each side, corresponding to the number of streets which intersected each other at right angles. The city was adorned with splendid palaces and temples and the spoils of conquest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Nebuchadnezzar was the great monarch of the Babylonian empire, whose long reign covered nearly half the period of its existence, and to him its grandeur and military glory were chiefly due. The city was noted for its wealth and magnificence, which brought a corresponding moral degradation, the sure precursor of its decline and fall. It was wholly given to idolatry, and was full of iniquity. The people were worshippers of Baah to whom they offered human sacrifices. The deep degradation of their idolatry may be understood from Gods reproof of the Israelites when became <sup>corr</sup>upted by contact with them.—See Jer. 7:9; 19:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Nebuchadnezzar was succeeded In the dominion by his grandson Belshazzar, under whose reign came the collapse which pride, fulness of bread and abundance of idleness always insure and hasten. While the people, all unconscious of impending danger, following the example of their king, were abandoning themselves to demoralizing excesses, the Persian army, under Cyrus, stealthily crept in through the channel of the Euphrates (from which they had turned aside the water), massacred the revelers, and captured the city. Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of that strange handwriting on the wall—“Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin”—which Daniel had interpreted only a few hours before tq mean, “God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it. Thou art weighed in the balance and art found wanting. Thy kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”. So complete was the destruction of that great city that even its site was forgotten and was for a long time uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Such was the typical city; and, like a great millstone cast into the sea. it was sunken centuries ago, never again to rise: even the memory of it has become a reproach and a byword. Now let us look for its antitype, first observing that the Scriptures clearly point it out, and then noting the aptness of the symbolism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Mystic Babylon—“Christendom”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In symbolic prophecy a “city” signifies a religious government backed by power and influence. Thus, for instance, the “Holy City, the New Jerusalem” is the symbol used to represent the established Kingdom of God, the overcomers of the Gospel Church exalted and reigning in glory. The Church is also, and in the same connection, represented as a woman, “the Bride, the Lamb’s Wife,” in power and glory, and backed by the power and authority of Christ, her Husband. ‘•‘And there came unto me one of the seven angels . . . saying, Come hither, I will show thee the Bride, the Lamb’s Wife. And he . . . showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem.”—Rev. 21:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">This same method of interpretation applies to Mystical Babylon, the great </span><span class="font13">(Continued on Page 2, Column 3.)</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

Tne apostate church lost her virgin purity. Instead of waiting, as an espoused and chaste virgin, for exaltation with the Heavenly Bridegroom, she associated herself with the kings of the earth and prostituted her virgin purity—of both doctrine and character—to suit the world’s ideas;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font15">and in return she received, and now to some extent exercises, a present dominion, in large measure by their support, direct and indirect. This unfaithfulness to the Lord, whose name she claims, and to her high privilege to be the &quot;chaste virgin” espoused to Christ, is the occasion of the symbolic appellation &quot;harlot,” while her influence as a sacerdotal empire, full of inconsistency and confusion, is symbolically represented under the name Babylon, which, in its widest sense, as symbolized by the Babylonian empire, we promptly recognize to be Christendom; while in its mere restricted sense, as symbolized .by the ancient city Babylon, we recognize to be the nominal Christian church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Tt has been very generally and very properly claimed by Protestants that the name &quot;Babylon” and the prophetic description are applicable «to Papacy, though recently a more compromising disposition is less inclined so to apply it. On the contrary, every effort is now made on the part of the sects of Protestantism to conciliate and imi-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font15">tate the Church of Rome, and to affiliate and co-operate with her. In so doing they become part and parcel with her, while they justify .her course and fill up the measure, of her iniquities, just as surely as did the scribes and Pharisees fill up the measure of their fathers who killed the Prophets. (Matt. 23:31, 32.) All this, of course, neither Protestants nor Papists are ready to admit, because in so -doing they would be condemning themselves. And this fact is recognized by the Revelator, who shows that all who would get a true view of Babylon must, in spirit, take their .position with the true people of God &quot;in the wilderness”—in the condition of separation from the world and worldly ideas and</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">hand of recompense to that they alsq are to some extent bound in with the. nations of Christendom by various interests, commercial and others; and justly, too, to that they also have failed to appreciate what light they have seen, and have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. Thus, as the Prophet declared, “All the earth [society] shall be devoured with the fire of God’s jealousy” (Zeph. 3:8); but against Babylon, Christendom, because of her greater responsibility and misuse of favors received, will burn the fierceness of His wrath and indignation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">But some sincere Christians, not yet awake to the decline of Protestantism, and who do not realize the relationship of the various sects to Papacy, but who perceive the unrest and the doctrinal upheavals in all the religious systems, may still be anxiously inquiring, “If all Christendom is to be involved in the doom of Babylon, what will become of Protestantism, the result of the Groat Reformation?” This is an important question; but let the reader consider that Protestantism, as it exists to-day, is not the result of the Great Reformation, but of its de-cline; and it now partakes to a large degree of the disposition and character of Rome, from which it sprang.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Babylon—Mother and Daughters</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Protestant sects (and we say it with all due deference to a comparatively few devout souls within them, wnom. the Lord designates as “wheat” in contradistinction to the overwhelming numbers of fares’’) are the true daughters of that degenerate system of nominal Christianity, the Papacy, to which the Revelator makes reference in applying to her the name “Mother of harlots.&quot; {Rev. 17:5.) And let it not pass unobserved that both Romanists and Protestants now freely own the relationship of mother and daughters, the former continually styling herself the Holy Mother Church, and the latter, with pleased complacency, endorsing the idea, as shown by many public utterances of leading Protestant clergymen and laymen. T.ius they “glory in their shame,” apparently all unmindful of the brand which they thus accept from the Word of God, which designates the Papacy as “th© mother of harlots.” Nor does the Papacy, to claiming her office of motherhood, ever seem to have questioned her right to that title, or to , considered its incompatibility with her profession still to be the only true Church, which the Scriptures designate a “virgin” espoused to Christ. Her acknowledged claims of motherhood are to the everlasting shame of bsth herself and her offspring. The true Church, which God recognizes, but which the world knows not, is still a virgin.; and from her pure and holy estate no daughter systems have .ever sprung. She is still a chaste virgin, true to Christ, and- dear to Him as the apple of His eye. (Zech. 2:8; Psa. 3.7:6, .$.) The true Church, cannot be pointed out anywhere as a company from which ail the tares have been separated, but it consists only of .the true “wheat,” and all such are known unto God, whether the world recog-sizes them or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">But let us see how the Protestant systems sustain this relationship of daughters to Papacy. Since Papacy, the mother, is not a stogie individual, but a great religious system, in keeping with the symbol we should expect to see other religious systems answering to the illustration of daughters of similar character—not, of course, </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">go </span><span class="font15">old, or necessarily so depraved, as Papacy, but nevertheless “harlots” in the same sense; i.e., religious systems claiming to be either the espoused Virgin or the Bride of Christ, and yet courting the favor and receiving the . support of the world, at the price of disloyalty, to ;Chrfct. To this description the various Protestant organizations fully correspond. They are the great daughter systems. 'The birth of these-, various daughter -systems came in connection with reforms from the corruptions of the &quot;Mother Church.&quot; The daughter systems parted from the mother under circumstances of travail, and were bom virgins. However, they contained more than true reformers; they contained many who still had the spirit of the mother, and they inherited many of her false doctrines and theories; and it was not long until they fell into many of her bad practices and proved their characters true to the prophetic stigma—&quot;harlots.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">But let it not be forgotten that while the various reformation movements ■did valuable work in the “cleansing of the Sanctuary,” yet only the Temple class, the Sanctuary class, has ever been the true Church, in God’s reckoning. The great human systems called churches have never been more than nominally the ‘Church. They ail belong to a false system which counterfeits, misrepresents and hides from</span></p>

They are th© “wheat” class of our Lord’s parabib, clearly distinguished by Him from the “tares.” Not comprehending ih® real character of these systems, as Individuals they have humbly walked i with God, taking His Word as their I counselor and His Spirit as their ttride. Nor have they ever been at ase in nominal Zion, where they have Often painfully observed that the spirit of the world, operating through the unrecognized “tare” element, endangered spiritual prosperity.' They ar© the blessed mourners in Zion, to whom •God hath appointed “beauty for ashes, and the oil of joy for mourning.” fMatt. 5:4; Isa. 61:3.) It is only in this “Harvest” time that the separation of this class from the “tare” element is due; for it was the Lord’s purpose to “let both grow together until the Harvest [the time in which we ar© /now living].” (Matt. 13:30.) Hence it -is that this class is now being awak-'ened to a realization of the real character of these condemned systems, because the “Harvest,” th© separating time, has come.</span></p>

At tn© time'the division was made the five potential races in the East were: th® Greeks,, Lombards, Ostrogoths,' Heruli and Vandals. The five potential races in th© West Were the Franks, Britons, Saxons, Visigoths and Suevi. During the next one hundred and fifty years great migrations and invasions have so. confused history that there is great difference of opinion among historians on many important details. It is plain, however, that three, of the migratory races disappeared from history, all within a few years oi each other, apparently in order to leave Rome and its environs free for the development of the Papacy. The Heruli, a race from Germanic territory, disappeared from Italian territory in A. D. 489; th© Vandals, a race from the shores of the Baltic (never in control of Rom© except oh a brief raid, but a great enemy of th® Papacy), disappeared in A. D. 534; and th© Ostrogoths, an Asiatic race, in A. D. 539. Th© Western Empire itself disappeared in A. D. 476. The matter is treated by Pastor Russell at greater length in Vol. III. of his “Studies in the Scriptures,” pp. 76, 77, and all his statements are, of course, correct.

It is this entire order of things that is to fall and pass away in the battle of this great day—the order of things which for centuries has held the people docile under the ruling powers, civil, Social and religious. All this has been by God’s permission (not by His appointment and approval, as they claim). But though an evil in itself, it has served a good, temporary purpose in preventing anarchy, which is immeasurably worse, because men were not prepared to do better for themselves, and because th© time for Christ’fe Millennial Kingdom had not yet come. Hence God permitted th© various delusions to gain credence in order to hold men in check until “Th© Time of the End”—the end of “Th© Times of the Gentiles” (which expired in autumn of A. -D. 1914, as shown in Pastor Russell’s “Studies in the Scriptures.” Vol. II., written twenty-five years before the outbreak of the war).</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">The Prophet Ezekiel, as God’s instrument, long centuries ago wrote the history of ecclesiasticism in prophetic language. There the Lord pointed out how the Catholic and Protestant systems would become the antitypical Babylon and would fall. We give here a few extracts from the words of the Prophet Ezekiel and comments thereon taken from</span></p>

Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against the© ch every side.—There* fore, O Protestantism, thus saith the t Lord Jehovah: I will raise up in? warfare and revolution the worldly‘it* people in thee, of whom thou art ' already sick, and bring them against the© on every side.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">The clergy, as a class, have existed since tne third cenuury. Amongst them have been many, good, honest, noble Christian men. But by far the greater majority have been unfaithful, disloyal, unrighteous men. Alas, the unfaithful class prevails at this time, and the great climax has come! God foretold this centuries ago. In chapters 33 and 34 the Prophet Ezekiel scathingly arraigns this class, and points out how they ate responsible in a' greater degree than any other class of men on earth for th© present war and th© great trouble that shall follow.</span></p>

They thus designate themselves. The clergy have an awful responsibility. Faithful watching on their part, with their great influence among the people, would have saved tens of millions from physical death, and a host from the religious death that will overtake </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font15">many. The outraged people will turn upon the clergy, as during the French Revolution, and in a frightful carnival will exact full toll for the lives lost in war. Responsibility for the Time of Trouble lies squarely at the door of ecclesiasticism; for had the clergy taken a united stand upon the Word of God against industrial, social, political, moral and religious evils, they could have reformed Christendom and prevented the world war and the ensuing revolution and anarchy. Our Lord said prophetically, “Upon this generation shall come all the blood,” etc. By long teaching the false doctrine of the Divine right of kings and the Divine right of the clergy, the latter have become more reprehensible and responsible for the war than any other class on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The comment upon Ezekiel 33:11-19 reads, “God has no pleasure in the | destruction of Christendom. If it had I turned from its spiritual idolatry and i harlotry, it would have been saved 1 from its impending doom. Its de-I struction is traceable directly to a</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW BABYLON WILL FALL.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Revelator points out how Babylon (Ecclesiasticism) has become corrupt and how she will fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Revelation 18:1,2. And after these things I saw an angel coming down from Heaven having great power, and the earth was lightened with His glory, and He cried with a mighty voice, saying, Fallen is Babylon the Great.—The expression, “Babylon is fallen” indicates that at some time </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font15">sudden and utter rejection is to come upon Babylon, when all favor will forever cease and when judgments will follow..</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">And is become the habitation of devils.—The New York World publishes an interview with Bishop Fellows, who says, “In recent years great strides have been made in the explanation of psychic phenomena, and in the years to come the science of communication with the dead will be made a part of the curriculum of great educational institutions.” We believe that through this channel the fallen angels (“wicked spirits,” Eph. 6:12) are seeking to break down the human will and will shortly succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">And the hold of every foul spirit. —Rev. William Sunday has exceptional opportunity for knowing about Babv-Ion, and he scores the ministers because they have no faith. He says, “Theological seminaries are turning out infidels,” and refers to the large amount of saloon property that belongs to church members. He would have us believe that the moral standard of thousands high in the hateful bird.-—Babylon has contained both the best and the worst, but the worst have predominated.</span></p>

And I heard another voice from Heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues.—If you fail to obey the Lord through fear of earthly loss it will prove that these things are more precious to you than His favor is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">18:8. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire.—Completely destroyed in revolution and anarchy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">What joy will pervade the earth, when Babylon is completely annihilated! It will be followed by the-glorious Kingdom of Messiah. Long have honest, order-loving Christian people prayed for the coming of that Kingdom. It will be the desire of all nations. Then universal peace will prevail and the people will learn war no more forever. (Micah 4:1-4; Isaiah 2:2-4.) No more will thef earth drink the blood of men slain Xn war* Widows* tears will be dried/and the cry of the orphan shall cease. They will have restored to them their loved, ones who have been taken away by cruel war-gods, pestilence, famine and. death. In beautiful, poetic language the Revelator describes that coming time Of blessing, the beginning of Which is near at hand, saying. “And </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font15">saw the Holy City, the New Jeru-nacle of God is with men, and He dwelleth with them, and they shall be His people and God Himself shall be with them; and He shall wipe-away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying shall be.” What </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">a. </span><span class="font15">glorious sunburst of blessing is in these words! What a grand fulfilment will there be of the Apostle’s declaration respecting the “times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all the holy Prophets since the world </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font15">gan”!

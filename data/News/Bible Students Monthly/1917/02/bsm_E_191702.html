For whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son; that he might be the first-born among many brethren? <sup>9</sup>—Fotn. 8:28, 2Q,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Wmin’f to the land ©f that sturdy iman of God, John Knox, I am remind-?ad of his able contention for to® decline of Election-—Its Scripturalness ®nd its demonstration of the greatness, •majesty and sovereignty of th® Lord ■©ur God. We surmise, however, that the good man’s heart must frequently toive been sorely distressed with the logic of his own argument; that the eternal woe of nine-tenths of ©ur race was as unalterably fixed in advance of their birth as was the eternal joy •of the blessed handful predestinated to.be saints and to share the heavenly glories. We may well thank God, dear friends, thay in the clearer light now shining upon the Scriptures we may fflseern th® wrors handed down t© u® from th® dark ages, without losing our (appreciation of Divine foreknowledge gmd Divine sovereignty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ While it is true that it would be difficult t® estimate the value of the doctrine of Divine foreknowledge taught W Brother Knox, not only in this saffian, but also throughout the world, ba-suleating a reverence for the Almighty, It is also true that St would b® difficult to estimate th® amount ©f damag® which has resulted to Ghrlsteadsm throughout the world from his teachings respecting th® Divia® treatment ©f te® n@n-elect. This serious error tms alienated the hearts ©f th@usa»ds from G®d and from his B@@k. Let us took together at th® doctrines ©f Elec-gfon, Predestination and F©re@rdtea-jtton, from th® Scriptural staadpffiat, ►at we may note their beauties and be grawn the nearer to th® L®rd aa&lt; to ills Bosk in true reverence and w®r-ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Foreknown and Predestinated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">r</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">! Our text declares that whom God did igereknow them he also did predestinate; but w® wtic® that the predestiaatte® is stated ©aly as respects th® Church a»&lt; set in respect t® others. This fact dees sot escape th® attention of others, hut they have reasoned erroneously,—that If G@d foreknew an elect Church, for whom h® predestinated, special blessings ant honors, this would imply that ^he remainder ©f mankind aon-elect swere to be tortured eternally. The logic of this position is unsound and fe is quite unseriptural to say, that all bf the non-eleet will be consigned to an teternity of torture at the hands of fireproof demons in fulfillment of a Dipin® predestination fixed before creation. There is no Scripture whatever &amp;&nbsp;this effect, and Brother Knox and pthers were to error- to the extent -that they wove Into their theories matters pot Scripturally stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">' According to the Scriptures, as well ®s according to human judgment as ex-iPressed in the laws of civilization, the highest, the severest penalty to be enforced, is the death penalty, the taking away of the life not used in harmony with the Creator’s reasonable, righteous requirements. This is the Scriptural declaration to which, for so long a time, we were blind: “The wages of sin is death;” “The soul that sinneth. it shall </span><span class="font3">die;” “All the wicked will he destroy;’* “They shall perish as brute beasts;” “They shall be destroyed with an everlasting destruction” (the Second Death).—Romans vi, 23; Ezekiel xviii, 4; Psalm cxlv, 20; II Peter 11, 12; II Thessalonians I, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus seen the very severest results possible to non-eleetion w@uM be extinction—th.® Second Death. But to® Scriptures clearly show that G®&lt; has gracious purposes, not for th® “elect” ©nly, but also for the non-eteet aad that to his due time the non-elect shall be brought to a clearer knewledg® ®f th® Truth and to a full @pp@rtunl||f®f harmony with their Creator and 'through Christ Jesus th® re-attainmmt of all that was lost in Adam, all that was redeemed by the precious sacrifice ©f Christ. Thus, as the Scriptures declare, there is a “common salvation” (Jude 3) la which ail of Atom’s children shall be privileged to h&amp;v® a share. There is also a special salyatiea, a '“high. calling” of God in Christ, which te referred to as “so great salvation (which began to be (preached) spoken fey the Lord, aad was csnfirmed unto h® by them that heard him.” (Meh. 11, k) This oeeial @r great salvatie® is th® one which our Lord has provided tor th® “Elect,” while th® “e@mm@® 'Salvation” is his provision f©r th® n®a-blect</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 Does It net seem strsag® that ►ether Kaox and ethers, his eoadju-feors, in getting away from much @f iffi® smoks^f the “dark ages,” tailed m even think of a salvation of the Ben-elect as a part of Wft’s providence? |teheir eyes, beholding the awful aa&lt; (blighting errors respecting eternal ter-Iment, totally blinded them t® God’s provisions for the n©n-elect; for they Reasoned that if God had predestinated them to eternal torment and had tn advance of their creation prepared a great place of torture and fire-proof devils and fuel enough for eternity, oen surely b® could have no plan ®f salvation ter them. The entire premise was wrong. The death into which- they went was not eternal terment but the tomb, as represented by the Hebrew word S&amp;eol and th® Greek word Hstio, And they oan ’have a© release from the tomb, no return to gtmactousness or yain or pleasure until the Second Coming of the Redeemer in th® morning ®f the Resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thank God, then, for th® rolling away of th® mists of darkness and error which permits us to see in th® Bible that the “common salvation,” God’s -provision for the world, will be a Restitution, a restoration to human perfection in the rejuvenated earth, a world-wide Paradise’ Thank Goh for the promises to the effect that then “the knowledge ©f the glory of God shall fill the Whole earth as the waters cover the great deep” and that “the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in his beams;” that “nothing shall hurt or destroy or injure in all God’s holy Kingdom;” that “the wayfaring man, though simple, need not @re therein,” and that a broad high-WylSfii be there as a way of Salva-much traveled way—and that aU th® redeemed @f th® L@rd shall be privileged to g® up th®re@n out @f sin and death g®®diti®»s to e©n-ditions ©f life ©veriastiag. W® thaak God, to®, that th©§® wk© shall w. fuse to make proper progress and |haU fall ®f that “cemsaen a&amp;lvatioa” because ©f willful sin will het be permitted to live endlessly In sin, nor In torment, but will be utterly destroyed in th® Second Death; because God is able to destroy both s@ul and body in Gehenna, th® Second Death. W® thank God ata® that th® elect Church, under Christ, th® Captain of their salvation, ar® promised a share ta that glsrious work of th® Redeemer, tn blessing all th® families ©f th® earth ta bringing te them that common (general) salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Y®ur High Calling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If one® w® dreaded to think ®f God’s grace toward us la accepting us as members of his elect Church, because of th® ©pposlag thought of the damnation ©f the noaelect, w® may now correspondingly rej©ice th® ®@re in ©ur privilege ©f electisn, seeing that It means our privilege of sharing in th® world’s uplift under th® direction of Emmanuel, ©ur Lord, during his Millennial reign. The Apestl® speaks of the prospect of the elect a® “our High Calling;” and agate, “our heavenly calling.” Th® ttoraght te that w® ar® called to a very high honor and wonderful distinction and that ®n a heaw&gt; enly plane. The Gespel Church Is invited to experience a chaag® of nature from human to divine, fr@na the high-®st of th® earthly natures to th® highest ®f the heavenly nature®-—far above aageta and principalities and powers and every name that is Mamed-—“joint heirs with Christ,” “partakers ®f the Dteta® nature,” members ©f “th® Bride, th® Lamb’s wif®.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Truly do th® Scriptures tell that not saany would b® able to hear, to appreciate, t® understand, to accept this high calling. The Divine arrangement of th® call te elective, selective. It appeals t® some and dees not appeal to others. It has an attraction tor ®@m® and n@t for others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If w® had her® n box ®f sawdust and scattered through M a paper. ®f tack® until th® latter wsr® quit® hiddrn from view, surrounded and covered in th® sawdust, w@ know that w© ©ould take a magnet and, by passing it to aad fro amongst the sawdust, th® magnet weuld attract to itself ©very tech. It </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">weig</span><span class="font4">ht indeed ixercis® a still further attraction, upon gem® ®f the sawdust, but th© hold would be so slight that w® could blow it off, while the tacks would be firmly held by reason of their responsiveness to the magnetic influence. Th® box of sawdust represents tn® world of mankind. The tacks of the illustration represent a small class ®f humanity, zealous at heart f®r God and for righteousness. The' umgurt represents the Gospel invitation-which is now passed up and down, hitter and thither throughout the civilized world, and to some extent, into the beathea world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not th® design of th® Lord to elect, select, choose, gather all mankind (tne sawdust) by the m^nelj merely h® would now gather tbe truehearted, represented by the specks of steel, the tacks. The illustration migWb be enlarged by supposing some otheE tacks of other metallic composition n@t so subject to the magnetic influence ®S tiie steel. The illustration of these Would repi’esent mixed charactara^sudb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">w® see about us in the world everf-Where. Th® illustration might be ex-t®ad®&lt; to teclud® good tacks covered With dirt or other foreign substance Which would hinder them from r®» Broading to the influence of the maghet and this would represent true char« acterg encrusted with the cares of this life, th® deceitfulness of riches, etc. ■ “Elect according to the foreknowb edge ©f God through sanctification of toe spirit and th® belief of the Trflth,” frites th® Apostle. God designed th® election of this Age. He desired to Separate to Mwelf a peculiar people^ to b© tW associates of Jesus, theis Redeemer, in bte subsequent work of Shifting the willing and obedient of the world of mankind. But God ha® hot predestinated nor desired the elec-ffien of any except a sanctified class^ h class not sanctified through stripes, B©t through force ®r compulsion, bufe sanctified through a knowledge of th® Truth. Such are drawn to God in devotion through a knowledge of his glorious purposes and heart sympathy therein, sufficient to induce them to sacrifice their all, s@ far as earthly matters and iatereste ar® concerned. Thea® ar® the elect, who® the Lord has been searching for and testing with the magnet ©f his Truth, and th® manner of their response to it throughout this Gospel Age &lt;©tarmte®a whether “They shall b@ mine, saith the Lord, in that day when I eom® to mak® up my jewels.”</span></p>

We are distinctly told that Sataa shall b® bound for that thousand years (the Millmnium) that h® may deceive the people no mor© until th® thousand years shall b© finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The question naturally arises, Why did God with all power at his command so long permit Satan to deceive humanity and through their superstitions and ignorance rule them as their Prince? Why was he ©ver given liberty or power at all over humanity? In the light of the Scriptures we may see that as God at times has used th® wrath of man to praise </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mb,</span><span class="font4"> ®© during this period ©f Satan’s liberty h® has not b®ea permitted to frustrate th® </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D1y1b@</span><span class="font4"> Plan or. iatentiea but, unconsciously, has co-operated with it and served it Without his blinding influence th® I©wish raters would not hav® crucified ©ur Lord, as St. Peter distinctly shows, “I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers” (Acts ill, 17).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Likewise had it sot been for th® delusions of Satan th® Church would set bav® been persecuted; the way to glory and honor and immortality and ^ctat-hetohip with Christ would not have been mad® th© “Narrow way;” th® saints, th® “jewels” whom th® Lord is now selecting, would not have been pdfched and fitted and prepared for th® glorious places to which th® Lord has called them. Surely, then, th© Lord has used the great Adversary to amfet in th© accomplishing of th® DMn® purposes. Satan may hav® supposed that he wag frustrating God’s plans, but just as surely he was mistaken.

<p><span class="font4">Attempting to give us glimpses of th© glory that is to come the Scriptures use various figures of speech, telling us, for instance, that the present is a dark night as compared to the future, which will b© a morning of joy. They declare, “Weeping may endure for the night, but joy cometh in the morning”—the Millennial morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following th® same figure we read, <sup>w</sup>The Sun of Righteousness shall arise With healing in his beams.” From this Standpoint the entire six thousand years of the reign of sin from the time pf Adam’s disobedience in the Garden</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Th® Qulek ®nd th® 0®®d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Th© proposition of the Scriptures, a Milleimial Age of blessing, eomtag through th© establishing of God”® Kingdom, for which we pray, “Thy will b® d@n@ to earth as it is don® ia heaven,” strikes people in thre® different ways;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">First.—ungenerously will W disposed to rerent th© thought uudw th© supposition that it would imply a mor® favorable opportunity for th® world In general to the next Age to com® into tarmony with God than th® Church of the present age enjoys.

Th© reward of th® Church will be &amp;&nbsp;spirit nature and a share in the heavenly Kingdom with th® Lord Jesus.} Th® reward ©f th® earthly class of faithful ones will be Restitution to th®<sup>1 </sup>perfection of human nature lost by Adam and redeemed by our Lord J®«</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Seeoad.—Another class, generous audj appreciative, offer the criticism that if I seems unfair on God’s part to givw such a glorious Millennial opportunity] to thos® who will be living at the tim@j ©f th® Second Advent and to deny it! to th® remainder of the race who lived; previously. This also is a mistake, wo answer. God’s proposition Is that all<sup>1 </sup>of th© world of mankind who do not; enter Into the trial of this present tim@' —th© judgment or trial of the Churchy the spirit-begotten ones—-will have aa opportunity of entering into the judgment or trial of the world for the prize<sup>1 </sup>©f Restitution and human perfection' ©n the earthly plane. This blessing, this privilege, will bertn with the living nations at the tir-e of the begin-Bing of the establishment of the Lord’s Kingdom, but it will not end with them. The Scriptures declare, “AH nations which thou hast made shall com® and worship before thee.” And again, “In thy Seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of those nations and families have perished from the earth, but th® Divine provision of redemption and Jtestitution is meant for a', eventually^’ TM Scriptures .assure u@. of an awak&gt;</span></p>

Thus the Scrip-tares assure us that the first class, th® Messed and holy ones, the saintly, will alone share in th® First Resurrection, and that these shall be priests unto Ged and reign with Christ a thousand year® (Revelation zx, S, 4).

<p><span class="font4">A STORM AT SEA</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4 i</sup> Master, amt ih&amp;u net that we perish, ? ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;.Mark 4:^8 <sub>e</sub></span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">la oui text w® hav® the despairing ®ry ®f th© apostles to th® Lord, in the midst of what must have been a remarkably sever® storm on the Sea of Galli®®. Som® of th® disciples, at least, were experienced fishermen, accustomed to th© sudden squalls for which that sea is noted. For such courageous' men as Peter, James and fthn to appeal to Jesus for superhuttan aid implies that the conditions w®r® critical. It seems rather astonishing indeed that our Lwd could have slept under such strenuous conditions, but he was extremely exhausted from speaking to large multitudes and the Journey was mad® in considerable measure to get away from the people, in order that h@ might have necessary rest But again, ft is possible that our Lord feigned sleep for the very purpose ©f permitting his disciples to reach th® point of extremity which led them to call for his aid; because man’s extremity is God’s opportunity. Th© Master arose and rebuked the wind, saying, “Peace, b® still.” And there was a great calm. Aad he said to th® disciples, Why are y© so fearful? Have y© not yet faith?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This expression constitutes on® of th© great lessons of the Master to his pupils, his disciples, and it has com® ringing down the centuries, speaking peace to his followers ever sine®. The message it brings is that he who is able to control the storms and th® sea' is likewise abl® to govern all the affairs of lif© in th® interests of those ■ who are his consecrated followers, his disciples. Whether w® have had so remarkable an escape from a storm at sea or not, I am sure that some of us have had the .Master’s supervision and intervention for our protection from th® storms of lif®. To som© of our hearts h® has spoken these same words, “Peace, be still. Have y® not yet faith?” And with th® message cam® a great calm, a great serenity, a great rest in th® Lord and his superabundant care. If for a time th© Master seemed unconscious of our condition and asleep to the danger® about us, ft was only seemingly so. His cars and his power were equally With us, and none could really harm our interests as' New Creatures. He whose eye sever slumbers nor sleeps, keeps watch over th© interests of those who are truly his; and he is pledged that all things shall work together for good to them; because they love him; because they have been called according to his purpose; because they are seeking to make that calling and election sure by loving, self sacrificing obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Province of Faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In our judgment the Lord was not specially condemning the apostles for fearing the storm and awakening him to quell it. Indeed, their action indicates that they had faith; that they believed that the Master had the power which could save them. The Lord would have them exercise a still broader faith than this. He would have them realize the Father’s care as he had taught them, saying, “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing, and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father? * ® ® Fear ye not, therefore; ye are of mor© value . than many sparrows” (Matthew x, 29-81). The lesson sought to be inculcated was this: “The Father has called you to be my disciples and colaborers. You with myself, therefor®, are specially under_pivlne guidance and su-people in the Second Death (Acts iii,23), How wonderful is the Divine arrangement I Blessed are our eyes, for they see and our ears that they hear and our hearts that they now respond!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">pertoitoto. And h@ who lias Begun th® good work in you, and who purpose® to use you as his mouthpieces in th® proclaiming of his message and grace, is able to care for all your interests, both temporal and spiritual. Do you suppose that, after calling you to the ministry of his grace, h® would permit you to perish ? To so fear, Implies that you do not realize your calling to have been of God, or do not realize the Divine power, or that you doubt Divin© wisdom and supervision-being of Insufflcient faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Shall we not similarly Judge our* selves, scrutinte© our own hearts, to* quire within, if in the midst of the! storms and tempests of life w® becom® terrified? Would not this imply thaf w® doubt the Divine providences in ©ur own cases in the past and that we are uncertain as respects our calling of th® Lord to be followers of th© Lamb, sharers to th® sufferings of Christ now and heirs of th® glory that ©hall follow? Or would it mean that w® lacked faith,' lacked confidenc® in God? Perhaps no other lesson is more important tor God’s children to learn; to the present time than this—to have absolute confidence in their Father’s Justice, Wisdom, Love and Power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">W® Walk by Faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Th® ApostI® remarks of th® Church of this ag®, <sup>4&lt;</sup>W® walk by faith and not by sight” In this respect th® Gos* pel Church is different from th® Jewish Church of th© preceding ag® am| different from th® Millennial Church th® oncomtog ag®. The latter will walk by sight Th® Sun of Righteous-Mas will shin® forth, w® ar© assured, and. scatter all th© darkness of ign©» rauc®, superstition and prejudie®, and good th® world with th® “light of th® knowledge of th© glory of God.” There will b® no more walking by th® Hght of th® lamp, to© Bibi®, so pml©w to us now, so necessary to us now as S lamp to our feet and as a light to footsteps to assist us in walking ta the “narrow way” by faith and not by sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Jewish church of th® preceding age was privileged to walk consider* ably by sight, not so clear and distinct a light as that which win illuminats the world to th© Mfllennium, but, nevertheless, they walked by sight, because th® Divine terms were that it they obeyed God’s Word and walked to his statutes ho would bless them to basket and stor® and flock and herd and in their families and to their hearts. Aad the assurance was that if there was any calamity it would b® because ©f their departure from th® Lord and would mark his disfavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But during this Gospel-Ag© how different! Whoever would b® God’s child, a follower ©f Jesus, in th© present time must walk by faith and not by sight H© must believe what h® can-' not se®. H@ must learn that the cost of discipleship in this age, th® cost of sonship in th® Divin® family in this present time means self-saerifiee, a narrow way, opposition and persecution. “Yea, whoever will live godly in this present world will suffesRpersecu-tion.” Instead of being blessed above other men in their temporal affairs the Consecrated^ the sanctified, have the Scriptural assurance that they 'm®t expect th® reverse. Instead of being kept to perfect health many of th® Lord's followers have had sad expert-' ences on beds of sickness and pain. Instead of being wealthy it was foretold that there would be not many rich amongst them, not many great, not many wise according to th® course of this world, but that the riches they must esteem are the riches of God’s grace associated with the exceeding great and precious promises of God’s Word. Instead of being surrounded by . conditions of affluence, wealth and eag® their circumstances are generally the reverse of these. And why is this so? Because the Lord is now choosing or selecting from amongst mankind a little flock of “peculiar people” who h® designs shall eventually be joint-heirs with hfe Son in the Heavenly K-sg-dom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">FA FeeuHar Paa pi®,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Th© Lord’s people are peculiar to their dress—not as respects their out-jStard clothing, but as respects theta fbb® of Christ’s Bighteousness—theirs by imputation, because of faith in th® blood of Christ, faith in his sacrifice for sins. They are peculiar also in that they have a “wedding garment” which they wear continually and which they seek to keep “unspotted from the world” and which they trust by and by will admit their entrance with theta Lord to the great Marriage Supper when they, as members of the Brid©* Elect, shall become the Queen of Gl®» ry, Joint-Heirs with the Bridegroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These are peculiar also in that they lov® Righteousness and hate iniquity? whereas th® majority of people lov® iniquity and are ready to indulge to it to th® extent that they would not b@ ©aught ©r seriously injured. These, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">m </span><span class="font4">th® contrary, love Righteousness because they have com® to esteem it a® th® character of their Heavenly Father and his will respecting them, an&lt; they have com© to hate iniquity be-cans® they have learned of its injuri® ©usnegs and that the Heavenly Father is not pleased with inequity, injustice^ wrong in any form. These peculiar people ar® s® desirous of pleasing th© Heavenly Father that they are quite willing to be thought peculiar or Strang® to the world to general that they may hear by and by the word^ “Well done, good and faithful servant^ thou hast been faithful over a few ^ings, I will make the® ruler ©vw many things” (Matthew xxv, 28).</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Many of the Lord’s followers already are crying to him in terror, “Master, rarest thou not that we per~ fob? Seest thou not how agnosticism®: ander a new name of Higher Criticism,' fe seeking to capsize us, to overwhelm' ®s, to break the cable of faith by which we are anchored to the sure' promises of thy Word!

<p><span class="font4">P«ac@, Be StiH! g@ 8tHU</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">T® all such appeals the Master’s re-fly is, “Have ye not yet faith?” Do ye not know that the Word that goeth froM my mouth shall prosper in the thing whereto it was sent?. Do you TOt realize that he who began th© work of selecting the Church will accomplish it? Do you not know that aaught could come to pass without #©ur Father’s knowledge and permission? Do you not remember the words ®f the Lord, “Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were give® thee from above,” except it were permitted thee ®f my Father (John six, M). Our difficulty has been to som® extent the same that our Lord men-tiosed to the Sadducees saying, “Ye fl® @rr, not knowing th® Scriptures, nor the power of God” (Matthew xxii, 28). _</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But what my the Scriptures on tW subject? We answer that they fore® tell the present condition of things an^ giv® us aa outlook future. They call' our attention to the fact that there is. a Domtaal Church, as well as th® real one, m outward class of considerable numbers which have a form of godll-®^s, but without the power, and a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">dock” which has th® Trsth and is m heart relationship with the Lora, begotten of the holy Spirit. They tell n.«s that w® have been mistaken In, the past in supposing that It Is a part of the Heavenly Father's plan to convert the world during this present Gospel Age; that that part of his plan belongs to the next age; that his present work Is the gathering of the “elect,” the “little flock,&quot; to be associated with the Redeemer as his Bride in the glorious Kingdom, for which We pray, “Thy Kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.” They assure us that the storm of Higher Criticism, infidelity and Evolution and general godlessness and faithlessness which we see coming, which is already upon us, will indeed be a terrible storm, the like of which was permitted to the time of trouble which closed th® Jewish Age, and again in the close of the eighteenth century to the French Revolution. The Scriptures show us that th© Lord intends to make a separation between merely nominal Christians and the saints—the pure in heart, the full of faith, the full of zeal, th® lovers of Righteousness, the haters of Iniquity. And his testing and sifting' ®f the true wheat and its separation from the tares will be a thorough and complete work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It t§ Mt sufficient that we go back a few centuries for the true light on God’s Word* We must go clear back to the words of Jemts and the Apostles and the Prophets. Their teachings were quickly lost in the great falling away foretold, and only of late have we the Bible-Study Helps necessary to our full enlightenment. These are God’s gifts at the opening of the New Epoch called the Millennium. The electric light and other wonderful blessings of our day are from the same Giver of all good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We oommend to the thousands of our readers the careful study of the Six Series of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Studies in the Scriptures''</span><span class="font5"> Many of you must already have them in your horn s, for over three millions of the first series is announced by th® publishers^ The Biblis and Tract Society of Brooklyn Tabernacle, Brooklyn, N.Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We urge that you read these Studies, yea that you study them, if you would have the greatest blessing imaginable by a Christian in the present life. Never mind the fact that some dear Christian people speak evil of this work as many spoke evil of our Master and his words. They are prejudiced, blinded, like Saul of Tarsus of old. In ignorance they oppose, not having read. Hearken to the words of C. T. Smith of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Atlanta Constitution,</span><span class="font5"> which we heartily endorse:-—</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>w</sup> This wonderful book makes no assertions that are not well sustained by the Scriptures. It is built up stone by stone, and upon every stone is the text, and it becomes a pyramid of God’s love and mercy and wisdom. There is nothing in the Bible that the author denies or doubts, but there are many texts that h© throws a flood of light upon that seem to uncover its meaning.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>w</sup> It is impossible to read this book without loving the writer and pondering his wonderful solution of the great mysteries that have troubled us all our lives. There is hardly a family to be found that has not lost some loved one who died outside the church—outside the plan of salvation, and, if Calvinism be true, outside of all hope and inside of eternal torment and despair.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font4">first president </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the Baptist Alliance was the late Rev. Dr. Alex</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ander </span><span class="font4">McLaren, of Manchester, England, and the second one the Rev. Dr. John Clifford, of London. The Rev. Dr. MacArthur is the third, and the first American.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dr. MacArthur, with characteristic ▼Igor and decision, is planning for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a trip </span><span class="font4">to St. Petersburg and to Rome </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">the interest of the church which has honored him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font4">matter that will take President MacArthur to Rome is liberty of Bap</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tists </span><span class="font4">in Spain and Portugal and of Protestant Christians in Peru and Ecua</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">dor. </span><span class="font4">Baptists went into Portugal almost before former King Manuel of that country reached his exile in England. It is denied by Baptist leaders in Europe that they have any contention with the Catholic church. They say their only purpose In Portugal is to assist in the spread of the Gospel and to succeed in spreading it where, as they say, the Catholic church </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font4">failed. The American Bible Society </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font4">recently reported the burning </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Bibles and tracts in the streets of Peru cities. It IS not charged that Catholics did wrong, but that mobs, incident to almost all countries, were carried away </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">by evil reports.—Exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Incidentally we might remark to Brother MacArthur and the American Bible Society that there Is a little home missionary work needing to be done in opposition to Bible and tract burnings right here in our glorious America, the land of the free and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">home </span><span class="font4">of the brave. Twenty-seven copies of “Studies in the Scriptures” were recently burned in the public streets. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">auto de fee </span><span class="font4">equalled the Spanish procedure and excelled it in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4">it had Protestant clerical supervision and endorsement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This interesting exhibition </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the medieval spirit was manifested in an American City in Arkansas. An evangelist of probably more zeal than knowledge preached powerfully of what </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font4">did not know about God’s intention </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">eternally roast, stew and fry every member of our race except a saintly handful of the “very elect.” Many of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font4">auditors had been as ignorant of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">true teachings of the Bible as himself, but had begun to have the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">eyes of </span><span class="font4">their understanding open to the true meaning of God’s Word respecting the eternal rewards and punishments of humanity. These saner thoughts they had been gleaning from the study of a book entitled “Millennial Dawn.” Evidently the evangelist </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font4">been perplexed by some of the questions put to him by those who </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font4">been reading the books; so he persuaded his hearers that the entire Bum of the Gospel, all of the “good tidings of great joy,” centers in the doctrine of eterndl torment and that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">any </span><span class="font4">other thought of happiness than that of looking over the battlements </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">heaven and seeing their friends in agony in hell would be blasphemy. Then </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font4">persuaded the poor souls whom he had misguided under the title of “evangelist” to bring their books, after the manner of olden times, and make </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">bonfire of them in the street. TWenty -seven copies of “Millennial Dawn” books were brought and, after prayer </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">God, they rendered a hymn of praise for tile darkness and superstition which they enjoyed, and then set fire to the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But “all things work together for good t® those who love God—to the called according to His purpose”—the really elect. While this exhibition of the twentieth eentury intelligence was progressftng, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font4">officer of the church, whose *‘®yes of understanding” the devil had not completely closed, passed that way.—2 Cor. 4: 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A MINISTER TURNS JUDGE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">In reading the below item we perceive that a minister has forgotten the Master’s injunction, “Judge nothing before the time.” Even though the word damn be given its proper signification of condemn, the minister in question has made of himself a judge and a condemner without authority. But the entire statement implies that the minister in question believes that the word damn means more than condemn—that it signifies in some unexplainable way a consignment to eternal torture. Notwithstanding this, he as a professed servant and representative of God, damns to eternal torment some who do not square their conduct with his sentiment. Then he declares that he hopes the damned ones will repent in time so they may not receive the penalty which he has pronounced against them. Here is the belated statement, widely published in the secular press:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I have been taught that ‘damn’ 18 a good Scriptural word; not, however, to be used unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently, discreetly and advisedly, soberly and in the fear of God, like matrimony or a blue pill; and so I say advisedly and soberly: Damn the Ice Trust and the Milk Trust and the farmers and the cows and everybody and everything that is making this hot weather an excuse for boosting the price of ice and milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I hope they’ll repent in time to escape that place where they’d give their moral souls for a drink of iced milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yours truly,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">L. S. OSBORNE,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Rector </span><span class="font4">Trlpity Episcopal </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Church, Newark, N. J.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We doubt very much if Rev. Osborne </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font4">any other educated minister of today really believes in a place of eternal torture; for they all know that the Hebrew word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sheol </span><span class="font4">in the Old Testament and the Greek word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">hades </span><span class="font4">in the New Testament signify the death state and never a place of fire, suffering or torture. They know that the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Gehenna of </span><span class="font4">the New Testament, rendered hell-fire, is explained in the Bible itself as signifying the Second Death. They know that the story of the rich man, Dives, and the poor man, Lazarus, is a parable with the most inspiring and happifylng interpretation consistent with itself and with the entire Bible. Why, then, should Brother Osborne or any other minister of Christ, even in a joke, use language calculated to be misunderstood by nine-tenths of his readers? We can only say that, in our judgment, it is a grievous mistake which Brother Osborne and all other ministers should seek to profit by.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font4">*THE QUESTION of the Ages is, Why 1 did the Almighty, originally, permit Evil—Sin? And why has an Omnipotent Ruler such as He, for more than sixty centuries, permitted Satan to continue his reign of sin and death? Leaving out entirely the unscriptural theory so prevalent, respecting a purgatory o&lt; centuries, or a torment everlasting, and considering merely the trials, suffering, sorrow and pain of humanity during the present life, how shall we account for their permission by an All-Powerful Creator, who knew the end from the beginning?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why does He permit injustice, unrighteousness, headaches, heartaches, etc.? Why does He not deal with humanity graciously, kindly, lovingly, as a Father—as He deals with the angelic sons of God? Is it just or loving on the part of our Creator to bring forth millions of His creatures under these admittedly unfavorable conditions—■ beset by weaknesses and sinwardness from their birth and surrounded by others, similarly weak, and beset by Satan and his minions—wicked spirits? Is it just that we should thus be in an unequal fight subjected to weaknesses and dying and imperfect conditions on account, of the sin of our first parents and then, on the same account, be in danger of an eternity of torture, with nine hundred and ninety-nine chances out of a thousand against us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• Our question is sure’.y too deep for any human philosophy, and those who reject the Bible as of Divine inspiration may as well abandon all hope of an answer. God Himself, and none other, could tell us of His own secrets —why He did as He did. Truly we read, -“The secret of the Lord is with them that reverence Him; and He will show them His Covenant.”—Psalm 25:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The light now shining upon the Word of God shows us that the Divine purpose in connection with mankind is a progressive one, embracing Ages and Dispensations. If we ignore these, we are thereby blinded to the true answer to our question. Accepting these, it is the privilege of Bible students today to see the light in God's Word—to see matters from the Divine standpoint, to understand the “Mystery of God, hidden from Ages and from generations, and now made known unto His saints,” namely, that in the Ages to come all the trials and difficulties, all the sorrows and tears of the past, will be more than compensated for, and proved to be a part of the great Divine Program which will work out to the glory of God and the enlightenment and blessing of angels and men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Man’s Primary Lesson</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">First of all, God chooses to have children possessed of a quality like His own—freedom of will. He therefore not only created man perfect in mind and body, but He gave to him a will, the power of choice—liberty to choose one course or another. God foresaw that giving man this liberty of will would lead to the seduction of Mother Eve, and to the disobedience of Father Adam, through his love for his wife. Adam’s preference was to die with her rather than to live in harmony with God without her; for if he should disobey he would come under the sentence of death. Although Adam and the angels were perfect, they had not a perfect knowledge of their Creator, of His Love, His Wisdom, His Justice, His Power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God, therefore, without interfering with Adam’s liberty, permitted the great calamity of death to come upon him and his race. From the very beginning God premeditated the entire Plan of Salvation, as He has since been working it out; and He'will completely accomplish the same ultimately through Messiah’s Kingdom. The great lesson which will eventually </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">coffle </span><span class="font4">both to angels and men will show forth Divine Wisdom, Justice, Love and Power, fully co-ordinated^ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font4">no other way that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">we can </span><span class="font4">imagine </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">could this great Revelation of the Di</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">vine character be so well made. However, in order to comprehend thia* great Program, it is necessary that we follow strictly the Scriptural teachings, and avoid wholly the nonsense </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">our creeds, manufactured during th® Dark Ages. We must see that “th® wages of sin” is not eternal torment, nor purgatory, but </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God allowed this reign of sin and death from Adam until Moses without so much as making an offer of terms of reconciliation and peace. Then an offer was made to the nation of Israel, and to no other nation. Th® offer of Israel’s Law Covenant was, “He that doeth thes® things shall live.” God, of course, knew that Israel could not keep perfectly the conditions of that great and wonderful Law. The offer served as a lesson to that nation respecting the impossibility of any man’s keeping the perfect Law; and the same lesson comes to us of this Gospel Dispensation. We se® that what the Jew could not do we cannot do; where he failed we would fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus through the Law Covenant God taught a great lesson to Israel and to the Church; and He will ultimately teach the same lesson to the world and to angels—proving that by the deeds* of the Law no fallen flesh could be recovered and re-instated in Divine favor. Four thousand years passed from man’s creation, and death reigned from Moses to Christ as thoroughly as it had previously reigned from Adam to Moses. The Law Covenant did not stop the reign of sin and death. Something more than a&gt; Law is necessary. The Divine Program demands recovery from sin </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">death, and the Divine Program purposes this recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nearly nineteen centuries have </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">pas</span><span class="font4">sed since the first advent of our </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord, </span><span class="font4">and still the reign of sin and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">death </span><span class="font4">is in progress more than ever. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Th® </span><span class="font4">increase of knowledge has brought </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font4">crease of sin; increase of population has brought increase of death; </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">until </span><span class="font4">today the world is in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">terrible </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">con</span><span class="font4">dition of mental, moral and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">physical </span><span class="font4">dilapidation, and ninety thousand </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">go </span><span class="font4">into the tomb every twenty-four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But a Remedy is in sight. It </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font4">foretold through the Prophets, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">but ft. </span><span class="font4">began to operate in Jesus. His miraculous birth, His faithfulness and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">con</span><span class="font4">secration unto death, His reward </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">resurrection and exaltation to th® right hand of the Majesty on High, are all essential to man’s recovery-essential to the overthrow of this reign of sin and death over our race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We see still further developments and preparations. The Scriptures </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font4">form us that it is the Divine purposa to have a multitudinous Messiah, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">which the glorious Jesus is the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Head </span><span class="font4">and the Church the Body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We perceive that God for nearly nineteen centuries has been calling-and drawing a special class 01 mankind to constitute His Elect, the Brid® Class, to be joint-heirs with His Son in the Kingdom of Glory which will finally vanquish sin and Satan and deliver the willing and obedient of man— kind into the full liberty of the children of God—freedom from sin and death, and into the enjoyment of lif® everlasting and Divine favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Dark and Narrow Path</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This special class is required </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">t® </span><span class="font4">walk by faith and not by sight—to walk in the “narrow way” of selfdenial and opposition to the worlds the flesh and the Adversary, in th® footsteps of Jesus. Ignorance, selfishness, sin, death, all go to make up th® deplorable- conditions in the world and to constitute the way. a narrow on® in which this Elect class is required to walk, in order to demonstrate their full loyalty and obedience to the will of God—even unto death. Evidently, no such narrow way could have existed had God not permitted evil—sin. Evidently, therefore, this Elect class jsould not be developed and tested except by the Divine permission of sin, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(Continued on 2d page, 2d column.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Union Theological Seminary, endow</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font4">as a Presbyterian institution, years ago became infidel as respects the Bible. Avoiding the name infidelity, it Uses instead “Higher Criticism.” Its Board of Directors sympathize with the Professors in their teaching of unbelief—in their attempt to undermine and discredit the Word of God. The majority of all the Presbyterian ministers educated within the last ’twenty years sympathize with the Professors and the Board of Directors of the Seminary. There are, however, some Presbyterian ministers and others who still hold faithfully to the Bible as the Word of God, notwithstanding the finger of scorn is pointing at them as &quot;old fogies.” Some of these hold their position from principle; others, apparently according to their own expressions, oppose the Seminary and Higher Criticism because they believe that the majority of their congregation, “common people, are not yet ready to throw away the Bible.” Anyway there is a sufficient number, who, for one reason or another, still stand by the Bible to occasionally make themselves heard. This is evidenced by the following clipping from a secular newspaper:—■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Students of the Union Theological Seminary were not much worried over the news from Pittsburg that the National Executive Commission of the Presbytery would recommend that-they be barred from ministerial positions on account of unorthodox views voiced by their professors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Even if the recommendation is adopted,” said President Francis Brown </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Of </span><span class="font4">the seminary, “our boys will not </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">barred from the ministry. The present graduating class </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">will doubtless enter other churches, </span><span class="font4">if the Presbytery bars them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Higher Criticism form of infidelity has been now advanced so far with Presbyterians and others that the Union Seminary can snap its fingers in the face of opposers and say, What care we ■ for you?—“there are others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is also true that only a small minority in any denomination of Protestantism still stands for the Bible as the inspired Word of God—the only Divine Revelation given to men. Alas!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reason for this “falling away from the faith,” which the Apostle foretold centuries ago, is clear. It </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Is </span><span class="font4">because of the grievous errors of our creeds made in the dark ages, which we can no longer swallow, nor, keep down when already swallowed. These creeds have been mistaken' for true interpretations of God’s Word, and, in rejecting them, the Bible is generally’ rejected also, under the supposition </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4">the monstrous theories of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">creeds are clearly taught in the Bible. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Oh! </span><span class="font4">that Christians would wake to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a fresh </span><span class="font4">study of the Bible in its own light. Oh, that we all might take off </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">colored glasses of our forefathers </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">study ourselves into heart and’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">faith union </span><span class="font4">as the children </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Cont-inued from 1st page.) </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font4">very essence of their </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">character</span><span class="font4">development is associated with the Divine promise that “all things shall work together for good to those who love God, to the called ones according to His purpose.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seemed wise to our Heavenly Father that our Lord Jesus should learn obedience through sufferings and be tested in respect to His willingness to endure suffering for righteousness’ sake. How appropriate it is that the same Father should make similar arrangements for all of the Church, whom He will receive from amongst the race of Adam to be members of . the Royal Priesthood under Jesus, the High Priest of our order!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We see a necessity for this, not only as respects our own testings and a thorough proof of our own heart-loyal-tnw the Lord/i-but additionally we see a wisdom, on Goti’s part in thus preparing a priesthood of the, future. A priest, as recognized amongst the Jews, was not merely one who offered sacrifices, although every priest was of necessity a sacrificer. The special mission of the priestly tribe amongst the other tribes -was that of instructing, helping, healing, teaching. And so God is preparing a Royal Priesthood for the Messianic Age to bless, to heal, to teach, to uplift all the willing and obedient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The royalty of the Priesthood signifies that it will no longer be a sacrificing class, for all sacrificing, will be at an end. It will be a gloritms class, royal, of the divine nature, and representatives with our Lord Jesus of the Divine power. As Priests who will have to do with judging and chastening, healing and helping humanity, how much sympathy do we suppose that these Royal Priests should have? Are they not to be on the Divine plane of glory, “members of the Body” of Messiah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Sin’s Lesson to Humanity</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Humanity is learning, a great lesson through the permission of sin. Present experiences teach the lesson that “the way of the transgressor is hard”; “The wages of sin is death”; “The soul that sinneth it shall die.” The exceeding sinfulness of sin is thus being demonstrated to humanity. Few profit by the lesson in the present life, and these are chiefly such as are called to the heavenly calling. The great majority of mankind learn to know sin, evil, only. Even God’s provision for the future of mankind is obscured from the masses. “The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light Of the glorious ' Gospel of God’s goodness' should shine into their hearts.”—2 Cor. 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But with the dawning of the New Dispensation of Messiah’s Kingdom, the true light of the knowledge of the glory of God’s character will shine everywhere. “All the blind eyes shall be opened and all the deaf ears shall be unstopped.” Messiah’s gracious reign,' the manifestation of Divine mercy, will be for the very purpose of uplifting these poor, fallen members of our race—-the masses. During the thousand years of Messiah’s Kingdom, the whole world will have full opportunity for learning the great desirability of righteousness, as now, for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">few years, they have the opportunity of learning the undesirability of sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the close of the Mediatorial reign what wonderful lessons respecting good and evil mankind will have learned! Then will come their final testing. After full knowledge of both good and evil, Which will they choose? God urges all to choose the right and its reward of life eternal. Nevertheless, He will not coerce; He will allow each</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font4">HE Scriptural records refer to the Church of Christ as one, not as many. In this matter the Church of Rome and the Church of England hold aloof from many Protestant denominations. They claipi that to recognize, them as churches would be unscript-ural, since there is but .one Church of the Living God. The various Protestant denominations started out with similar views, similar theories, though today they have abandoned them. The Church of England formed an organization separate from that of Rome, believing that the former had been the one true Church but had departed from the faith, and that it was the duty of the faithful to recognize her as Babylon—confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The'claim to be the true Church they applied to themselves. Similarly, Presbyterians, Methodists, Congregationalists, Adventists, Disciples, etc., have withdrawn, and many of these originally claimed to be the one true, loyal, faithful Church of Christ. Today, however, the pendulum has swung to the other side. Moreover, the narrowness of the past is rapidly giving way. All are learning that to be a Christian means more than merely to be immersed; more than merely to be sprinkled; more than merely to believe in the doctrine of Election; more than merely to believe in the doctrine of Free Grace; more than to -believe in the doctrine of Transubstantiation or Consubstantiation. With this enlargement of mind Christians are indeed in danger of losing sight of the fact that, the True Church is the custodian of “the faith once delivered to the saints’’ —which acknowledges “one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of all, and one Church of the living God.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Some time after their deliverance from Egypt, by Divine direction, the first-borns of all the families and tribes of Israel were exchanged, person by person, for the one tribe of Levi. The Levites thereafter represented the First-born of the Church—they alone •represented the first-borns of Israel passed over in that night.

As the latter was introduced by the shaking of Sinai, in a general time of darkness, thus, the Apostle intimates, the New Covenant is about to be inaugurated, in the end of this Age, by a time of most awful trouble, of which that at Sinai was merely a symbolic picture or type. God’s voice then shook the earth, but in the antitype He will shake everything that can be shaken.

<p><span class="font4">basis of the former. We must not share this mistake. While doing all in our power to —remove all the creed fences which divide God’s people into sects and parties, let us hold fast to the Bible, the most wonderful Book in the world. It is only beginning to be understood; its true light is shining today as never before. We are in the time mentioned by the Prophet, when the “wise shall understand.”—Dan. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">12j </span><span class="font4">10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Calvin was right in part— to the extent that he was in harmony with the Bible, which teaches us to strive to fulfil our Covenant with the Lord, that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">thus </span><span class="font4">we may “make our calling and election sure.” It does not teach the predestination which Calvin taught and which Wesley objected to —the predestination of the non-elect to an eternity of torture. The only predestination mentioned in the Bible is connected with the Church, the saints. God predestinated that none could be of the Church class, the Bride class, except such as would become copies of His Son, the Redeemer. That predestination stands unalterable, but it has no effect upon others than the elect. It merely says that none except the saintly shall participate in the election. It says not one word about the fate of the non-elect. Read Romans 8: 28-30 and you will see this for yourself. To this, the Scriptural predestination, none can object. It is the unscriptural deductions which have caused us difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Wesley was in exact accord with the Bible in his declaration that every member of our race must have a share in the grace of God in Christ. However, what Brother Wesley did not see was that the great Plan of the Ages is not confined to one century nor to one Age. He did not see that, while this Gospel Age is exclusively devoted to the selection of the Church class, invited to be “the Bride, the Lamb’s Wife,” there is a coming Age in which Christ and His glorified Bride will extend Divine mercy to the non-elect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Key to the Mystery</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Is expressed in the Apostle’s words, “in due time.” Our great Creator need not be in haste. He has all eternity before Him.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Brother Wesley’s Proof Text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Wesley’s loving heart found and tightly grasped the declaration;, &quot;And the Spirit and the Bride say. Come; and let him that heareth say, Come; and let him that is athirst come; and whosoever will, let him take </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">water of life freely.” (Rev. 22: 17.) This tejrt, however, belongs to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">coming Age, to the time when Messiah shall reign: “For He must reign until He hath put all enemies under His feet.” (1 Cor. 15: 25-29.) There is no Bride yet to say, “Come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are glad of this, glad that it IS still possible for us to become members of that Bride class which must -“make herself ready” for the marriage and be forever united to the Lord </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font4">His Bride at His second coming. Then by the marriage she will become the Redeemer’s joint-heir to glory, honor and immortality in the Kingdom, Then she, in co-operation with the Spirit of the Lord, will say, “Come,” to whosoever wills to come of Adam’s race. Everyone will say, “Come”; there will be a world-wide invitation. All the blind eyes shall be opened </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">see the waters of life; all the deaf </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ears </span><span class="font4">shall be unstopped to hear of the gracious favor of God’s love in Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But as there is no Bride yet to say, “Come,” neither is there any &quot;river </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the water of life” yet to invite them to. There will be no such river until! after the establishment of the Kingdom for which the Master taught </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">us</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Before so-called Christendom lies the open </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">history of </span><span class="font4">all past time, as well as the di</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">vinely </span><span class="font4">inspired revelation. And what les</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sons </span><span class="font4">they contain! lessons of experience, of wisdom, of knowledge, of grace, and of warn</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ing. </span><span class="font4">By giving heed to the experiences of preceding generations along the various lines </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">human industry, political economy, etc., </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Hie </span><span class="font4">world has made very commendable progress in material things. Many of the comforts and conveniences of our present civilization have come to us largely from applying the lessons observed in the expe</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">riences </span><span class="font4">of past generations. The art of printing has brought theBe lessons within </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">range of every man. The present generation in this one point alone has much advantage every way: all the accumulated </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">wisdom </span><span class="font4">and experience of the past are added </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">its own. But the great moral lessons which men ought also to have been studying </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">learning have been very generally disre</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">garded, </span><span class="font4">even when they have been emphat</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ically </span><span class="font4">forced upon public attention. History </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4">full of such lessons to thoughtful minds inclined to righteousness; and men of the present day have more such lessons than those of any previous generation?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Christendom Warned.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The ecclesiastical powers of Christendom have also had line upon line and precept upon precept. They have been warned by tiie providential dealings of God with His people in the past and by occasional reformers. Yet few, very few, can read the handwriting on the wall and they are power</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">less to </span><span class="font4">overcome, or even to stay, the pop</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ular </span><span class="font4">current. Rev. T. DeWitt Talmage seemed to see and understand to some extent; </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for, </span><span class="font4">in a timely discourse, he said:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Unless the Church of Jesus Christ rises </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">up </span><span class="font4">and proves herself the friend of the people </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font4">the friend of God, and in sympathy with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">great masses, who with their families </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font4">their backs are fighting this battle for bread, the church, as at present organized, ^will become a defunct institution, and Christ will go down again* to the beach and invite plain, honest fishermen to come into an apostleship of righteousness—manward and Godward. The time has come when all classes of people shall have equal rights in th® </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font4">struggle to get a livelihood.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And yet this man, with a stewardship of talent and influence which but few possess, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">did </span><span class="font4">not seem in haste to follow his expressed convictions as to the duties of influential Christians in the hour of peril.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The warnings go forth, and convictions of duty and privilege fasten upon many minds; but alas! all is'of no avail; they go unheeded. Great power has been, and to some extent . still is, in the hands of ecclesiastics; _ but, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">the name of Christ and His Gospel, it has been, and still is, selfishly used and abused. “Honor one of another,” “chief seats in the synagogues,” and &quot;to be called Rabbi,” Doctor, Reverend, etc., and seeking gain, each “from his own quarter or denomination” (John 5:44; Matt. 23: 6-12; Isa. 56:11), and “the fear of man which bringeth a snare”—these hinder some even of God’s true servants from faithfulness, while apparently many of the under-shepherds never had any interest in the Lord’s flock except to secure the golden fleece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While we gladly acknowledge that many educated, cultivated, refined and pious gentlemen are, and have been, included among the clergy in all the various denominations of the nominal Church, which all through the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Age </span><span class="font4">has included both wheat and tares (Matt. 13:30), we are forced to admit that many who belong to the “tare ” class have found their way into the pulpits as well as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">into </span><span class="font4">the pews. Indeed the temptations to pride and vainglory, and in many cases to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ease </span><span class="font4">and affluence, presented to talented young men aspiring to the pulpit have been such as to guarantee that it must be so, and that to a large extent. Of all the professions, the Christian ministry has afforded the quickest and easiest route to fame, ease and general temporal prosperity, and often to wealth. The profession of law requires a lifetime of intellectual energy and business effort, and brings its weight of pressing care. The -same may be said of the profession of medicine. And if men rise to wealth and distinction in these professions, it is not merely because they have quick wits and ready tongues, but because they have honestly won distinction by close and constant mental</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">application and laborious effort. On the other hand, in the clerical profession, a refined, pleasant demeanor, moderate ability</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">

<p><span class="font4">to address a public assembly twice a week on some theme taken from the Bible, to-gather with a moderate education and good <sub>t</sub>J '<sub>the</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-s^kffi^^eTavTno</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">fear that their candid presentation will give offense to any mf the meek, who, if they recognize the truth, will be blessed by a humble confession of the same and a full determination to walk in the light of God as it shines from His Word, regardless of human traditions. x We rejoice to say that thus far during the Harvest period we have come to know a few clergymen of this class, who, when the Harvest Truth dawned upon them, forsook the error and pursued and served the truth. But the majority of the clergy, alas! are not of the meek class, and again we are obliged to realize the force of the Master’s words, “How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!” whether those riches be of reputation, fame, learning,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">moral character, secure to any young man entering the profession’ the respect and reverence of his community, a comfortable salary and a quiet, undisturbed and easy life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If he have superior talent, the people, who are admirers of oratory, soon discover it, and before long he is called to a more lucrative charge; and, almost before he knows it, he has become famous among men, who rarely</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">stop to question whether his piety—his faith, humility and godliness—have kept pace in development with his intellectual and oratorical progress. In fact, if the latter be the case, he is less acceptable, especially to wealthy congregations, which, probably more frequently than very poor ones, are composed mostly of “tares.” If his piety indeed survive the pressure of these circumstances, he will, too often for the good of his reputation, be obliged to run counter to the dispositions and prejudices of his hearers, and he will shortly find himself unpopular and undesired. These circumstances have thus brought into the pulpit a very large proportion of what the Scriptures designate “hireling shepherds.”—Isa. 56:11; Ezek. 34:2-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Responsibility of Ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The responsibility of those who have undertaken the gospel ministry in the name of Christ is very great. They stand very prominently before the people as the representatives of Christ, as special exponents of His Spirit, and expounders of His Truth. And as a class, they have had advantages above other men for coming to a knowledge of the truth, and freely declaring it. They have been relieved from the burdens of toil and care in earning a livelihood which fetter other men, and, with their temporal wants supplied, have been granted time, quiet leisure, special education and numerous helps of association, etc., for this very purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here, on the one hand, have been these great opportunities for pious zeal and devoted self-sacrifice for the cause of truth and righteousness; and, on the other, great temptations, either to indolent ease or to ambition for fame, wealth or power. Alas! the vast majority of the clergy have evidently succumbed to the temptations, rather than embraced and used the opportunities, of their positions; and, as a result, they are today &quot;blind leaders of the blind,” and together they and their flocks are fast stumbling into the ditch of skepticism. They have hidden the truth (because it is unpopular), advanced error (because it is popular), and taught for doctrine the precepts of men (because paid to do so). They have, in effect, and sometimes in so many words, said to the people, “Believe what we tell you on our authority,’ ’ instead of directing them to “prove all things” by the divinely inspired words of the apostles and prophets, and “hold fast” only “that which is good.” For long centuries the clergy of the Church of Rome kept the Word of God buried in dead languages, and would not permit its translation into the vernacular tongues, lest the people might search the Scriptures and thus prove the vanity of her pretensions. In the course of time a few godly reformers arose from the midst of her corruption, rescued the Bible from oblivion and brought it forth to the people; and a great Protestant movement, protesting against the false doctrines and evil practises of the Church of Rome, was the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But ere long Protestantism also became corrupt, and her clergy began to formulate creeds to which they have taught the people to look as the epitomized doctrines of the <sup>: </sup>Bible, and of paramount importance. They ■ have baptized and catechised them in in- ’ fancy, before they had learned to think; then, as they grew to adult years, they have ' lulled them to sleep, and given them to un- ; derstand that their safe course in religious matters is to commit all questions of doc- । trine to them, and to follow their instruc- i tions, intimating that they alone had the ’ education, etc., necessary to the compre- <sup>1 </sup>hension of divine truth, and that they, 1</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4">God’s Word. And when any presumed to question this assumed authority and to think differently they were regarded as heretics and schismatics. The most learned and prominent among them have written massive volumes of what they term Systematic Theology, all of which, like the Talmud among the Jews, is calculated to a large extent to make void the Word of God, and to teach for doctrine the precepts of men (Matt. 15:6; Isa. 29:13); and others of the learned and prominent have accepted honorable and lucrative professorships in Theological Seminaries, established, ostensibly, to train young men for the Christian ministry, but in fact to inculcate the ideas of the so-called “Systematic Theology” of thei-i several schools—to fetter free thought and</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">&quot;clergy” has pressed along the beaten track of traditional error. And only occasionally has one been sufficiently awake and loyal to the truth to discover error and cry out for reform. It has been so much easier to drift with the popular current, especially when great men lea the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the power and superior advantages of the clergy as a class have been misused, although in their ranks there have been (and still are) some earnest, devout souls who yerily thought they were doing God service in upholding the false systems into which they had been led, and by whose errors they also had been in a great measure blinded.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">money, ot even common ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The common people need not be surprised, therefore, that the clergy of Christendom, as a class, are blind to the truths now due, just as the recognized teachers and leaders in the end of the typical Jewish Age were blind and opposed to the truths due in that Harvest. Their blindness is indeed a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">recompense</span><span class="font4"> for their misused talents and .opportunities, and therefore light and Truth cannot be expected from that quarter. In the end of the Jewish Age the religious leaders significantly suggested to the people the inquiry, “Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on Him? ” (John 7:48), and in accepting their suggestion and blindly submitting to their leading, some missed their privilege, and failed to enter into the blessings of the New Dispensation. So it is with a similar class in these last days of the Gospel Dispensation: those who blindly follow the leading of the clergy will fall with them into the ditch of skepticism; and only those who faithfully walk with God, partaking of His spirit, and humbly relying upon all the testimonies of His precious Word, shall be able to discern and discard the “stubble” of error which has long been mixed with the truth, and boldly to stand fast in the faith of the gospel and in loyalty of heart to God, while the masses drift off in , the popular current toward infidelity in its various forms; Evolution, Higher Criticism, Theosophy, Christian Science, Spiritism, or other theories denying tKe necessity and merit of the great Calvary Sacrifice. But those who successfully stand in this “evil day” (Eph. 6:13) will, in so doing, prove the metal of their Christian character; for so strong will be the current against them that only true Christian devotion to God, zeal, courage and fortitude will be able to endure to the end. These oncoming waves of infidelity will surely carry all others before them. It is written, “A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee, because thou hast said, The Lord is my protection, and the Most High hast thou made thy refuge . . . He that dwelleth in the secret place [of consecration, communion and fellowship] of the Most High shall abide under the shadowTjf the Almighty. . . . He shall cover thee with His feathers, and under His wings shalt thou trust: His Truth shall be thy shield and buckler.”—Psa. 91.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Duty of Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is our duty as Christians individually to prove all things we accept, and to hold fast that which is good. “To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them.”—Acts 17:11; IThess. 5:21; Isa. 8:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great nominal church has long taught for doctrines the precepts of men; and, ignoring in great measure the Word of God as the only rule of faith and godly living, it has boldly announced many conflicting and God-dishonoring doctrines, and has been unfaithful to the measure of truth retained. It has failed to cultivate and manifest the spirit of Christ, and has freely imbibed the spirit of the world. It has let down the bars of the sheepfold and called in the goats, and has even encouraged the wolves to enter and do their wicked work. It has been</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">To build up and perpetuate these </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">erroneous </span><span class="font4">doctrinal systems of what they are pleased to call “ Systematic Theology,” time and talent have been freely given. Their learned men have written massive volumes for other men to study instead of the Word of God; </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font4">this purpose theological seminaries </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font4">been established and generously endowed; and from these young men, instructed in their errors, have gone out to teach and to confirm the people in them. And th® people,.taught to regard these men as God’® appointed ministers, successors of the apo»-tles, have accepted their dictum without searching the Scriptures as did the noble come, the Day of reckoning is here, and great is the confusion and perplexity of the whole nominal church of every denomination; and particularly of the clergy, upon whom devolves the responsibility of conducting the defense in this Day of Judgment in the presence of many accusers and witnesses, and, if possible, of devising some remedy to save from complete destruction what they regard as the true Church. Yet inStheir present confusion, and in the desire of all the sects from reasons of policy to fellowship one another, they have each almost ceased to regard their own particular sect as the only tru® Church, and now speak of each other as various “branches” of the one Church,notwithstanding their contradictory creeds, which of necessity cannot all be true.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>“Ism,” Without the Protest.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">In this critical hour it is, alas! a lamentable fact that the wholesome spirit of “The Great Reformation” is dead. Protestantism is no longer a protest against the spirit of antichrist, nor against the world, the flesh or the Devil. Its creeds, at war with the Word of God, with reason, and with each other, and inconsistent with themselves, they seek to hide from public scrutiny. Its massive theological works are but fuel for the fire of this day of Christendom’s judgment. Its chief theological seminaries are hotbeds of infidelity, spreading the contagion everywhere. Its great men—its Bishops, Doctors of Divinity, Theological Professors, and its most prominent and influential clergymen in the large cities—are becoming the leaders into disguised infidelity. They seek to undermine and destroy the authority and inspiration of the sacred Scriptures, to supplant the plan of salvation therein revealed with the human theory of evolution. They seek a closer affiliation with, and imitation of, the Church of Rome, court her favor, praise her methods, conceal her crimes, and in so doing become confederate with her in spirit. They are also in close and increasing conformity to the spirit of the world in everything, imitating the vain pomp and glory of the world which they claim to have renounced. Mark the extravagant display in church architecture, decorations and furnishments, the heavy indebtedness thereby incurred,, and the constant begging and scheming for money thus necessitated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Note, too, the arrangements in connection with some churches of billiard rooms; and some ministers have even gone so far as to recommend the introduction of light wines; and private theatricals and plays are freely indulged in in some localities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In much of this the masses of church members have become the willing tools of the clergy; and the clergy in turn have freely pandered to the tastes and preferences of worldly and influential members. The people have surrendered their right and duty of private judgment, and have ceased to search the Scriptures to prSve what is truth, and to meditate upon God’s law to discern what is. righteousness. They are indifferent, worldly, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God; they are blinded by the god of this world and willing to be led into any schemes which minister to worldly desires and ambitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We would not be understood as including all Christians as “Babylonians.” Quite to the contrary. As the Lord recognises some in Babylon as true to Him and addresses them now, saying: “Come out of her,</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">My people'* </span><span class="font4">(Rev. 18:4), so do we; and we rejoice to believe that there are today thousands who have not bowed the knee to the Baal of our day—Mammon, Pride and Ambition.

<p><span class="font3">In reply to many inquiries, we have prepared </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font3">letter of withdrawal which such as desire are at liberty to use. If possible, it should be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">read</span><span class="font3"> aloud at some general congregational meeting, at which general speaking, remarks, etc., are in order-such as a prayer-meeting.

If by reason of sickness or from any other cause this course be not possible, we advise that a copy of the letter be sent to each member of the congregation, that there be no room for misunderstanding or misrepresentation.

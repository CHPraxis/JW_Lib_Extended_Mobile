<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">made us free, and be not entangled again with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">yoke of bondage.&quot;—Gal. 5:1,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Although the Christian recognizes his special allegiance to the Heavenly? King and sets his affections chiefly ■upon the heavenly home and feels a hroad kinship with the entire groaning creation of every nation, people, kindred and tongue, he, nevertheless, returning from a visit abroad and passing the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, is bound to feel grateful to God for America, and the torch of enlightenment which it has lifted before the masses of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let us not go to the unwarranted extreme of some; let us not call this land of the free the Kingdom of God established on earth; but let us on the contrary realize that with all of America’s blessings and enlightenment and advantages everyway for both the poor and the rich, she is far from perfect! Let us, while appreciating our glorious land, and our wonderful blessings therein, rejoice that a still better Government and still more favorable conditions are part of the heavenly promise to the world of mankind! Let us rejoicingly continue to pray to the Lord, “Thy Kingdom come; thy Will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Let Us Think Soberly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">8t. Paul urged believers, “Let us think soberly,’? according as God has granted • to each a measure of his gtace. Hence the Christian’s rejoicing is not boastful, but tempered with moderation. He sympathizes with the groaning creation in other parts of the World and does not ignore the faults </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">his native land, even while he does not unduly magnify and parade them. In all soberness, however, Bartholdi’s statue of Liberty Enlightening the World is true to the facts of the case. He would be blind indeed who failed to recognize the great influences which the principle of liberty established here exercises all over the world. When Liberty was born on these shores, rocked in the cradle of the Revolution, it had not kith nor kin in any part of the world. Europe alone had civilization, but not even it had Liberty. Everywhere the barons ruled and the masses, comparatively ignorant, rejoiced to submit. Liberty and equality and manhood were almost unrecognized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As Liberty emerged from its cradle a stalwart youth, its influence and example shook Europe and threatened to overthrow it with Revolution as accomplished in France. And when finally better counsels prevailed, aristocracy realized that its days were numbered, unless concessions were made to the liberties of the people. It yielded with good grace, with the result that the monarchies of Europe are no longer despotic, but limited, parliamentary; the people have a vote and voice in their own government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The blessings of liberty came to Europeans so slowly that few of them probably today recognize how very different were the conditions a century ago, and how gradually the change has come about. The most advanced nations of Europe have only quite recently granted suffrage to the people, find, even yet.it is. under limitations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nowhere is the'standard of manhood recognized as in this land. All the reforms of Europe of the past century, directly or indirectly, owe their impulse to the example of America. As the sons and daughters of Europe by the thousands and the millions have ccme to these shores they have learned the blessings of liberty and the meaning of manhood. And their letters to their brethren at home, filled with their new conception of human rights, have had a leavening influence upon the bureaucratic and monarchical theories and institutions of the old world. Yes, Bartholdi had it right! Liberty has been enlightening the world during the past century!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Mysterious Ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is not for us to boast, but to think’ soberly. Whence came the light of liberty’s torch? We answer that the spark was divine. In a certain sense and degree this spark and torch were given to Abraham’s natural seed, the Hebrew naTlon, in the Divine Law, at the hand of Moses. Later the antitype of Moses, “Christ, brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel” message. Of our Lord it is written, “He is the true light which llght-eth every man that cometh into the world.” Our assertion, therefore, Ig that whatever blessing there is in the light which shines from Liberty’s torch is the light of the Gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Notice the language of our text, “The liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free.” Of course man, originally made in the Divine likeness, must have had the love of liberty in his very constitution; but thousands of years of experience in slavery to sin and death have considerably crushed out the proper conception of liberty-godlike liberty. It is to these sinners or perverts from the Divine likeness that the Lord Jesus offers the true liberty. Note the effect that this Gospel message had upon the early Church. It made them a “peculiar people.” It broke from them the shackles of superstition'‘which firmly held their fellow men. It gave them higher, broader, deeper views of human rights and human responsibilities. It taught them that all men are sinners and that the King and the peasant, the learned and the ignorant, are all responsible to the one God and that he is no respecter of persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a consequence, Christians came to be generally recognized because of the influence of Christ’s message of liberty, which effected their every interest with its enlightening influences. We read that the people took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus and had learned of him. They learned of Jesus no lessons of anarchy or strife, but those which taught the proper relationship between man and man. They were also taught to live peaceably, to endure, to suffer, to wait for justice until God’s time would come; when, at the Second Advent of Christ, his Kingdom would be established and “justice would be laid to the line and righteousness to the plummet.” Of the Apostles we remember that it is written that the rul&amp;rs were astonished at their courage in standing up for principle in faithfulness to the TMvinA ‘W’nrrl ThowmarTnlarl €» + annh courage Th men whom they perceived to be “ignorant and unlearned.” The fact is that having learned in the School of Christ the real principles of righteousness and the relationship of the things of the present time to the things eternal—these were transformed men, whose balance of mind, of judgment, was in accord with their knowledge—lessons in the School of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A Great Falling Away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">St. Paul, and indeed all of the apostles, prophetically declared that before the Second Coming of Christ a great falling away would occur in the Church, which would affect the whole world. These declarations came true in the period known as the “dark ages,” when the Word of God was inaccessible to the people and when the teachers of the Church turned aside from waiting for the Son of God to establish the Millennial Kingdom, and codabored with earthly princes to use the name of Christ interwoven with Ignorance and superstition and a chain of slavery, whereby the people would, be restrained of their religious liber-<sub>( </sub>ties, in order that they might not ap-<sub>( </sub>predate their political liberties. The School of Christ and its enlightening power belong by right merely to the fully consecrated, “The sanctified in Christ Jesus.” But others, their relatives, neighbors and friends in large numbers partook of the spirit of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">liberty </span><span class="font2">without accepting the spirit of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">conse-oration.</span><span class="font2"> The result of this spirit under present conditions, it may easily be seen, would be anarchy. Hence the princes, kings and emperors were glad to have the ministers of Christ come to their aid in binding and re* straining the people. Nevertheless^ nothing has occurred that God did not foresee, and that he is not able to overrule eventually for the advantage the blessing of such as are truly his.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Lifting ths Veil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Evolutionists tell us that the liberty and attendant blessings of our day, are because of Evolution; but they do not explain why or how Evolution should so suddenly lift the veil of ignorance and superstition from the race; why it should so suddenly bring to us the blessings of invention, skill through machinery ministering to our comforts in ten thousand ways undreamed of a generation ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Bible answer to the question </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Is </span><span class="font2">that God’s due time has come, and therefore these blessings, which are a part of and leading up to the Millennial Age conditions, are ours. The great clock of the Universe, under Divine regulation, has been keeping perfect time. At the proper stroke of the hour ;ne Jewish Age began, at the death of Jacob, in the close of the Patriarchal Age. Again, at the proper stroke of the hour the Gospel Age began, at the close of the Jewish Age, at the death and resurrection of Jesus. And now likewise at the dawning of the Millennial Age and the close of the Gospel Age—coming exactly on .time,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CALL DIVINE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">To-day, to-morrow, evermore,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through cheerless nights without a Star, Not asking whither or how far, Rejoicing though the way be sore, Take up thy cross And follow Me!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I cannot promise wealth or ease,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fame, pleasure, length of days, esteem— These things are vainer than they seem— If thou canst turn from all of these, Take up thy cross And follow Me! </span><span class="font2">ail Ute events properly connected and rightly understood show that our great Creator is w’orking all things accord-, Ing to the counsel of his own will and' that the world’s present experiences are wholly of Divine prearrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Looking from this standpoint, we no-tlce that in Divine providence Americas was hidden from the world until God’s due time for its discovery. It was opened for settlement at a time wheal religious persecution was rife in Europe, when a man had no liberty event ■ to think for himself—no liberty to wor-' ship his God according to the dictates! of his own conscience. It was under) Divine providence, doubtless, that the&gt; Pilgrim fathers reached these shores!: and cast their influence with that of| others in bringing forth the child of; Liberty. In God’s providence variousi religious sentiments were at that time) so evenly balanced that all of the col-! onies gladly arranged for religious) freedom, which really meant a higher; standard, a more Christi ike standard than had been known in the world/ since the days of the apostles. It iar this spirit of Liberty in which there! has mingled a considerable measure of$ the light of the cross, the light of the world, that has brought the bless* ing and enlightening effect upon thia land and upon the world; and with it, in God’s providence, has come a mental enlightenment born partly of that liberty and partly of avarice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What Will the Harvest Bei</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God has not granted us prophetic vision whereby to declare the future of this goodly land, which has had so much of his blessing thus far; yet he does in the Scriptures portray in a general way what we may expect. And, alas, it is a sad picture from one standpoint. The Scriptures show a very dark cloud overhanging liberty and the world. But, thank God, they show a silver lining to that cloud to those who have the eyes to see it—the spiritual perception. The Bible teaches us that the inventions of our day and Its enlightenment will, under the operation of avarice, prove to be the upper and the nether millstones which will crush humanity terribly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How can these things come about, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font2">you ask? We reply that the inventions of our day, which are bringing so many blessings to the whole people at so little cost, are gradually drifting into “strong hands,” the hands of trusts and capital. Some of these, indeed, have been and are yet blessings, helpful In many ways. Yet the concentration of power into the hands of a few is too strong a temptation to be long resisted. The day is not distant when the leverage will be used gradually to draw the coveted wealth more and more to the coffers of the trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Meantime liberty and enlightenment have been doing more than merely glv* ing us mechanical inventions and helpful. contrivances and comforts. They have given us thought, intelligence, compulsory education, breadth jof mind</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I promise only perfect peace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sweet peace that lives through years of strife,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Eternal love, immortal life,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And rest when all these wanderings </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">cease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Take up thy cross And follow Me!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">My yoke is easy—put it on;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">My burden very light to bear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Who shareth this, my crown shall share—</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The present cross insures the crown.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">We cannot doubt that men will learn this lesson very soon.

<p><span class="font2">Yes, we answer, God will interfere, but not in the time and manner, nor fbr the purpose generally expected.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Silver Lining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thank God, the Scriptures give usf a view of the silver lining behind the clouds of trouble; assuring us that at Its conclusion the Whole World Will<sup>1 </sup>Have learned a most valuable lesson in the furnace of its affliction. Both parties to the strife, humbled by their utter failure, will be ready to acknowledge Messiah King of kings and Lord of lords. Many nations shall go and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem” (Isaiah ii, 3). Of the glories and blessings of that Millennial day the prophecies of old are replete With testimony. But the chief bless-* ing then to be brought to mankind under the reign of Messiah’s Kingdom will be the knowledge of the glory of the Lord. All men shall come to ap- . preciate the Divine character and its principles of Righteousness—Justice, Love, Wisdom and Power—that all men might,^after experiencing the bitter and the sweet, the evil and the good, know how thereafter to choose the good, in harmony with the Divine Law, and, by obedience, come to everlasting life and joy and blessing. It is of that happy time, we remember, that St. Peter assures us, saying, “Times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you; whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” The Apostle additionally informs us that whoever will not accept the righteous regulations of that government shall perish in the Second Death; “And it shall come to pass that every soul' which Will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people” (Acts til, 10-23).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1:4), and to share with Christ the work those who accept his grace during the Millennial age is a restitution .or restoration of the perfections of human nature (lost by sin), in Paradise restored —the new earth?—Acts 3:19-21; Rev. 21:1-4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Christian people have forgotten and Worldly people never knew the significance of pur text. We are all familiar with the beautiful hymn which inquires, “What will the harvest be?” and which gives the' suggestion that in each life-experience there is a sowing and a reaping. This is true and we will examine this phase Of the sub'-ject by a*d by; but first we call your attention to the' fact that our Lord in reaping work and associated ciples .with himself, saying, you to reap that whereon stowed no labor [other men harrowed, sowed], and ye are into their labors,” as reapers of the fruitage of other toil. The truthfulness of this is manifest and is corroborated by the statement of John the Baptist, who declared of our Lord that he was the Reaper of the Jewish Age whose fan was in his hand, and who did purge the threshing floor, and did gather the wheat into the barn and burned up the chaff with unquenchable fire. (Matt. 3:12.) Looking back over Jewish history we see that the harvesting of the Jewish Age began with our Lord’s first advent and ended forty years later at the destruction of Jerusalem. In that time he gathered all the wheat of that nation, all who were ready for the Kingdom. (John 1:12.) These were comparatively a “little flock.” They were all “Israelites indeed in whom was no der] with fire.” All not baptised with the holy Spirit, all not adopted thus into the family of God, received their share in the baptism of fire, trouble* which came upon that nation, and to it the Apostle refers saying, Wrath to the uttermost is come upon this people, that all things written in the Law and prophets concerning them should be fulfilled. — 1 Thess. 2:16; Matt. 5:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A DOUBLE WORK PROGRESSING.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the foregoing it will be perceived that during the harvest period of the Jewislj Age a two-fold work progressed—the harvest of the Jewish Age &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preparatory work for the Gospel Age, a reaping work and ® settling time as respecting the Jews an# their covenant relationship to God and. simultaneously the opening of the new dispensation, in which the middle^ Wall of partition between Jews and Gentiles was in due course broken down arid all who received Christ, whether Jew or Gentile, bond or free, were accepted of the Lord as members of the New House of sons, which took ants—“Moses verily was faithful as a servant over all his house [of servants], but Christ as a son over his own house [of sons], whose house are we if we hold fast.”—Heb. 3:5, 6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The parable of the wheat and the tares, to which our text belongs, was a brief statement by our Ldrd of his work in the world during this Gospel Age. The foundation of it he laid im his redemptive work, tlje work itself properly began with the bestowmerit of the holy Spirit of Pentecost. Our Lord declares that he sowed the good seed of the Kingdom. In harmony with this we find that he continually taught his disciples that the Jews were right in their expectation of the establishment of God’s Kingdom amongst men for the overthrow of sin and Satart, and for the deliverance and uplift of Adam and his race. But he instructed them that his Kingdom was not of this world, not an earthly kingdom, and that his servants were not to fight with weapons of carnal warfare for the establishment of his Kingdom. It would be established at his second coming in power and great glory. It would have all power and to it every knee would bow, every tongue confess. It would not oppress, but would bless its subjects and fully restrain it® enemies and ultimately destroy the impenitent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THY KINGDOM COME ON EARTH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus he taught his disciples, and usr through them, to pray for the coming Kingdom as the Divine boon and blessing most desirable. He said, &quot;Pray ye, Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is done in</span></p>

Tn his Kingdom, some of his glorified servants would be granted dominion over two cities, some over five, some over ten and thus all would be jointheirs with him in his Kingdom, sharers of his throne, partakers in his great work of uplifting Adam and. his race out of their present fallen conditions, mental, moral and physical.—</span></p>

Some of these parables show this Kingdom class, the Church, as a nominal system containing good and bad, faithful and unfaithful, saints and imposters; as, for instance, the</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">parable of the het Which, cast into the sea, gathered both suitable and unsuitable fish throughout this age, though the separation was not due to be accomplished until the end of this age. Similarly the parable we are discussing shows two classes in the Church, one, the “wheat” class, begotten of the holy Spirit, the other, the “tare” or imitation class, not begotten of the Spirit of the Lord, but rather of the wrong spirit, the spirit of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">AN ENEMY DID THIS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our parable shows that the Lord and his faithful disciples sowed the good seed of Kingdom promises, but that subsequently our enemy, Satan, over-sowed the field with treacherous and false doctrines. As the true doctrines bring forth the true “wheat” class suitable for the Kingdom, and false doctrines produce wrong characters, “tares,” which today all over Christendom are so that tile true wheat are being choked out. Indeed, so accustomed is the world to the high look of the “tare” class that the humble “wheat” are thought peculiar and a strange party of undesirables. So closely intertwined are the roots of the two classes that the great Reaper decided that there would be no separation between them until the harvest or end of this age; because to disturb such close relationship in life ■would create a great commotion, such a time of trouble as would wreck pres-'■ ent institutions; hence the Lord’s decision was, “Let both grow together -until the harvest; the harvest is the end of the age.” At what time the great commotion incidental to the complete separation of the small harvest of* wheat from the; great harvest of tares would be due and the great time of trouble incidental to the separation would find its proper place in connection with the proper judgments with which this age will end and the proper plowing experiences of trouble with which the new dispensation will be inaugurated.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Dear friends, in two of the volumes of the “Scripture Studies,” which many of you possess and I trust are studying, we have presented from the Scriptures the evidence that the harvest of this Gospel Age is forty years in length and. that aireddy considerable more than one half of it is in the past. We have pointed out that this is the meaning and the true interpre-. taiion of the peculiar conditions, favorable and. unfavorable, which now surround the pathway of. all of the Lord's people. This is the explanation of the federation movement among the among the wealthy and of the union movement amongst the masses. The awfUl time of trouble which shortly as a plowshare will prepare mankind for the new dispensation, the Millennial Kingdom of Christ and his Church, is even now casting its shadow before. Already our Lord’s prediction of it is being realized, “Men’s hearts are failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming upon the earth.” (Luke 21:26.) The courageous are saying, “Peace and safety,” but the Scriptures declare that the consummation of the age is upon us and that nothing can avert it; that the destruction will come with suddenness, “as pangs upon a mother,” with brief respites between, but gradually increasing in intensity until the new dispensation, the Kingdom off God’s dear Son, shall be -born in the morning of the new day—“The Sun of Righteousness shall rise with heating in his beams.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Iff we are right, the present is the time for God’s people to draw very near to the Lord* to come under the shadow of the Almighty, to put their trust more and more in him and to purge themselves from all filthiness of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting holiness in the reverence of the Lord (2 Cor. 7:1.) As the harvest of the Jewish Age brought fresh tests to nominal Israel, so. the present harvest period will surely bring fresh tests to nominal Spiritual Israel, tests which only the faithful, the saintly, will be able to stand. The fiery trials of this day will try every man’s faith and work? of what sort they aye. Only the gold, silver and precious stones of Divine truth and faith and character will survive these tests. The wood, hay and stubble character, like the tares of our text-parable, will succumb to the fiery trials of this great and notable day of the Lord, toward which the eyes of the prophets of God and of our Lord and of his apostles all looked —the day of which they all made mention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now is the time for the fulfilment of Malachi 3:16, when They that feared the Lord [that reverenced him] spake often one to another [conferred respecting his promises and sought to be helpful to each other] a&gt;d a book of remembrance was written for these and to them was given the assurance they shall be mine, saith the Lord, in the day when I come to make up my jewels. It is pertinent to our topic that we inquire one of another respecting our preparation for the evil day into which we are entering. Have we on the whole armour of God; are we standing firmly ourselves and helping the brethren to stand firmly against the wiles of the Adversary, our common foe; have We on the wedding garment of Christ’s righteousness, faith in his blood?

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Before not only and now age and preparing for the greater sowing and reaping of the Millennial Age, but that each of us, and indeed all mankind, outside as well inside the Church of Christ, does a sowing and a reaping work in respect to his own life and interests. The beginning of all of our sowing is in the mind, or, as. the Scriptures would say, in the heart: Out of the heart proceedeth the various good and bad influences which go to make up our characters. What we sow, we will reap in time. If we sow anger, malice, hatred, envy, strife, ambition, vainglory, bitterness, backbitings, evil-surmising we will reap accordingly. What a sad harvest results from such a sowing! How many fold these evils are multiplied to ourselves and to others! And how far-reaching may be the influence of these evil things upon others! They ripen, they go to seed, they are blown by the winds of gossip and suspicion and many are thereby defiled. “What will the harvest be?” Surely the harvest of such a sowing will be with bitterness and tears proportionate to the degree of knowledge enjoyed and sinned against.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is bad enough, that the world, uninstructed of the Lord, with no ears to hear his counsel, should sow such</span></p>

What the world needs is to get over its fright respecting the Lord and the future and to see the Love of God, and his gracious provision in Christ. This alone will win the heart, in the proper sense of .the word.

<p><span class="font2">The fright that is upon the world came from the Dark Ages, echoed by all the creeds of orthodoxy, breeding in the hearts of men distrust, fear, hatred of God and of the Bible,which is falsely accredited with being the Fountain from which these brackish waters of tradition represented by the Creeds, have been drawn. It is time that every true Christian should take his stand for the right, the Truth, for the Word of God, for the exposition of the falsehoods which have slandered the Almighty character, which have benumbed the zeal of the saints, and have&quot; repelled the weary and the heavy laden as they looked for relief and balm in the direction of their Creator. Is it not time that all ministers of the Gospel announced and manifested their freedom from the creedal mis-statements of the Divine hearts they long ago have rejected? It is well that all such should lift up their voice like a trumpet and give no uncertain sound to the masses of the groaning creation, who are awakening and hunger-</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Thank God for the assurances of hh Word that the spasm will be but a brief one; that “A short work will the Lord make with the earth,” and that everything has been prepared for the establishment of the Millennial Kingdom upon the ruins of present systems. It is folly to think of holding the people back and bandaging the eyes of their understanding and to again enslave them with ignor ance and superstition. Thosewho are thus endeavoring to meet the situation show clearly that they do not understand it. The tidal wave of liberty of mind can no more be repressed than the ocean tide can be swept, stayed with a broom. There is just one remedy, the Truth, and a correct understanding of the teachings of the Bible. Whoever fails to receive the Truth fails of everything with respect to the present life. And this applies not only to the world in general, but also to believers, to the entire Church of Christ. The hour degree of faith. The Scriptures declare, trial predicted to come upon the whole “He that cometh unto God must believe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1S</sup>,<sup>n</sup>2<sup>w</sup> upon .us, and the Apostle</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">that he is, and that he is a rewarder of .5,<sup>er</sup>.? declaration is that it must begin them that diligently seek him.” (Heb. ' with the Church of God.

<p><span class="font2">.This is the message which we bear to the troubled and discouraged ones. They must take our word for it, until they have time to take up with us a thorough study of the Scriptures, and to demonstrate to themselves that the justice, wisdom, love and power of God are all enlisted on behalf of Adam and his race—to do us good, to save us from our sins and from the dead and dying condition in which we find ourselves, mentally, morally and physically. Nor should it be so difficult to exercise this mind that God should be just and lovfiig towards all. The thought of an angry, vindictive, torture-loving, unloving Creator should be rejected instantly by every rational mind, as being ungodlike, demoniacal. And no doubt this would have been so had it not been that the misconception on the subject, which the Apostle calls the Doctrine of Devils, was imposed upon our minds from our very earliest childhood, and often by those whom we properly loved and whose piety we reverenced, but who were themselves deceived.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">It is high time that more reverential, more loving, theological views were seen by all mankind. It is the lack of this true theology that is driving many away from the Lord and his Word, into vain philosophies and “science falsely so-called”—-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Higher Criticism, Christian Science, Evolution, Theosophy, etc., etc.—1 Tim. 6:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The world has discovered that the bonds of ignorance and superstition have been holding it for centuries, and that its eyes of understanding have been so long covered that now they blink in the dazzling light of the dawning Millennial Day. At one bound the so-called scientific world has left the Word of God and leaped into a refined agnosticism, which professes a faith which it .does not possess. The middle class and the lower class of Society are ready to follow their leaders, and this means very shortly what the Scriptures predict, “A great time of trouble, such as never was since High thee.&quot; (Psa. 91:7.) The statement </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the Apostle, respecting the same time and trial, is, “ Put on the whole armour </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. . . . Take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.” (Eph. 6:11-13.) Not, Who shall fall, but “Who shall be able to stand?” is the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">LENGTH, BREADTH, HEIGHT, DEPTH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are not able to tell the wonderful measures of God s love—nor can others tell them. Indeed, as the Apostle suggests, the privilege of appreciating these measurements is granted only to the “saints,” and to these in proportion to their saintliness. Thus a babe in Christ, though beloved of the Lord and carefully cherished, cannot, as an infantile saint, comprehend these measurements of Divine character. When first he believed in the Lord he saw something of Divine love and mercy, which influenced him and drew him to the exercise of faith and the renouncement of sin. From that standpoint of Justification by Faith he could see more of the Lord, and appreciate more the measurements of his greatness. Then, called and appreciating the call, he bound his heart before the Lord and made a full surrender to him in response to the invitation, “Ibeseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.” —Rom. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Having thus done all in his power and laid himself at the Lord’s feet, he received the begetting of the holy Spirit, not with outward show or demonstration, but with inward grace and the enlightenment of the eyes of his understanding. From this new standpoint of consecration and harmony with the Divine will, he began to see more of the length, more of the breadth, more of the height, more of the depth of God’s love, and hourly, daily, monthly, yearly, if living up to his privileges faithfully, he has been growing in grace, growing in knowledge, growing in opportunity to see these measurements of the Divine character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Note that this is the very expression of our text and context: the reception by faith of Christ into our hearts, as a rule brought strengthening, mighty strengthening by his Spirit in the innerman, to the new nature. As this Spirit of Christ dwelt or resided in our hearts by faith, it tended to root us and to ground us in his character-likeness, which is the same as that of the Father—Love. Now, then, all this experience makes us able to comprehend with all saints these measure-riencing the resurrection “change” from earthly to heavenly nature, shall see our Lord as he is and then know as we are known. How grand will be this consummation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So in our text, which applies to the. present life, the Apostle declares that the saints even cannot know the love of Christ, because it “passeth knowledge.” He then gives a further intimation of how this keen appreciation of the glorious character of God comes to his consecrated ones, namely, by their being “filled with the fulness of God.” This means, dear friends, not only the renouncement of sin, and faith in the Lord as our Redeemer and consecration to him, but a filling with his spirit, his mind, his disposition. This, as already stated, is a gradual work, “ Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord.” The Lord’s Spirit is one of holiness, not only of separateness from sin, but of opposition to it; not only of sympathy with righteousness, but' of activity on its behalf; not only of putting away from our hearts every sympathy with unfruitful works of darkness, but also the receiving of that spirit which condemns them by daily life and a word fitly spoken; not only by an appreciation of the fruits and graces of God’s Spirit—meekness, gentleness, longsuffering, brotherly kindness, love— but so great an appreciation of them as more and more induces us to stamp these gracious characteristics of Divinity upon our own thoughts and words and deeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus it is that we become “copies.of God's dear Son,” and “meet for the inheritance of the saints in light.” To these more and more the Father is pleased to grant the opening of the eyes of their understanding, even to appreciation of the things of the Spirit-—“The deep things of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. PAUL PRAYED FOR THEM.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The great Apostle not only preached Christ and shunned not to declare the whole counsel of God, but he never once refers to eternal torment or anything akin to it. No, not in all of his writings, which constitute more than one-half of the New Testament Scriptures! The severest penalty that he ever declared was everlasting destruction, the Second Death, from which there is no hope of deliverance. Undoubtedly he was right in this course. On the contrary he preached and wrote not only about the length and breadth and height and depth of the love of Christ, but in the context (verse 14) he tells us that he prayed for the Church, that they might be able to attain such and more of God’s love. Undoubtedly this is the great need of the Church to-day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let us all pray for ourselves and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tot </span><span class="font2">each other a wider opening of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">eyes </span><span class="font2">of our understanding, and a still more full comprehension of the love of God,</span></p>

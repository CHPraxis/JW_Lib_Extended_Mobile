<p><span class="font4">“Judged by human standards man is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">far </span><span class="font4">better prepared to write a Bible now </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">than </span><span class="font4">when our Bible was written. The characters whose words and deeds are recorded in the Bible were members of a single race; they lived among the hills </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Palestine in a territory scarcely larger than one of our counties. They did not have printing presses and they lacked the learning of our schools; they had not great libraries to consult, no steamboats to carry them around the world and make them acquainted with the various centers of civilization; they had no telegraph </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">wires to </span><span class="font4">bring them news from the ends of the earth and no newspapers to spread before them each morning the doings of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the day </span><span class="font4">before. From what a scantily supplied storehouse of knowledge they </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">had to </span><span class="font4">draw, compared with the unlim</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ited </span><span class="font4">wealth of information at man’s command today! And yet, these Bible char</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">acters </span><span class="font4">grapple with every problem that confronts mankind from the creation of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">world to eternal life beyond the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“None but divinely appointed men, with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font4">limited opportunities and facilities </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and the </span><span class="font4">lack of knowledge of other peo</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ple, </span><span class="font4">could have written a work that all </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">philosophers of the world today, with millions of books to cultivate their minds </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">telegraph wires that keep them in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">touch </span><span class="font4">with the pulse of all mankind, could </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font4">approach in logic, reasoning, example </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">precept.”—William </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">J. </span><span class="font4">Bryan.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>HEART AND STOMACH WORK IN GLASS JARS.</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">iheart, stomach and kidneys, transferred from the casement of flesh to glass jars in his laboratory by Dr. Alexis Carrel, of the Rockefeller Institute, are now performing their normal functions. This startling announcement was made by Dr. Carrel himself to a group of scientists who listened breathlessly to his account of his latest achievement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. </span><span class="font4">Carrel has kept </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">heart, taken from its body, alive for 104 days. Uis success with this experiment strength</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ened </span><span class="font4">his belief, he said, that the stomach </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">other vital organs of animals could </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">transferred from one body to another without cessation of their normal func</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tions. He </span><span class="font4">experimented with a heart, stomach and kidneys and told the scientists :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The heart is beating, the stomach, is digesting and the kidneys performing their functions as well as ever, while, the body that contained them is long since dead.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New York American.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>BATTLE OF ARMAGEDDON.</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">At an </span><span class="font4">inter-denominational meeting </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in New </span><span class="font4">York City recently, the Rev. Charles Jefferson gave expression to these fitting </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In every capital of Europe you see </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">gleam of the bayonet and hear the tramp of armed men getting, ready for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">battle that is coming,” said </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. </span><span class="font4">Jefferson. Tn the air you see a fleet of ehips in which men are practising with bombs that they may send cities to destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We preachers have not done much, but </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font4">must do something. We can denounce the present system of maintaining great engines of war. We can insist that pur diplomats be men of peace. \&gt;e can insist that our government work for peace. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font4">ought to make the idea of war incredible. When we cease believing in war </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font4">will have peace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Scientists of Denver are making a study of the three-year-old son of an Italian washerwoman and a Spanish laborer. The boy is regarded as an infant prodigy. He not only knows his alphabet and can write it. but speaks English, Italian and Spanish. lie sings ■remarkably well, dances and plays on four stringed instruments. The physicians declare that the child is normal, but possesses the most wonderful intelligence they have ever encountered in one so young.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">THE CHIEF CAUSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">OF^CRIMINALITY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Psalm</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">D</span><span class="font4">IAGNOSIS is valuable in the attempted cure of any malady. This is as true of sin-sickness, depravity, as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">any other ailment of humanity. The better we understand the origin of sin and the methods of its operation in ourselves and in others, the more successful we shall be in combating it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font4">must know what helps to feed the ailment and what tends to destroy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Our </span><span class="font4">forefathers erred, evidently, in their declaration of total depravity. None of us ever met a human being entirely depraved—entirely devoid of sympathy for righteousness and truth— dead to all good influences. Experience, however, does corroborate the Bible statement that “there is none righteous, no, not one”—all are sinners. Moreover, the Bible goes to the root of the matter; and experience corroborates its statement in our text—that we and all humanity were born in a state of sin, with the predilection or inclination toward sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are not, however, to conclude that God made us sinners; for the Bible contradicts this thought, and assures us that “all His work is perfect.” According to the Bible, we received our lives from our parents; and they theirs from their parents; and so on back to Father Adam. The Bible tells us that our first parents sinned, and came under the Divine sentence of death; and that this meant mental and moral, as well as physical, degeneracy. The Apostle declares, “By one man’s disobedience sin entered into the world, and death by sin.”—Romans 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This curse of death which came upon the race, and which affects us from the moment of birth, is a terrible blight. Even though it is much more reasonable than the curse declared by our mistaken creeds—the curse of eternal torment— nevertheless the curse of God is sufficiently terrible, and world-wide. The penalty, “Dying, thou shalt die,” is, however, much less horrible than if it had read, “Living, thou shalt live in eternal torment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When, therefore, we find in ourselves and others wayward, sinful tendencies, we reflect that these are evidences of the fall, the curse, and that all who are under such influences are to be pitied. True pity, however, must not be in sympathy with sin, but with the sinner, who is handicapped by the predisposition to sin. Sin calls for radical measures for its extermination for the release of the sinner; but our best efforts for them and for others will be attained through a knowledge of the facts, and through the exercise of proper sympathy. There are probably more people injured through lack of sympathetic help than are helped by the administration of cold-blooded justice without tenderness or sympathy. We have been slow to learn this lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Parental Sympathy Needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Undoubtedly as human sympathy expands through a knowledge of the facts, both parents and children will be blessed by that increase of knowledge. Parents need to learn that their own mental moods and sympathies with right or wrong serve to stamp, to birth-mark their children, either favorably or unfavorably. The parents of a vicious child should reflect that they had much to do with that viciousness. Properly informed and right-willed, they might have produced the child with a much more favorable organism. It requires a great deal of training to work out of the child’s disposition that which was inbred at its birth. Indeed, the probability is that only a small portion of it will ever be eradicated in this life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are not forgetting the Scripture ■which says, “Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?” We remember this, and merely suggest that the imperfect sinner-child, shapen in iniquity and conceived in sin, may have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">less of</span><span class="font4"> sinful disposition. We are suggesting tnat a weighty responsibility</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">rests upon parents in respect to the prenatal influences exercised, as well as to their parental obligations after their children are born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With what care, what loyalty </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to God </span><span class="font4">and righteousness, what desire to maintain purity of heart and loveliness of character, the procreative powers should be exercised ! With what care the father should surround the mother with every good influence helpful to her mental serenity, joy, peace, justice, reverence, love, during tae period of gestation ’ What noble characters might thus be born into the world, even though still imperfect, sin-stained ! What a different world in many respects we might be living in to-day if parents had recognized these principles and felt their responsibilities and lived up to them I Thank God, death does not end all I and the lessors now being learned through disappointments and tears will, we believe, in many instances prove profitable in the great Hereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Brethren What Shall We Do?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This was the question asked of the Apostle Peter by those who heard him preach and learned that we were sinners under condemnation. We should discern that the question is not, What shall we do to escape damnation, or condemnation? We were born in damnation, condemned to death as unworthy of life. The Divine decree is that no sinner may have everlasting life. It is a gift of God, designed, m t for sinners, but for those who are perfect, sinless. Adam was condemned to death as soon as he became a transgressor; and all of his children were born in the same condemned condition. Condemnation passed upon all men because all are sinners. All are imperfect, fallen. Our text tells us that they were born in this fallen, disapproved or condemned condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The question ■with us, then, is not, What shall we do to escape coming under condemnation? for the whole world is condemned already. (John 3:18.) The question is, How shall we, who are already condemned of God as unworthy of everlasting life, get free from that condition in which we were born and get back into that .condition of perfection which God will approve, in which we shall be accounted worthy of everlasting life?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible answers our question. It tells us that God has had compassion upon our race and has provided the Savior. It explains that for God to be just and yet grant forgiveness to the sinner requires that One shall pay substi-tutionally the penalty originally pronounced against Father Adam. This being effected, the Redeemer will have the right to restore to perfection Adam and all his posterity desirous of returning to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Message respecting this merciful arrangement is called the Gospel—the Good Tidings that there is a way of return from sin to holiness and from condemnation to death back to justification of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Times of Restitution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As w<sup>T</sup>e have seen, the thing needful for all who desire to return to God’s favor is that they may be restored to that condition of physical perfection in w’hich Adam was before he sinned. When thus restored, they will have the same opportunity of demonstrating loyalty to God that Adam had at first. If they, when recovered, stand the tests of loyalty and obedience, they shall receive God’s gift of everlasting life. And they shall receive it through Jesus Oh ri st; for the way was opened up by His sacrificial death, “the Just for the unjust,” and their salvation accomplished by His work of Restitution.—1 Peter 3 :18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">_ Not until recently have Bible students discerned how far our forefathers have been confused in respect to the Divine Plan—through neglect of the Bible for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1,400 </span><span class="font4">years. They now see that Jesus</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">and the Apostles and Prophets taught that God’s great time for dealing with the world is yet future—under Messiah’s Kingdom. The thousand years in which that Kingdom shall rule the world, restraining sin, chastising sinners and helping the willing and obedient back to perfection, is called by St. Peter “Times of Restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by all His holy Prophets.”—Aeta 3:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The restitutionary work </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">those </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">thou</span><span class="font4">sand years will be accomplished by the power of Messiah’s Kingdom, and the Elect Church of this Gospel Age will be associated with the Redeemer in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">His </span><span class="font4">Throne and in the great work </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of restor</span><span class="font4">ing the obedient of mankind to perfection. This thousand years is also called the time of the world’s resurrection </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font4">raising up—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">anastasis.</span><span class="font4"> Bible students now discern that the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">resurrection </span><span class="font4">in the Greek signifies more than merely the awakening from death. It signifies the lifting up of the individuals to human perfection—to that which was lost by Adam and redeemed by Jesus’ death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During those Times of Restitution Satan is to be bound, that he may </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font4">longer deceive humanity as he has been doing with false doctrines, putting light for darkness and darkness for light. On the contrary, the time when he, the Prince of Darkness, is cast down from influence amongst men will be the time when Christ and His Bride, the Church, will become the Sun of Righteousness to the world and scatter all its ignorance ami superstition. (Matthew 13 :43.) </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Re</span><span class="font4">specting that time the Bible assures </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">us </span><span class="font4">that all the sin-blinded eyes shall </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">opened, and all the sin-deaf ears shall </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">unstopped, and the true Message of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s </span><span class="font4">Love shall be made known, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“the </span><span class="font4">knowledge of the glory of the Lord </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">shall </span><span class="font4">fill the whole earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Dealing with the Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God has a special plan and a special salvation for the Church. He desires that the Church shall consist of a very special class. He has issued a special call therefor, and has prescribed special terms or conditions for members of this class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All who will be accepted as members of the Bride, the Lamb’s Wife, must have the same spirit, mind or disposition that Jesus had. Did He delight to do the Father’s will? So must th.se. Was He willing to be obedient to the Father’s will to the extent of sacrificing earthly pleasures and advantages? and to the extent of death? So must His followers walk in His steps, as He has set them an example,. looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their faith. The invitation to those is that if they suffer with Christ they may also reign with Him, share His nature and glory and honor. They are advised from the first that the footsteps of Jesus are the way of the Cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These disciples of Jesus in the present Age are figuratively styled “soldiers of the Cross,” and Jesus is declared to be the Captain of their salvation, leading them through victories to glory. Their battle in some respects is the same as the world .will have in the next Age, only more intense, more concentrated. The world will have a thousand years in wiiich to fight and win. The battle of the Church as a whole is more than eighteen centuries long; but each individual share is much shorter. The coming Age. will be the world’s time for gaining a victory and escaping from the condemnation, the imperfection, that came upon ail the race through Adam’s sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Children of Wrath as Others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are not to think of those whom God accepts as the Church as being different by nature from the remainder of mankind. On the contrary, we are particularly informed that we were born “children of wrath, even as others.” But this special class get free from the condemnation, or damnation, that came upon the race through Adam in a different way from that of the world in the next Age. They first exercise faith in God’s promises and in Jesus as the Redeemer. They realize </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">by faith</span><span class="font4"> that the merit of His death is the basis of deliverance from the damnation, or condemnatioh, passed upon all and of reconciliation with God</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARING TO RESTORE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Jews are preparing to restore the temple of Solomon. The whole world is being stirred by a startling movement of the Jews toward their homeland. Ten years ago there were only 1,000 Jews in. tne c.ty of Jerusalem; there are now 100,000. More than 200,000 Jews are found in the colonies recently established in Palestine. These are proving success-lul; good crops are being raised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than $20,000,000 is being invested in railroads. With.n the next few months Jerusalem will have become </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">city of electricity; rails are being laid for electric cars. The Jews have $5,000,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in a </span><span class="font4">Jerusalem bank. They </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have pur</span><span class="font4">chased a large amount of land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Until forty years ago the land of Palestine was arid. There were few inhabitants. There is a prophecy which reads, “In the last days I will pour out upon you again the latter rains.” Ram has come in abundance in tiie last few years; Palestine again blossoms; 10,000 olive trees have been planted in Samaria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is believed that Jerusalem will become as of old the market-place of the Orient, and that Palestine will again “flow with milk and honey.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Philadelphia Evening Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;SEA AND WAVES ROARING.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“One of the greatest demonstrations in the history of organized labor was held recently in Hyde Park, London. Fifty thousuand sympathizers rallied in support of the nine labor leaders deported from Africa, while the merely curious swelled the crowd to more than 106,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It was a scene of the utmost picturesqueness and impressiveness as, with splendid teamwork, the deported nine rose simultaneously on their respective platforms and a thousand brightly colored banners were raised aloft and shaken, as if in defiance of Botha and the South African Government, while the huge assemblage sang ‘The Red Flag’ and gave the exiles a tremendous welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Commenting upon the Hyde Park demonstration, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Neivs</span><span class="font4"> says: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘It </span><span class="font4">is certain that none of the political parties has any idea of the magnitude of the storm brewing. This is not an ordinary labor agitation. What the man in the crowd feels, perhaps, rather than thinks or says, is that in their dealings with the deported nine Gen. Smuts and his colleagues struck a blow, not </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font4">trades unionism only, but </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">.at the very </span><span class="font4">heart of civilized democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ ‘The popular instinct is right, as it is apt to be on these matters of life and death.

<p><span class="font4">Charmed with the prospect, these are not daunted by the trials and difficulties of the way, especially when they hear the Redeemer’s Word encouraging them, saying, “Fear not, I have overcome the</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Thus encouraged, these believers make </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">full consecration of themselves to God and His service, realizing and confessing their own imperfection and insufficiency, and pledging themselves to fight a good fight against sin in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font4"> form under the captaincy of Jesus.

<p><span class="font11">WHY JESUS DIED FOR SINNERS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font8">W</span><span class="font4">EILE the Bible everywhere declares the importance of the death of Jesus, Christian people in recent times seem to be perplexed upon the subject. Some dispute the Bible statement of the necessity for Jesus’ death, and claim that His life was no different from that of other men, and His death was no different from that of others. Some claim that Jesus came into the world, and passed through various trying experiences, not in order to redeem mankind from anything, but in order to show His followers how they should live and die for a good cause. Others in bewilderment declare that they see no relationship between Jesus’ death and what they have been taught is the penalty for sin; namely, eternal torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In general, there is confusion upon the subject, and only those who get the proper Scriptural focus on the question of why •Christ died can be mentally at rest, and able to enter sympathetically into the various features of the great Plan of God, of which the death of Jesus for human redemption is a part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We protest against the too common, practise of accepting a portion of the Bible, and rejecting the remainder. Any<sup>1 </sup>man wise enough to criticise the inspired Word should be accepted as an inspired authority capable of writing a better istatement of the Divine Plan. For our part, we believe that the Holy Scriptures, as St. Paul declares, were written aforetime by holy men for the admonition of the Church. We believe that this was</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">done because God wished His people to understand His Divine purposes and arrangements, and sympathetically to enjoy ■them and co-operate in their fulfilment. We should hold fast “the faith once delivered to the saints,” and should not ■allow our own wisdom or the wisdom of ■other men to make the Word of God of pone effect. We remind our readers how Jesus reproved the Pharisees for neglect of God’s Word and for taking instead of it the traditions of men.—Mark 7 :6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, our English Bible does not profess to be the Word of God, but merely a translation of it. If, therefore, we find some passages of Scripture which h:ive been mistranslated, and thus misrepresent the original Scriptures, we should make haste to correct these, and to admit that the translations were not in</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">spired. Additionally, we remind that all old manuscripts show that during the long period of eighteen centuries errors crept in—additions to the words of Jesus and the Apostles. At the time of the preparation of our Common Version English Bible the number- of Greek manuscripts was only seven, whereas now there are several hundreds. Three of them in</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Every battle against sin is a good </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fight </span><span class="font4">—whether it be tne battling of t-he world during the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Times of </span><span class="font4">Restitution </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font4">the battling of the Church during this Age. But because </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font4">designs to give the Church a higher nature, a greater salvation, therefore He requires of every member of it a special demonstration of love and loyalty. And who will say that this is not a reasonable requirement of these <sup>p</sup> sons ?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4">These spirit-begotten sons are all alike in the sense that they have one mind, one spirit, one disposition—the Spirit of Christ, the spirit of holiness, the spirit of loyalty to God. But these are all distinctly different as respects their flesh. All are imperfect, but some more and some less so. Some are more and some less educated; some more and some less wise ; some more and some less talented. But the tests are all under Divine supervision. The Lord sees to it that each shall be thoroughly tested. Each must have trials, difficulties, besetments, from the world, the Adversary and his own flesh. Each must personally demonstrate his loyalty to the principles for which Christ died—the principles of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chief lessons for all of 'these sons </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">God to learn are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1) Faith in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God—full trust in Him </span><span class="font4">and His providences.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(2)</span><span class="font4"> Loyalty to Him—to the principles of Elis Government, and to all those whom He has accepted as sons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(3) They must all possess in large degree God’s own Spirit of love, kindness, gentleness and mercy, as well as of the Truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">They will not, however, be judged holy according to the flesh. Rather, judgment, or decision, in their cases will be rendered according to the spirit, the intention, the will. They will be rewarded for what they have endeavored to do and have striven to do in harmony with the Divine will rather than according to the success they have attained.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There is no dispute among the various orthodox creeds that there was a penalty against mankind which needed to be met, before the Divine blessing could come to any of our race. These creeds all agree that Adam, the father of the race, was created perfect, in the image, in the moral likeness, of his Maker, but that he sinned, and came under a penalty, or ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">curse, on account of sin. Hence all of <sub>F</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A^<sup>ge</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<sup>g(</sup>peral work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">•his race, inheriting life from him, shared </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">^t </span><span class="font4">his weaknesses and his condemnation </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font4">death.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">God, having sentenced man to death as unworthy of life, could not consistently have any dealings with him, while still condemned. Hence God’s provision that Jesus as the Son of God should recover Adam and his race from the sentence of death—in order that all might have an opportunity to return to harmony with •God, and thus to everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is clearly set forth in both the Old Testament and the New. If we would forget our creeds and rid our minds of the false theories which they inculcate, these Scriptures would now guide us without difficulty. Christendom is handicapped by the creeds of the Dark Ages, which confuse us. On this subject, for instance, of Christ’s redeeming work, we are met with the proposition of the creeds that the curse of God against our race is eternal torture in some far-off place, we know not where—possibly within the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘The misconceptions of our forefathers on the subject of punishment for sin were built upon mistranslations or statements meant </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to be</span><span class="font4"> understod symbolically. For instance, we read of our Lord, “He opened His mouth in parables and dark sayings.” When our Lord illustrated the •utter destruction of the finally incorrigible by the destruction of the offal of Jerusalem, cast into the Gehenna fire outside of the city wall, it was not torment that He taught, but annihilation. Nothing was tormented in the fire of the valley of Hinnom. In the Book of Revelation, wholly symbolical, the plain statement is made that the lake of fire represents the Second Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Wages of Sin Is Death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most emphatically the Bible declares the wages of sin to be death—not tor-once that the death of the soul is meant. “The soul that sinneth it shall die.” “God is able to destroy both soul and body” in Gehenna, the Second Death. The penalty against Adam, “Dying, thou Shalt die,” signifies the death of his soul, ins entire being. Under that sentence, unless redeemed, Adam and his race would have no future life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But God from the very beginning purposed to redeem man from this death sentence. In due time He sent forth His Son to pay man’s redemption price. Jesus’ redemptive work will restore man’s soul from the power of the tomb, by a resurrection of the dead. Therefore, even before Jesus had died for our sins, He said, to some of the people, “Fear not them which can kill the body,” and thus take from you all that remains of the present Adamic life. Fear God, with whom are the issues of the future life, for Ele is able to destroy not merely the temporary life of the present time, but also your prospective life, which He purposes to secure for you through the Redeemer's sacrifice, and by the resurrection from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We se(\ then, that God rested every feature of Elis Plan for mankind upon the great work which from the beginning He intended Jesus should accomplish for our race. St. Paul expresses this in a few words, saying, “As by a man came death [not eternal torment], by a man also comes the resurrection of the dead. •For as all in Adam die, even so all in Christ shall be made alive, every man in his own order.” The first order, or resurrection, is that of The Christ, Head and Body, to glory, honor, immortality, on the Divine plane of being. Search carefully' the Old Testament Scriptures— ■every word of God through Moses and the 'Prophets—and we find not a hint of any other penalty for sin than this death penalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What the Death Penalty Includes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many fail to grasp the full import of the death penalty. It includes not only the final act of dying, but all the steps leading thereto. Had there been </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no sin </span><span class="font4">and no sin penalty, there would have been </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font4">dying process—no aches, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font4">pain, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font4">sighing nor crying, nor dying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Man lived in Eden as happily as angels live in their Heavenly home on the spirit plane, for he is an earthly being, adapted only to earthly conditions. Besides, had it not been for sin, God would not have permitted the curse, nor brought thorns, thistles, storms, cyclones, drouth and deluges, which in death-dealing power have been permitted to come to man, because he is a convict. He is already under sentence of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The favors that God has promised </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">him through Christ will come in their due season. They will make earth </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">•Paradise Garden, with nothing to hurt </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font4">destroy. The Divine blessing will bring to all mankind the opportunity to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font4">turn to the image and likeness of God, iand to everlasting life, under the New Covenant.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Another of Our Difficulties.</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">An additional difficulty under </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font4">we labored as 'Bible students in the past is that we confused the special work of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">________xxvuo pivvioiuu, LRIUUgU</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">•the death of Christ, for rolling away the curse of sin and death from mankind </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ap</span><span class="font4">plies to the next Age, and not to the present Age. When His </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">due </span><span class="font4">time shall arrive, everything will be in readiness for the great work which He has promised shall be satisfactorily consummated. Divine Wisdom, backed by Divine Power, will establish Messiah’s Kingdom </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">power and great glory, bind Satan, break the shackles of ignorance, error and sin, and set humanity free from the slavery of sin and death, under which it has rested for six thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This great work is spoken </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of in two </span><span class="font4">different ways: (1) It will be a time for overthrowing and breaking down the powers of sin, darkness and evil. (2) It will be a time for uplifting mankind to the original Divine image in which Adam was created.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">As the entire reign of sin and death came, through A dam’s disobedience, upon the whole world, so the entire release from the curse will come to every member of the race, through Jesus. The broad basis for this work has already been laid in the death of Jesus. “Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures.” (1 Corinthians 15:3.) Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for every man. “He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours qnly, but also for the sins of the whole world.”—1 John </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2 : </span><span class="font4">2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As all the race were involved in the death sentence, the one redemptive work was necessary for the releasing of all. In God’s arrangement He has divided the redeemed into two great classes, both •of which will attain everlasting life. _ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font4">•one class will receive it </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">on the</span><span class="font4"> spiritual, or Heavenly, plane, while the other will get it on the earthly plane. This does not signify universalism, for while these two classes are to be saved, the Bible distinctly tells of some who will receive the grace of God in vain, and die the Second Death.—'Revelation 21 :8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From this viewpoint, note the force of the Apostle’s words: “The wages of sin</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4">ig death, but </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the gift of God is eternal </span><span class="font4">life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23.) The death sentence passed upon all through one man, Adam. The gift of God is to come to all humanity through the second Adam, the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Riches of God’s Grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Great Creator is rich in grace, the Apostle tells us. Ue not only purposed to recover mankind from the disadvantages of the fall, but additionally took advantage of the circumstances connected with the permission of sin to give an especial opportunity to any of the sinners to manifest, if they would, special loyalty to Himself. God might have placed a different penalty against sin. He might have excluded our first parents from Eden for a year and then have returned them, or He might have simply banished the race from Eden, and have</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Matthew 13:18.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">T'UE WORDS “hear ye” in our text * have the sense of “understand ye.” The disciples, along with the multitude, had already heard the Parable of the Sower who sowed good seed only, some </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">which fell by the wayside and was devoured by the fowl; some fell on stony ground and was thrifty for a time, but ■was soon scorched by the sun because of .insufficiency of depth of earth ; some fell on good, rich ground that was infested by thorns, which choked it, and some fell </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font4">good ground and brought forth variously, some thirty and some sixty and some a hundred fold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The disciples wondered why the Lord spoke in parables, which neither they nor the multitude understood, and on this occasion they asked, specially, why this was so, and also to be given an explanation of the parble. Our Lord pointed out that in thus doing He was fulfilling prophecy, and for a purpose. The purpose was that those in the right condition of heart who would earnestly seek might receive the instruction, while others, indifferent, careless, would be left in ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This method would best serve the Divine Plan, which would be beneficial only to those in the right attitude of heart and might be misused of others, and thus the Divine purposes be interfered with. For instance, if the masses of the Jews had heard, understood, comprehended, our Lord’s teachings, “they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory,” as St. Peter declares ; and since it was a part of the Divine Purpose that our Lord should be crucified, it was expedient that the masses and their rulers should be left in ignorance and that only those whom the Lord is specially calling should be able to understand His teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The same principle holds good today. As the Apostle explains : “The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” But as our Lord was willing to explain His parables to Hi consecrated followers so that they might be informed and strengthened and guided by the Wisdom from on high, so the Apostle informs us it is today—that the Spirit-begotten ones of the Lord’s people may, can, must understand the deep things of God to be properly instructed and “thoroughly furnished unto every good word and work.” —2 Timothy 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hence, as our Lord said to the disciples, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to all the outsiders these things are spoken in parables and dark sayings, that, seeing, they see not and, hearing, they hear not, neither do they understand.” Similarly the Apostle declares that the natural man, not begotten of the Spirit, cannot know of tlie deep things of God, yet the “little flock” of spirit-begotten ones may know, will know. He declares: “But God has revealed these things unto us by His Spirit, which searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.”—1 Cor. 2 :10, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Word of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Explaining the parable our Lord declares : “When anyone heareth the vVord of the Kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the wayside.” Several items here demand attention. First of all, the kind of seed. Next, tlmt was expressly stated that it was “the Word of the Kingdom,” the Gospel of the Kingdom. Apparently very few Christian people have much knowledge of the Kingdom. They have not received the Word of the Kingdom properly. Instead, they receive through the traditions of men the word of eternal torment, the message that nearly all mankind are bound for eternal woe or for a purgatorial experience, which only a very few might hope to escape—the saintly. We should note well that nearly all of the Lord’s parables and leachings related to the Kingdom, for which He taught us to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">allowed all to live without sentence of </span><span class="font4">death against us. Had He done so, Jesus would net have needed to die for man’s redemption. Because the sentence of death had been imposed, however, it must be canceled before the race could be restored to perfection and to God’s favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is evident, then, that God wished to have the death penalty upon our race, so. as to make necessary the death of His Son. This, in turn, meant that the Father invited the Son to become man’s Redeemer, and that the Son accepted the offer, and came into this world for that very purpose. This implied that the Father would reward Him with a high exaltation, in recognition of His loyalty and obedience unto death, even the death of the cross. Thus Jesus suffered for our sins, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">entered into His </span><span class="font4">glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">pray, “Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When He sent forth His disciples into every city it was with the Message, “The Kingdom of God is at hand.” When the Jews failed to receive Him, He informed them that they were rejecting the Kingdom of God, as had been foretold by the Prophets. And He told them that “the Kingdom should be taken from them and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.” (Matthew 21:43.) We remember the particular day when the Kingdom was taken from them—just five days before our Lord’s crucifixion, when, riding upon the ass, He declared, “O, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would 1 have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye w’ould not.” (Matthew 23:37.) This was the house of Moses, the house of servants. Our Lord gave them the first opportunity to become the sons of God and to be associates with Himself as the Great King, to sit with Him in His Throne and to exercise the foretold Millennial Kingdom-powers for the blessing of all the families of the earth.—Revelation 3 :21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But they were not worthy as a whole, and hence were rejected as a nation and ceased to be God’s special people for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">time. Nevertheless, among them were found a “little flock” of “Israelites indeed,” who were accepted as the nucleus of the Kingdom class. To this nucleus the Lord has been adJng, throughout this Gospel Age, “elect” ones out of all nations ■—chosen and accepted because of their faith, love and obedience. With the completion of this election the present </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Age </span><span class="font4">will end and the Church of Christ, which has suffered with the Master throughout this Age, will be glorified with Him in the First Resurrection. Then the Kingdom class will be complete and be granted real power and authority for the ruling, blessing and uplifting of mankind out of present degradation, sin and death—by restitution bringing the willing and obedient back to the likeness or God, in which Father Adam was created, and utterly destroying the disobedient in 'the Second Death.—Acts 3 :23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The word of the Kingdom, therefore, is the Message which has been going forth since our Lord’s First Advent—the information that God has appointed Christ to be the Great King to bless and restore the world and that He is now seeking a “little flock” to be His associates in that work, otherwise sometimes called the “Bride,” the “Lamb’s Wife”—at other times styled “the Royal Priesthood.” This Word or Message has not been generally proclaimed throughout the world until the nineteenth century. For a long time it was mainly confined to the few nations contiguous to Palestine, where the light of the Gospel first went forth. But the Lord purposed that it should be presented to all nations in order that all might be represented in this Kingdom class still being selected. Hence, during the past century He not only awakened a missionary spirit among His people to carry the Ales-sage everywhere, but He provided printing presses and Bible societies and railroads and steamships and mail services that now the Gospel message should be carried to all people. And thus it has peached every nation. It has not converted the nations; it was not so intended. The purpose was to gather out of them a “Little Flock” to be joint-heirs with Christ in the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Wayside Hearer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Alas I the wayside hearer represents the vast majority of our race who have no ear to hear the Glorious Alessage as it is now going forth. We blame them not. The Lord blames themmot. It was not their fault, perhaps, that their minds were so downtrodden with ignorance and superstition that the Message of the Kingdom could find no lodgment in their hearts and in their minds. Hearing with the outward ear, the Truth is incomprehensible to them. They were under the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">Adversary’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">power, too, and </span><span class="font4">he </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">soon </span><span class="font4">caused them to forget what they had heard but not understood. This is his constant policy ; as the Apostle declares, “The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 </span><span class="font4">Corinthians 4:4.) Their minds are closed to the Message that is now going forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thank God I They are not to be sent to eternal torment because they </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have been </span><span class="font4">thus blinded of the Adversary and unable to receive the Message now promulgated. Praise be to God that after the present Alessage shall have served its purpose in gathering the “elect” for the Kingdom, Satan snail be bound to deceive the poor world no more and the Alessage of God’s grace in Christ will be known to every creature! The Divine assurance </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is that </span><span class="font4">then all the olind eyes shall be opened and all the deaf ears unstopped.” And “.the knowledge of the Lord shall cover </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">earth as the waters cover the great deep.” And “there will be no need to say to our neighbor, Know thou the Lord, For all shall know Him, from the least to the greatest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Stony Ground Hearers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are well-meaning people, “good people,” who are very shallow—well-intentioned, but they have not deep, strong characters. When God’s Truth reaches these they can appreciate it and they receive it with joy and start in the good way with zeal, but they are not the kind that the Lord wants in this special election. He will want them and all during the Millennial Age, but now He is seeking a special class for which these are not fit. Their unfitness is shown by the fact that they are not producing the fruits </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the Spirit. Persecution withers them. They are not strong characters. They will be passed by as non-elect; but, thank God, they will not be tortured, but reserved for the Alessianic Reign, when the influences of the Kingdom will be quite sufficient to deal with their case and to give them strength of character and to take away the unfavorable, stony condition which now hinders fruitage!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Good Seed in Thorny Ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It requires good soil to produce thorns, but when the good seed was sown upon that soil and both sprang up together, the thorns choked the wheat. It sapped the nourishment of the soil to itself and the wheat was choked. Perhaps all of us have heard these thorns compared to the attractions of the theater, the gaming table, sports, novels, etc.—that these as thorns beset the Christian way and tend to choke the development of the fruits of the Spirit. But is this the proper interpretation? Is it true that the danger of the Christian lies along these lines? It seems to us that there are nominal Christians who might be beset by such matters, but that the higher thought is that the true Christian, begotten of the Holy Spirit, is out of sympathy with such things and that they have no place in his heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the Apostle declares of such: “Old things are passed away ; behold, all things are become new,” and “The things that I once hated I now love, and the things that I once loved I now hate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">brother in the Lord, who but recently made a full consecration of himself, remarked to us recently: “It seems so strange, Brother Russell, the wonderful change that has come over my life. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">year ago I was wildly excited over baseball. It occupied much of my thought, and I always attended the games when possible. This year it has no attraction for me whatever. Instead, God’s wonderful Plan of Salvation captivates my thought, and every spare hour that I can command I wish to be studying it or fellowsnipping with those of like precious faith. Truly with me old things have passed away; all things have become new 1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hearkening to our Lord’s explanation we notice that it is in agreement with this thought, that the thorns are not wicked practices, but “cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches.” Ah, yes! the true Christian whose heart has been renewed by the gracious promises of God’s AVord and the hopes of a share in the Kingdom with his Lord is in danger of being swamped by the ordinary duties of life, proper enough in themselves to a limited degree. The Tord’s Word commands him to be not slothful in business</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">and to make provision for those of his own household, but he is in constant danger of allowing these things to crowd his spiritual interests as a New Creature. Instead of curtailing earthly desires, ambitions, business and family responsibilities, minimizing these that he may </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font4">the more time or money, or both, to expend in the Divine service, he is apt to allow the matter to go the other way, to give too great heed to these things </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">to provide more than “things needful and decent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pride, ambition for self and for family, love of money and tne pursuit of it, and the award which this pursuit brings and the hindrances to spiritual growth and to fruitage in the Lord’s service—these are the “thorns.” Alas, many of God’s true saints are thus injured! These will not be fit for the Kingdom. They will miss the great Prize. They will suffer </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">great loss, whatever may be the blessings and whatever they may attain to in God’s providence by coming up through </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font4">tribulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The thorny ground, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">course, cannot cast out its own thorns, and herein the parable is defective. The Lord’s explanation shows this, and all Christians are exhorted of the Lord to keep themselves in the love of God, to cast out thorny influences and to bring forth much fruit. If, then, we find that our hearts are infested with the cares of this life and with the pursuit of earthly riches let us at once cast out these thorns that our hearts may bring forth the fruitage in harmony with the intimation of our Master to bring forth the good fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Thirty, Sixty and a Hundred Fold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some good-ground hearers will be found. God foreknew this and hence prepared this Gospel Age and all of its sowing for the sake of these wno bring forth good results. Ours will be a blessed condition if we shall have but thirty fold; still more blessed if we bring forth sixty fold; and yet more blessed if the results shall be a hundred fold. While the soil cannot change itself, yet we as New Creatures have the determining of the condition of the soil of our own hearts. The more fully we are submitted to the Divine Will, the more fully we are dead to self and the world, the more abundant will be the crop, the fruitage, which we shall yield to the Alaster’s sowing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It should be our ambition every day to attain to that condition of fullest harmony with our Lord which will yield the hundred fold results in us, in return for the exceeding great ana precious promises which constitute the Seed. Not alone will the Alaster be best pleased with the largest fruitage, but we ourselves will be most pleased with this result, both in the present time and in the future. The more fully, the more heartily we surrender ourselves to the influences of the good seed of toe Kingdom, the more we allow these Divine promises to work in us to will and to do the heavenly Father's good pleasure, the greater will be dur own satisfaction and joy, both now and by and by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Apostle speaks of differences in the future glory of the Church, saying, “As star differeth from star in glory, so also will be the Resurrection of the ■Church.” All of the faithful ones will receive a blessing and hear the Alaster’s “Well done, good and faithful servant! Enter into the joy of your Lord.” Nevertheless those who have been most earnest, most zealous, most devoted, and who yield a hundred fold, according to this parable, will shine the most brightly 'In the Kingdom, will be the nearest to the Alaster in His throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A similar thought is suggested by our Lord in the Parable of the Pounds; for while all who used their pounds faithfully were welcomed as good and faithful servants and entered into the joys of their Lord, nevertheless the one who had gained the ten pounds got the greatest blessing, as expressed in our Lord’s words, “Have dominion over ten cities.” So then, dear friends, let us realize that every word, every act, every thought, has to do with our present and our future nearness to the Lord. Let us cast out the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches, and let us overcome the spirit of the world, the spirit of indifference, and let us be so enthused with the Gospel of the Kingdom that we shall bring forth much fruit. “Herein is your Father glorified.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is t ie image of God, should shine unto them.”—2 </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Corinthians 4:3, 4.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">E do not </span><span class="font4">charge our forefathers with evil intent in the making of the creeds. We cheerfully admit that every creed contains an element of Divine Truth. Our contention is that Satan, the great Adversary of God, substituted </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">creeds for the Bible; and into the creeds, through human weakness, he injected a sufficiency of nonsense and “doctrines of devils” to render them unhealthful for the saints, and absolutely poisonous to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The truthfulness of our text is manifest on every hand. The word Gospel signifies the good Message, it was the Message of the angels at the birth of Jesus: &quot;Behold, we bring you (the Gospel) good tidings of great joy, which shall be unto all people 1” This Gospel of joy and blessing, of Divine Love and Mercy toward our race, is completely hidden from the world. Even matured Christians discern but little of it, because the creeds of human tradition have so misrepresented God and His purposes as to make of them bad tidings—not good tidings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Hath Blinded Their Minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">St. Paul, as well as the other Apostles, foretold the falling away of the Church from “the faith once delivered to the saints” ; and he particularly pointed out that this would be me result of giving heed to “seducing spirits” and “doctrines of demons”—the fallen angels. (1 Timothy 4:1; Jude 6.) In a thousand ways, through mediums, planchettes, visions and dreams, etc., these fallen, seducing spirits have intruded their demon doctrines upon the Church of Christ. And the whole purport of tneir evil work seems to be to deceive mankind in respect to God’s real purposes toward them, and His real character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How wonderfully successful Satan </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">his fallen ange's, the demons, have been I While persuading men that they were far </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">off, </span><span class="font4">stoking fires for humanity’s future torture, they have really been hobnobbing with ecclesiastics and assisting in misrepresentation of the Bible—</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">espe</span><span class="font4">cially its parables and symbolic statements. To such an extent is this true that the glory of God manifested in Jesus </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font4">human salvation is completely con</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fused </span><span class="font4">and unintelligible to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Unbelievers can reason, and do reason. Those who reside in civilized lands, instructed along the lines of the creeds, inquire, Why did God make us sinners, with depraved appetites and sentence us </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">eternal torment, and then send Jesus </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">be the Savior of merely such as be</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">come </span><span class="font4">saints, believers in certain doctrines which they themselves call mysterious? Intelligent heathens similarly ask, Why should God. make such a plan as the missionaries relate? Why should He condemn us all to eternal torment and then make provision for only the few who hear of Jesus, and believe the mysteries and monstrous inconsistencies of some of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the creeds?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do not the facts to-day, after eighteen centuries of creed-blinded Christianity, corroborate the Apostle’s statement that the “god of this world,” Satan, “hath blinded the minds of them that believe not?” Otherwise surely the glorious Gospel of Christ, now becoming more and more clear to Bible students, would long ago have shone into many hearts, carrying joy and peace through reconciliation with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The statement of our text, “If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost,” does not mean that they are lost because they cannot see the Gospel. The Bible distinctly tells us that all of Adam’s race are lost through disobedi</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ence. The </span><span class="font4">Apostle evidently means that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">masses of the lost world cannot see </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">Gospel light. It is hidden from them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We may well thank God that the time in which Satan will be thus privileged to put darkness for light to deceive the world is limited. The Bible prophesies that soon Christ will take His great power. His first work will be the binding of Satan that he may no longer deceive men. And then the Redeemer will begin His great work of blessing mankind, in the thousand years of His appointed reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What Prison Statistics Show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In all modern prisons statistics are kept which show the religious instruction received by the prisoners earlier in life. In almost every instance the prisoners guilty of the most serious offenses were from infancy trained to think of the Almighty as the great Enemy of His creatures, who foreknew and fore-arranged for the eternal torture of all but </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">handful. Did these creeds better those who confessed them? Did they inspire in the parents of these criminals heart-devotion to God? Nay, in almost every case where the false, horrible creed-idol was worshiped fear prevailed instead of love, bedlam instead of holiness. Is not this the case even to-day in the majority </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">homes of so-called Christendom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Foolish Fears, Vain Imaginations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Little have we realized the toolishness </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">such reasoning. The influence of the creeds of the Dark Ages has been the very reverse of what has been expected of them. Jian naturally has a reverence for ood. This may be seen in the shape of his head by those who can read phren-ologically. It is seen also in the fact that in heathen lands worship is practised. The true knowledge of God would incline men io come to Him. The highest qualities of their being would find expression in worship, praise, adoration. With the enlightenment of the Bible man would indeed learn that all are sinners, that all come short of that glorious perfection which God originally created and which alone He can approve. Guided by Bible instruction, these would realize that “the wages of sin is death” not eternal torment.—Romans 3:10-12; 6:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The desire for life everlasting persists </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">every creature; and man’s attitude would have been to approach his Creator to ascertain if it would not be possible for nim to return to relationship with God and to regain the gift of life everlasting. Then would have come the answer that no fallen creature is able to recover himself, but that God hag provided through Jesus’ death a recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Savior Able to Save.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the repentant one would strive to live up to the Divine standards and find it impossible because of inherited imperfections, he would be drawn to the merciful Father in Heaven, to learn how to attain to the condition which his heart coveted. Then he would hear the answer through the Scriptures that while God has provided for the world in general </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a. </span><span class="font4">thousand years of Restitution, yet He is willing now to receive a few choice characters, on special terms. These must have their Master’s spirit, a love for righteousness and a hatred for iniquity, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">loyalty to God, ready to lay aown life and every other thing in His service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such would be inducted by faith into the elect Church, would be begotten of the Holy Spirit, to be trained by trials, difficulties, testings and polishings, and eventually, if faithful, be accorded </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">Change of nature from earthly to Heavenly, participation with Christ in His great work of blessing and restoring humanity during His thousand-year Reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Errors Effect the Opposite</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our wily foe, Satan, well knew all this, and has worked in opposition to it. By hiding from men the true Gospel light, he has driven them in dread away from their best Friend—-Almighty God. From infancy they hoped to escape eternal torture, but as the weaknesses of their fallen nature yielded to the temptations on every hand, they prayed forgiveness. As sins multiplied, doubts and fears gained control, and in dread of God and in fear of the unjust and unmerciful arrangements of 'the future taught them from infancy, they plunged headlong into sin, striving to forget God. Some were led to one excess, some to another— gambling, drunkenness, frivolity, pleasure seeking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One merchant told us </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">his </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">own ex</span><span class="font4">perience. He said, “My good Methodist wife told me I would surely go to hell. I replied, ‘Mary, I know it, I know it ■ And when I get there, there will be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font4">sinner who will deserve something.’ I held the ordinary view—that all except the saintly were sure to spend eternity in torture. That seemed to me most unjust—that the Almighty had taken advantage of His power to create us </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">under </span><span class="font4">unfavorable conditions, with the foreknowledge that we should spend eternity in torment. I concluded that one person at least should deserve some of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A lady of wealth and refinement told us that secretly she had always feared the future, believing implicitly the teachings of the creeds. She said, “I went into society deliberately, with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">view to drowning my thoughts on religious subjects.” She did not feel drawn to the God presented in the creeds. She merely granted Him His Bower and sought to forget Him ; yet all the while, as she herself said, she was unhappy. Her soul found no rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Both of these people have since found the true God—have come to know Him in His true character, as presented </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to us in </span><span class="font4">the Bible, when rightly understood. They are both happy, both zealous, seeking to lay down their lives in His service, and taking pleasure in everything which, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in His </span><span class="font4">providence, they are permitted to experience, knowing that “all things are working together fot good to those who love God, the called according to His purpose.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Morning Dawns, Arise, Arise!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thank God, the morning of Immanuel’s Day is dawning! It is bringing light upon every subject. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font4">chains of error and superstition, statecraft and priestcraft, are breaking. True, some may thus be led to extremes and, mistaken, revolt against all religions and all authority and all laws of God and man. That is but a natural mistake. The pendulum swings naturally to an opposite extreme and requires some little time </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">steady itself upon a true center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The proper thought for us all is the one which the Bible gives, namely, that our delusions and bondages, our superstitions and errors, although by men, were not of men. Satan has been our great Adversary. He it is against whom we are to feel the special indignation. Like ourselves, others of humanity were blinded. Illustrations of this blindness were frequent during the Dark Ages. Men and women, misunderstanding the character and the Plan of God, were just as sincere as ourselves when they sought to copy what they supposed to be the Creator’s methods by torturing each other, burning one another at the stake, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These mistakes were not made wholly by one denomination, even as the errors which led to these mistakes were not held merely by one denomination. Presbyterians were persecuted, and in turn persecuted others; so did Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists, Catholics, etc. Mistakes so common in the past are not to be blamed either agamst denominations or against individuals. In harmony with our text, we should charge them up to the god of this world”—Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Instead of feeling anger and hatred and charging others with having kept us in ignorance and superstition, let us rather rejoice together and give thanks to God that our chains at last are breaking. Let us remember Saul of Tarsus as an illustration of how a good man, misled of the Adversary, became a persecutor of the Church of Christ. As he was freely forgiven of God, and showed himself a loyal servant of the King of kings, so let us regard others of our day as equally loyal, and let us trust that</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Why There Is Diversity </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Amongst</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> God’s People.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou that thou didst not receive?”—</span><span class="font5">1 Corinthians 4:7.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TX71ILE </span><span class="font4">it is true that all men are ** born with inalienable rights and privileges, yet no man is born without sin. The Scriptures very properly declare that the race in Adam was sold under Sin six thousand years ago. In. this sense, therefore, w<sup>T</sup>e were not born </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">free,</span><span class="font4"> but slaves of Sin. Neither are we born </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">equal.</span><span class="font4"> No two persons are exactly alike in opportunity, talent and ability. God did not create some better and some worse—some more richly endowed and some less richly endowed. We are to take the Bible statement of the origin of humanity, and understand that God made Adam </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">perfect.</span><span class="font4"> All the imperfections which encumber the human race are the results of the dying process. Sin has made us all to differ from the original image and likeness of God; Satan brought about this difference through Mother Eve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In our text, however the Apostle Paul has in mind a New Creation in Jesus Christ, amongst whose members there is a difference. Some in the Church have many, others few talents; some have special talents, others ordinary talents. But Satan is not charged with having given the greater or lesser talents to these. The Apostle says that it is God Who has set the various members in the Body as it has pleased Him; and that both this setting, or apportioning, of the different members of the Body and the they will become equally faithful as they come under the influence of the great light from Heaven, now shining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Put Away, Therefore, All These.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">St. Paul urges us, as children of the light, to walk in the ligut. Jesus bids us to let our light so shine before others that we may thus gio'-ify the Father in Heaven. St. Peter says that we should show forth the praises of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. The light that is now shin</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font4">upon the pathway of God’s faithful people is not </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">new light. It is the same light which Jesus and the Apostles held forth and rejoiced in. For the time being, it has been lost, buried under the rubbish and superstition and error of eighteen centuries. Now, in God’s providence, these obstructions are being seen. We are coming out from under their influence into the sunlight, the true light, which shail yet lighten every man, as. God’s Word has promised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The question with each and all of us who now perceive the source of the darkness in winch we have been and tne source of the light into which we have come is, What shall we render unto the Lord for all His benefits? ilow shall we best show to our gracious Lord our appreciation of His gracious character, of His true Plan of Salvation? The Scriptures assure us that we can best show our love and loyalty by improving the opportunities winch the Lord affords us for witnessing for Him and His Truth, which represents Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our time, our talents, our privileges, our opportunities, are limited. At very most we can do but little. How earnest we should be to demonstrate to the Lord our love and appreciation! How faithful we should be to others in carrying them the light, even as we ourselves appreciate the channels which God used in bringing the blessings to us ! How w’ise we suould be, realizing that our opponent is Satan himself, and not being ignorant </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ox </span><span class="font4">his devices ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are not to show forth our own praises, for we have nothing praiseworthy. What have we that we have not received? We did not make the Divine Plan. We merely learned of it by the grace of God. In telling it to others, therefore, this fact should be remembered, that it is not ours, but His. As we compare the Divine Plan of Salvation presented in the Bible with all the different plans of salvation represented in the various creeds of Christendom, we see how wonderfully different it is from them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the light of our day all are ashamed of the things set forth by the great and the wise of centuries ago. he might indeed have reason to be proud if we had manufactured the Divine Plan of the Ages, if it were our conception. But no, it is of the Father and by the Son, and we are merely privileged to be ministers or servants of the Father, of the Son and of the Truth—honored servants, truly, but servants still.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And evidently, when the Master shall </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">say </span><span class="font4">to the faithful ones, “Well done, good and faithful servants,” He will add, “I will make you rulers over many things, because ye have been faithful over a few things.” More and more we realize that our talents, our opportunities of the present time, are few ami small. Only of God’s grace may they become worthy of anything, and only by His blessing may they be powerful to the pulling down of the strongholds of error and to the building up of His people in the Most Holy Faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">bringing forth of the different </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">degrees of </span><span class="font4">fruitage are manifestations of God's grace in their hearts. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus th&gt;ey </span><span class="font4">are made to differ from each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font4">matter of growth in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tie </span><span class="font4">Holy •Spirit is one that is dependent in large measure upon each one’s zeal to know, to do, the will of God. The Lord’s people are put into the School of Christ to learn of Him. Some learn more rap.dly than others. In proportion as they learn, they .have greater opportunities and blessings; all are granted a measure of the Holy Spirit. Those who are anxious to know the will of the Lord and to study it, grow the more rapidly, and thus have more of the Holy Spirit. Their progress is attributable especially to the favor of God, to his blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Apostle goes on to say of these. Ye are God’s workmanship; “it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.” The Lord’s people could not do this work themselves. The power that is working in them is of 'God. He is preparing a glorious Temple. He has provided who shall be the Chief •Corner Stone of this Temple, and who shall be the members of the Temple class. •In God’s nrovidence each of these responded to the call to be “a living stone.” The stones were first cut out of the dark quarry of sin, and now they are being shaped and prepared for places in the glorious building.</span></p>

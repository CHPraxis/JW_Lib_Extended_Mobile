<p><span class="font5">To the Editor of The Sun:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sir :■—Tn the editorial column of the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Evening Sun, December 7, appeared the following in reference to Mr. Roosevelt’s article on the Mexican question, published in the .New York Times: “I<sub>v</sub>t (Mr. Roosevelt’s article) is virtually an appeal to religious prejudice; * * * it is a demagogic attempt to array the members of a powerful and &lt;&nbsp;splendid Church against Mr. Wilson by a recital of Mexican atrocities that are calculated to shock and horrify all Catholics beyond expression.” Here The Sun pro-<sub>f</sub> tests against Mr. Roosevelt’s using either ' his influence or the public press for the supposed purpose of prejudicing Catholics against the Wilson administration by a recital of facts—real facts, known to all of us; and: yet in the very same issue of The (Sun it allows its columns to be used for the purpose of openly attacking and slandering the same “powerful and splendid Church” by a recital not of facts, but of ignorant and malicious misrepresentations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I refer &gt;&nbsp;to the article written by, a certain Pastor Russell, under the heafc ing, “Clergy Ordination IProved Fraudulent,” in which the aforesaid gentleman takes occasion to ridicule the Catholic Church (mentioning her by name), denouncing her doctrines, rites and ceremonies as “shackles of ignorance and superstition,” and accusing her clergy of instituting various ceremonies for purposes of graft. He goes still further and grossly misrepresents Catholic teaching, imputing to the Church doctrines which she has never held, and making the further insolent implication that the vast majority of her people are kept in ignorance of this teaching. An example of this is found in the following, quoted from his article:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Another step,”&lt;he says, “in the wrong direction, which thoroughly' separates the clergy from the laity, was the doctrine still held by the Church of Rome; namely, that the clergy alone constitute the Church, and that the common people are the children of the Church. Many Catholics are not aware of this fact, but think they are members of the Catholic Church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That this statement is without foundation and therefore absolutely false may be .seen from the 'following definition found in our Catechism, taught in our schools, and on all occasions preached from our pulpits. According to this definition, “The Church is the congregation of all those who profess the faith of Christ, partake of the same sacraments, and are governed by their lawful pastors under one visible head.” That this includes the laity as well as the clergy as members of the Church is self-evident; and it is the doctrine held by the Church at the present day, and held by' her throughout the two thousand years of her existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another misrepresentation of Catholic teaching is found in the following: “Catholics still hold,” he says, “that the Millennium, or Christ’s thousand-year reign, began with the year 800.” This statement is positively absurd; no Catholic believes it, nor has the Church ever taught it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, it is to just such false statements as these, many more of which may be found in the article in question, that we object. We are willing, indeed, to excuse his ignorance of Catholic doctrine—we could not expect more; but when he openly asserts that Catholics do not know the true teachings of their Church, and that they are, moreover, knowingly and willingly kept in the dark about the same, then he grossly insults </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on 2d page, 1st column.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Pastor Russell, speaking recently in the New York City Temple, West 'Sixty-third street near Broadway, caused a commotion in religious circles by his straightforward and Scriptural treatment of ordination. We here report the discourse as published in the various metropolitan dailies: He took for his text, “CRY ALOUD, spare not; show My people their transgression.” (Isaiah 5'8:1.) He prefaced his address with some remarks respecting the unpleasant duty implied in his text, declaring that .he would far rather speak only smooth, pleasant things to everybody and concerning everybody. The Pastor certainly has the happy faculty of stating pungent truths in sympathetic language well supported by kindly' tones. He speaks from the heart and carries conviction as respects his sincerity. He said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every unbiased student of the Bible surely will agree that our Redeemer and His disciples manifested great humility, in contrast with the clergy of our day and of centuries past. ’None of our Lord’s disciples were Reverends, Right Reverends, Most Reverends—none of them were clergymen. They knew nothing whatever about the distinction between clergy and laity which subsequently developed. Jesus indeed did receive the title of Lord, or Master, Teacher; but with great humility He pointed out that His teaching was not His own, that He spoke the Message of the Father. Similarly the Apostles glorified God, and declared themselves “men of like passions with yourselves.” Jesus taught His disciples that they should not be self-seeking., that they should not seek the honor which cometh from men, but only that which cometh down from Above. “One is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren,” was His way of forewarning us against the error which afterward divided the Lord’s people into clergy and laity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Shackles of Ignorance and Superstition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is but reasonable to assume that many Christian ministers have neither studied deeply nor thought carefully on this subject, but have merely followed the beaten path of their various denominations without inquiring for the Divine authority of their ordination, titles, and honors of men as titled ecclesiastics. But our sympathy should not hinder us from freeing our minds of the shackles of ignorance and superstition, nor hinder us from helping others into the liberty wherewith Christ makes free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The persecutions of the Second and Third Centuries undoubtedly tended to keep the Church humble and free from hypocrites, but the prosperity dating from the beginning of the Fourth Century had a 'bad effect. Many of the bishops, according to Church history, neglected to follow the example of Jesus and the Apostles, and became lords, dignitaries in the Church, seeking to impress the worldly, especially the rulers, with their importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the year 330 A. D., under the patronage of the Emperor Constantine, all Christians who acknowledged the Ni-cene Creed were not only protected but honored, the Emperor seeking to strengthen his political power thereby. By him the Bishop of Rome was granted special honor as a chief among the Bishops, this also suiting the Emperor’s plans of making Rome the center of both political and religious influence. In the century following the power of the BiShops was greatly increased by various false doctrines which gradually crept in. The doctrine of a fiery Hell of torture was one of these, followed later by a theory that members of the true Church would never be sent to it, but instead to Purgatory, the tortures of which would furnish them a second chance for purification and preparation for Heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergy gradually grasped more and more of power and money for services in this world and beyond. Every marriage not performed by them would not be valid. Those married otherwise would be living in sin. Tbe tneory bf infant damnation made the ministers additionally necessary to sprinkle the babies, to preserve them from eternal torture. Then followed classification of sins and the fixing of penalties and arranging for masses for the sooner deliverance of the culprit from Purgatory. Rites and ceremonies connected with the dead were also declared necessary. All of these served to bind the people to the clergy, and more and more separated them from the simplicity of the Gospel and the example of Jesus and the Apostles, to which we are seeking to return, but are fought at every step by ignorance and superstition within and without.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A Point Not Generally Known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Favored by conditions prevailing, the Bishop of Rome became more and more prominent, while the (Roman Empire gradually went to pieces. The Bishop of Rome took to himself the title Pon-tifex Maximus, which signifies “highest religious dignitary,” a title which pre</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">The Book of Revelation declares itself to be a book of symbols. The Woman of the text is the symbolical Woman of the Bible; namely, the professed Church of Christ. The context declares that the &quot;Woman herself (the Church Nominal) was drunken with her own success in overcoming the saintlier followers of Jesus; that she attained great outward splendor as the price of her unfaithfulness to the Redeemer—the price of her illicit intercourse with the kingdoms of earth—receiving their support in return for her recognition of them. At the viously had been held by the Caesars. Another step in the wrong direction, which thoroughly separated the clergy from the laity, was the doctrine still held by’ the Church of 'Rome; namely, that the clergy alone constitute the Church, and that the common people are the “children of the Church.” .Many Catholics are not aware of this fact, but think that they are members of the Catholic Church. They forget that while they are privileged to call, the unor-dained students by the title Brother,, all the ordained number must be recognized by them as Father.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year 800 A. D. found Pope Leo III. in great honor, and the Church flourishing and making higher claims than ever before; namely, that the Church became, at that time the Kingdom of God. Catholics still hold that the Millennium, or Christ’s thousand-year Reign, began that year. They claim that the Popes, each i»&gt; him. represent Christ.in_H.is.Throne.^ hence the declaration that the Popes are Christ’s Vicegerent—reigning instead of Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Pope represented Christ, the Cardinals as an order were brought in to represent the highest order of the Church in glory; then Archbishops, Bishops and the lower clergy, all separated from the people by a great gulf; the Clergy, the Elect of God, holding the power and the destinies of the laity in their control; the laity dependent upon the clergy for baptism, marriages, funerals, holy candles, holy water, consecrated burying-ground, and finally, an entrance into Purgatory instead of into eternal torment, with the ultimate hope of rescue to glory and with assistances by the way obtainable through the office of the Mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am discussing the Church of Rome only, because for a time there was no other. Indeed, for a time it was dangerous to even suggest another.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rev. Thos. J. Lennan, St. Andrew’s Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pastor Russell Replies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn, Dec. 18, 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the Editor of The Sun, Baltimore, Md.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dear Sir :—I have before me what purports to be a copy of a letter addressed to you by Rev. Thos. J. Lennan, in which the gentleman takes exception to some statements made by me in an address published under the title, “Clergy Ordination Proved Fraudulent.” The reverend gentleman erred in supposing that my a-ddress was against the Roman Catholic Church—or against any church. I am not identified with any ecclesiastical system. The address was not delivered to Roman Catholics nor against Roman Catholicism. I merely mentioned some Roman Catholic doctrines incidentally. Roman Catholics inform me that they are not allowed to read any Sermons in the newspapers or elsewhere unless under special privilege from their clerics. Hence the printing of my sermon was not supposed to reach Catholics—except the clerics or those of the laity whom they think sufficiently intelligent to be granted full liberties. My addresses appeal to the great unchurched Anajofity OT”“manki‘nu' who are’ rapidly falling into unbelief—and many of them into atheism. These, classed as renegades by the Churches, are heeding my message and encourage me with assurances that they are finding foundations for faith very different from those which they abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am surprised that Rev. Lennan denies or takes any exception to my statements that the clergy alone constitute the Church of Rome and that the laity are merely the children of the Church. Surely the gentleman knows of the wide gulf which separates the clergy from the laity. Surely he knowfc that the laity are all taught to speak of the clergy as the “Fathers.” A young man being educated for the priesthood is styled a “Brother” up to the time he takes ordination—holy orders. 'By that ordination he steps over from the laity to the clergy. Instead, then, of being a “’Brother” to the laity, he at once becomes a “Father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does Rev. Lennan dispute that only the Church, only the ecclesiastics partake of the two elements of the communion and that to the laity is given the bread alone?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does Rev. Lennan dispute the very meaning of the word clergy—that it signifies heritage and that the clergy are said to be thus separated from all others, as God’s heritage—God’s Church? I am well aware that Protestants, while ignoring the teachings of the Roman hierarchy entirely, accept nominally the division between clergy and laity. This, however, on their part, seems to be from lack of information because the Protestant sects, especially those which recognize the congregational system, such as Baptists, Congregationalists, etc., all who in any manner elect their clergy, recognize the electors as the Church and the clergy as their honored servants. These all claim to be in harmony with St. Peter’s statement to the effect that the entire Church of Christ is a Royal Priesthood, a peculiar people, God’s holy nation. (1 Peter 2:9.) It is the same St. Peter who uses the word clergy. (1 Peter 5:3.) See Douay Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely Rev. Lennan will not dispute that himself and others of the Catholic clergy are ecclesiastics and just as surely he will </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> claim that the laity are ecclesiastics 1 But what is the real meaning of this word? It comes from the Greek word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ecclesia</span><span class="font5"> and signifies the Church. In other words, all ecclesiastics claim to be the Church and disallow that the laity are ecclesiastics or members of the Church. We hold that the entire</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New Testament teaches that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ecclesia</span><span class="font5"> of Christ is the Church of Christ, the Body of Christ, the members of that mystical Body of which Christ is the Head. We hold that these are a Royal Priesthood, fully commissioned and fully ordained to preach &quot;all things written.” We hold that we of today have inherited from the past a misconception, a fraudulent view in respect to ordination to preach, in the claim that this is not equally for all who are joined to Christ by faith through consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'Never did I think that any Roman Catholic, especially a cleric, an ecclesiastic, would deny my statements that it is Catholic doctrine that the Millennium began with the year 800 under Pope Leo III., and that it ended A. D. 1799, when the Pope was taken a prisoner to Paris by Napoleon! The Roman Catholic view, furthermore, is that the “little season” of Revelation 20:3, 7 is the period since 1799 and that the progress of Protestantism is the figuratively declared loosing of Satan for a little season. In old editions of the Douay Bible this explanation is given in the footnote comments on this passage. In some of the more recent editions the footnote has been changed, ‘but still applies the thousand years of Revelation 20:2 in the past. It reads thus: “For a thousand years; that is, for the whole time of the New Testament; but specially from the time of the destruction of Babylon or Pagan Rome, till the new efforts of Gog and Magog against the Church, towards the end of the world.” Where Pagan Rome ended Papal Rome began. This, according to history, /was in 756. Whichever of these Catholic comments be accepted places the thousand years of Christ’s reign—the Millennium—in the past. I think it would be unwise for Rev. Lennan to attempt to dispute either of these points which he raises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, I remind you, Sir, that I am addressing the public—not Roman Catholics. I am discussing Truth and Error. I seek to use, always, courteous language. I strictly avoid personalities. I preach the Gospel to the best of my ability, and the public manifest a desire to hear. Surely Rev. Lennan and all the various religious systems,_ after centuries of propagation' and inculcation, should be willing to hear the other side without fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Respectfully yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">C. T. Russell.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>CLERGY ORDINATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PROVED FRAUDULENT </span><span class="font5">resenting the Almighty, instructed the people who should be their kings and princes; and. as a matter of. course, they were instructed - to be obedient only to such as recognized the papal power, and they were absolved from obedience to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus the separation amongst Christ’s followers—of clergy and laity—was established for centuries before the Protestant denominations of today were born. It was but natural that the Protestants should more or less copy the practises and many of the doctrines with which they had been familiar from childhood. The Greek, Armenian and Anglican Churches copied very closely the (Mother. They still preserve the likeness in many respects, even though they came out of her as Protest-ants and have sought to return to the Bible teachings and methods. But power and ceremony are difficult matters to get rid of. In consequence we see everywhere forms of godliness without seeing much manifestation of its power. We see much lip reverence without much manifestation of the Spirit of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Protestants and Christ’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Protestants are much confused respecting the papal claim that Christ’s Kingdom has been set up. They, of course, deny that the Popes are Christ’s vicegerent. Nevertheless, they have followed Papacy’s lead in telling earthly kingdoms and rulers that they are part and parcel of Christ’s Kingdom—“Christendom.” They send their chaplains with the armies and navies of these kingdoms. They receive financial support and recognition from them, and call upon the civil power to suppress so-called heretics, refuse them license to preach, etc. Thus they follow closely in the footsteps of their Mother. Altogether these false doctrines are surely responsible, not only for many of the wars of the past, but also for the present European war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We may assume that some of the clergy, Catholic and Protestant, are thoroughly confused and honestly doing what they believe to be the Lord’s will in these matters. But, on the other hand, we are •bound to assume that in the light of our day there are thousands of clergymen who are not deceived—who know full well that the world is ruled, not by Christ and His teachings, but by self-seeking kings, princes, nobles, financiers, politicians, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But knowing, these things, seeing the people in ignorance, what have the ministers of so-called “Christendom” done to open the eyes of the people to the truth on this subject—to tell them that these kingdoms are not Christ’s kingdoms in any sehse of the word? How few of them ever even refer to the Second Coming of the Redeemer! How few of them have ever pointed their people to St. Peter’s words respecting the glorious Times of Restitution which Messiah’s Kingdom will usher in: “Repent ye, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you, whom the Heavens must retain until the Times of Restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy Prophets since the world began.”—Acts' 3 :19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Policy, self-seeking, lack of candor, are certainly manifest in the course of the clergymen of all denominations. Now as the hour of their judgment approaches they deserve our sympathy. They have held on so long to the errors of the past that they are ashamed now to turn about and make confession. Many of them think that the safer course is to “bluff” the people. But it will not do. The light is shining too brightly for that. Knowledge is increasing every moment. Many in the pews are as well educated as the occupant of the pulpit, and decline to be any longer fed on chaff and wind. Hence the complained-of decline in church attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dignified False Pretense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In an endeavor to intimidate their people, to hinder them from hearing me and from reading my books entitled “Studies in the Scriptures,” the clergymen are going to absurd lengths. They have tried all kinds of slander and vilification, but still the common people are hearing gladly in all parts of. the world the Message of the Bible—its anticlerical Message. The clergy publish me as a heretic, only to find that the most thoughtful and intelligent of their people realize that their creeds are unsatisfactory and are the more anxious to know what I have to tell them respecting the Bible Message of God’s Wisdom, Justice, Love and Power, operating through Jesus now for the blessing of the Church, and during the Millennium for the blessing of the remainder of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let me make plain the subject of ministerial ordination. Each sect ordains (that is, authorizes) its own preachers. A clergyman passing from one denomination to another is, therefore, properly reordained. In a word, ordination is a human authority to be a clergyman for the ordaining sect. Certain vows of ordination are required before the ordination service takes place. The vow is that they will preach the doctrines, the creed, of the sect, and not otherwise. The entire matter is a fraud ; for no educated or intelligent clergyman in any denomination believes the creed of his own denomination. He knows that more than half of it is absurd nightmare from the Dark Ages. He takes his vow to preach that creed, knowing that he does not believe it and intending never to preach certain features of it. The cleric is bound by his 'Ordination Vow so far as an outward ’“nominal course is concerned, but privately he acknowledges his disbeliefs and thereby stultifies himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An occasional minister will be found in country districts willing to preach the Creed of his denomination in full. But these are few and generally uneducated and, therefore, excusable. Some, however, when called to task respecting things which they preach, but which they admit they do not believe, make answer that their denomination stands back of them and is responsible for the Creed and bound them by 'Ordination Vow to preach it. Thus are the people deceived. The glorious Truth of the Bible is largely hidden. Sectarianism, Churchianity, is maintained; and hypocrisy and unbelief stimulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Church of Rome does not recognize the ordination of any Protestant minister. Until quite recently the Church of England recognized the ordination of the Church of Rome and the Greek Church, but did not recognize the ordination of any of the Protestant denominations. Baptists do not recognize the ordination of Lutherans, Methodists, (Presbyterians, etc.; nor do the others recognize each the Baptist ordination. If a preacher goes from one denomination to another, it is not requisite that he change his mind at all respecting the creeds, however different, but it is necessary that he be reordained by the denomination which he enters. As I refuse to be identified with any of these earthly churches, •I, of course, do not wish an ordination or an authority to preach from any of them, preferring to be independent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pastor Russell Properly Ordained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am glad that they are making known that I am not an ordained clergyman oi their kind; as St. Paul says, I am not ordained of man nor by man, but by the Lord. (Galatians 1:1.) In mentioning ordination, these clerics are counting on the ignorance of their people on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Personally, I would not have such an ordination to preach false doctrines, misrepresent God’s character, deceive the people and stultify myself, if it were ■backed by all the wealth of the world. On the contrary, I rejoice in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made me free and in the ordination which comes to me through God’s Word, “Go, teach all peoples,” and the ordination mentioned in the Scriptures as the Divine authority ; namely, the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the understanding of God’s Word.— Isaiah 61: 1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Only One True Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nothing in the Bible gives authority for the organization of any of these churches. The Church which Jesus-founded, and of which the Apostles were the inspired teachers, is Soripturally declared to be “the Church of the Firstborns, whose names are written in Heaven.” This Church is joined only upon God’s terms, and the names are written or blotted out only by the Redeemer Himself. On its roll-call we doubt not there are saintly persons who are members of all denominations; but their earthly membership, being ^&quot;ntrary to the Scriptures, does not promote them in the Lord’s esteem; but, on the contrary, they are trammeled, hindered thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the Bible, whoever joins the Church of Christ does so by joining Christ Himself—by surrendering his will to the Master—by becoming His pupil and follower—by exercising faith in Him —by being begotten of the Holy Spirit— by cultivating the fruits and graces of that Spirit—by thus being made ready for the inheritance of the saints—the Millennial Kingdom. These, as the Apostle declares, are children of God and, if children, then heirs—‘heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ their Lord, if so be that they suffer with Him, that they may be also glorified together—in His Kingdom, now soon to be manifested. —Romans 8 :17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Church of Christ, according to the Bible, has an earthly association, but it is not a bondage. It has no creed but the Bible. All of its members are brethren. None of them are lords. None of them are of the clergy class. -None lord it over God’s heritage. In their voluntary association as brethren some are recognized as Elder brethren, and are given more particular charge in the Church by the stretching forth of the hands of the Congregation in voting for them and by the subsequent co-operatibh of the Holy Spirit assisting them in the service of the Ecclesia. There are also Deacons, or servants in the Ecclesia who specially attend to other matters. There are also, according to the Scriptures<sub>r </sub>some who may be recognized as Pastors,, or shepherds of the flock, under the great Chief Shepherd and Bishop of their souls<sub>r </sub>the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So far from separating God’s people into clergy and laity, the Scriptures insist that only One is the Master, that all others of the Lord’s people are brethren. They are all ordained of God to be Divine ambassadors, to speak forth the Word of God as they have talent -and opportunity. The qualifying ordination set forth in the Scriptures is that they Shall have received the begetting of the Holy Spirit. This is said to be “an unction from the Holy One”—an anointing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is typified in the holy anointing oil used by the Jewish high priest. As that anointing was poured upon the head of the priest and ran down to the skirts of his garment, so in antitype the anointing of all the members of the true Church took place in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. He was anointed of the Father to be the Bishop of our souls, to •be the Head over the Church which is the Royal Priesthood. He is our great High Priest. His ordaining and anointing is the one which extends to all the members of His Church, giving the humblest of the Lord’s people full ordination of God to speak His Word in His name and to expound the same to the extent of his talents and opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This ordination canie upon Jesus at the time of His baptism, and was recognized as coming to the Church at Pentecost and has been with the Church ever since. Whoever, therefore, comes into the true Church of Christ by union with the living Head comes under the Scriptural ordination. What was prophesied of the Head is applicable to all His members; namely, “The 'Spirit of .the Lord God is upon Me; because He hath anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek; to bind up the broken-hearted; to declare the acceptable year of the Lord.”—Isaiah 61:1, 2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WINE WHICH MADE THE NATIONS DRUNK </span><span class="font5">sacrifice. She has especially separated herself from the people under the clergy titleshe has practised and prospered; she has fought down the true followers of Jesus, causing them to suffer for righteousness’ sake, even as the Jews crucified Jesus, and as the Apostles suffered for loyalty to Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Intoxicated by her successes, she went to great lengths of boasting, establishing hersdlf as the Queen of Heaven, ruling over the kings of the earth, yet having fellowship with them and drawing support from them. Both kings and peoples were made drunk, infatuated, with the thought that they could have so close dealings with the Divine Kingdom and still live after the flesh. Degradation, mental and moral, ensued, while kings and peoples went into a drunken sleep from which they are not yet fully aroused, not yet fully awake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Daughters of Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Sixteenth Century brought a partial awakening, but the Adversary was at hand to re-entangle those mentally confused by the adulterated wine—the mixture of Heavenly Truth with earthly selfishness and deviltry. The time had not yet come for the binding of Satan, and the Lord allowed him to continue to make the way narrow for the zealous, saintly few. To have allowed the full light of Truth to shine in upon the world at that time would have meant the permission of the great Time of Trouble nearly three centuries too soon; for the Lord’s Kingdom would not be ready for establishment until the full end of the six thousapd years of the reign of Sin and Death, and the completion of the elect number of the True Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For these reasons God permitted the various Protestant Churches to be born, ©nd to develop under the influence of the intoxicating Cup of their Mother. This being true, we are not surprised </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font5"> the prophetic declaration that , the Daughters fed the Mother’s disposition and became Harlots like her to the extent of their opportunities—affiliating with the kingdoms of the world, co-operating with them, modifying doctrines so as to meet with their approval, etc. Each Daughter has done her share to perpetuate the intoxication of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Babylon Is Fallen, Is Fallen!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name Babylon fits the entire household. The word contains a double thought: first, the Gate of God; and second, confusion. Thus it imports that the nnnfossod Church, the Gateway to God and righteousness, became confused, impure and adulterous. Each must judge for himself as respects who and what these symbols of the Divine Revelation signify. I believe that not many of God’s people who are awake and even partially sobered up from the false doctrines of the creeds and their perversion of the 'Scriptures will need further assistance in seeing that Babylon, the name originally applied to the Mother Church, has become a family name, applicable equally to all human systems fraudulently posing as the True Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures tell us that this True •Church has not yet been glorified; that her members are being called, developed, ferfeeted under afflictions, in preparation for their exaltation to be the Bride, the Lamb’s Wife. The true members of this Church, whose names are written in Heaven, are all Virgins, pure, in that they fire justified through faith ' in the Redeemer, and are not in relationship with worldly systems, not organized by them, not serving them and not dependent upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the Lord prophesied this Babylon system, he evidently purposed to permit it to have the control it has had. When telling us that “Babylon is fallen,” He intimates that throughout the past some of Has saintly ones have been in Babylon. Otherwise He would not say, “Come out of her.”—Revelation 18 :4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s voice calling His people out of Babylon at the time s'he is rejected for destruction is not a literal voice from Heaven, nor is it a voice from earth. It is the voice of the 'Truth. As knowledge respecting God, His character and His Plan, as revealed in the Bible, now comes to the attention of any of God’s consecrated people, the voice of the Truth, appealing to his honesty, calls him to come out at any cost and stand separate from all earthly institutions. The Divine Message tells us that the literal fall of these great systems is at hand, and that everybody in them will suffer justly—in proportion to their enlightenment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Morning Hour, the Drunken Awake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to Bible Chronology, the six thousand years of the reign of Sin and Death have ended. We are in the dawning of the New Dispensation, when old things are passing away and the New Order is being gradually introduced. Properly, the awakening came first to God’s consecrated people, who have long waited and prayed for the ‘Morning— “Thy Kingdom come! Thy will he done on earth, even as it is done in Heaven I”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The awakening in the Church has gone on gradually during the Parousia of Christ. Meantime, the Millennial blessings beginning to come to the world have made the drunken sleepers restless. As they awaken to the rich blessings of our time, they are seized with feverish acquisitiveness, individually and nationally. As individuals have been racking their brains in respect to money-getting, so nations, impelled by the same spirit of avarice, have been plotting and scheming for extension of territory, trade, etc. As education has permeated to the lower strata of society, it has awakened the whole world. •Hundreds of millions are keenly alert to take advantage of every circumstance and condition ; and everything except the material interests of this life seems to be ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the awakening of the people, as we might expect, exhibits all phases, of human character—good, evil and foolish. The sufferings of the war-stricken people touch deeply a sympathetic chord in human nature, prompting generosity and sometimes even leading public servants to forget that they have no right to donate public money to any cause, but that the people they serve have the right to exercise their own charity at their own expense. However, the disposition to give food and clothing to those in need clearly indicates that in the hearts of humanity in general there continues to abide some measure of the Godlikeness with which our race was originally endowed-—'the chief element of Godlikeness being love; for “God is Love.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Half-Sobered Foolishness Displayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are liable to a certain amount of foolishness as we awaken from the ignorance and superstition and get our first glimpse of the sufferings of those in the war zone. To illustrate: The cables recently told that a United States warship had cleared from an English port, laden with Christmas toys to be distributed -to the unfortunate children of the war refugees in Belgium and France. It seems a joke to send a war vessel on such an errand. Thousands of dollars’ worth of coal were required, besides the time and attention of a ship’s crew, to take a lot of dolls, teddy-bears and knick-knacks to children much more in need of food and clothing. We are not faulting the kind hearts that desire to do something for the sufferers, but we do wonder that the heads of our intelligent statesmen should lend themselves to such foolishness, even though it emanated from hard-headed journalists who induced school children to such folly. The effect of this mental confusion is to awaken thinking people to the real facts of the case and greatly to discredit fffl effort on behalf of the war sufferers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thinking people are saying to themselves : The warring nations should each look out for the victims of their war. They are bound to do this through self-respect at home and abroad. Assistance from us should not 'be necessary —is not necessary. Money spent thus benefits the givers more than the receivers; for those who should look after the needy will probably content themselves with saying to the unfortunates, “Did you not get your share of the American donation?” Thus our intended generosity may merely help to prolong war and do injury to those we wish to benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, the “submerged 'tenth” at home are in straits and likely to suffer this &quot;winter—perhaps fully as much as the Belgian refugees. Hundreds •have already been evicted because of inability to pay their rent and, with their few belongings in the street, are certainly nearly as much to be pitied—perhaps more—as the war refugees across the ocean. Surely charity begins at home! We therefore highly commend a general movement toward HOME 'RELIEF, believing it to be a safe and sane policy in accord with the teachings of the Bible —“He that provideth not for his own * * * is worse than an infidel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people at our doors are our own responsibility. In many respects the war is more injurious here than in the warring countries. There, government contracts for army rations, clothing, military apparatus, shipbuilding, etc., are causing great business prosperity, especially in •Germany and Great Britain. Here, on the contrary, the avenues of business are dislocated. The foreign absorption of gold causes financial embarrassment and stringency, the discharge of clerks, mechanics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Few of the awakening ones realize that the present war is permitted for the weakening of the nations, preparatory to the utter collapse of the present .order of things and the ushering in of the New Order of things—the Reign of rignteous-ness, under Messiah’s Kingdom. The aroused sleeper should face about to the rising Sun of Righteousness with healing in His beams and blessings for all nations. (Malachi 4:2.) Were this recognized, there would be less of the war spirit here at home, less of a fear of what could be accomplished by enemies across the deeps, more of a confidence in the Lord, and an endeavor to please and obey Him. But the maddening wine still intoxicates many Americans, and will yet probably embroil our nation in strife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Religionists Also Awakening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for religion, the awakened ones reject the major portion of the creeds of the past, yet carefully cling to any rights or privileges which those false doctrines gave them. Thus the Divine right of kings, nobles, princes and governments, and rites and ceremonies, civil and ecclesiastical, are firmly clutched and held high above the people in the interests of the rulers. This is the secret of the willingness of the earthly kings, emperors and princes, financial princes and subservient religionists to engage in the present horrible strife. The argument with all is that the end justifies the means. The ends .sought are commercial supremacy, political .supremacy; and, incidentally, the religious systems are praying for a backing-up of the various contestants whom they have long taught are kingdoms of God, guided by Divine Wisdom and Providential care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord no longer restrains these; for His time has come that iniquity should have an end; that the Harlot systems should make manifest that none of them is the Bride of Christ; and that the kings of earth might humble each other and thus make ready for the true Kingdom of God—for the Reign of Christ and His Church, glorified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The masses of mankind have been slowly awakening for some time; but the present war is sure to thoroughly awaken the whole world, and the maddening effect of the false doctrines will anger the entire human family. As they realize how they were drugged with the false doctrines, the tendency with the majority will be to go to the opposite extreme— to lose faith in everything. The result undoubtedly will be pandemonium, as the Scriptures portray—'“Every man’s hand against his neighbor”—anarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Patching the Old Garment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many, realizing to some extent the matters we here portray, are earnestly advocating some kind of patched-up compromise—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> reformation in the churches, a discarding of the creeds in fact while holding to them in theory, a laboring on the part of all for social betterments, etc. We commend this spirit as better than the “stand-pat” program of others; but it is too late. ’ The opportunity for such a reformation has passed. As the Scriptures declare, “We would have healed •Babylon, but she is not healed.” (Jeremiah 51:9.) There was a lack of desire for healing, for purification, for forgiveness, for turning away from illicit intercourse with the kingdoms of this world to affiliation with the Lord alone. Only the few had the proper spirit. They are the Lord’s Jewels.—Mal. 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This Christian Age in many respects corresponds to the Jewish Age, which was its prototype. Hence our Lord’s words respecting Natural Israel apply here also. He declared the New Dispensation so different from the Old that it would be like putting a new patch into an old garment; that it would be like putting new wine into old wineskins which had lost their elasticity and could not withstand the strain. Hence the Jewish Dispensation was set aside, and the New Order of things was inaugurated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">•So here, there is sufficient contrast between the things of this Present Order— religious, financial, social, political—and the New Order of things that the two cannot possibly intermix, cannot possibly be patched up. Instead, the Lord declares that the Present Order of things, symbolically represented by “the heavens and the earth,” the ecclesiastical heavens and the social earth, are to pass away utterly, absolutely, in the great conflagration, which will not be literal fire, but symbolic—anarchy. Meantime, however, the Lord promises us that the New Order of things to take the place of the Present Order, will be “the desire of all nations”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“a</span><span class="font5"> new heavens,” the glorified •Church; “a new earth,” a new 'social order. This is the hope of the world. There is none other.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In view of these things, it behooves every Child of God to heed the voice of God, to stand free from Babylon, to manifest the spirit of the Lord, to become a true Bible student, a true overcomer of the world and its spirit, faithful upto death, that he may be accounted worthy of the Crown of Life and a share with his Master in the Millennial Kingdom Throne. And as respects those who are not the Lord’s consecrated people, but who love the Truth and righteousness, •there are but two courses open. The first and better one is a full surrender to the Lord, a full consecration of the heart, will, time, influence—all-—for the service of the Truth; or, second, but less satisfactory, an endeavor to live soberly, ■righteously, justly, truthfully, sympathetically, mercifully.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Whoever wins, we lose.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In this pithy and painful phrase repeated over and over again by the Jewish press is compressed the whole calamity which confronts the Jewish people, who live among the nations which are now engaged in the death struggle for supremacy. Millions of the Jewish people are living in the region's where the conflagration is spreading ruin and destruction from day to day, and while the gains and emoluments of victory will be shared by others, their losses will be entirely their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“All the horrors of fire and sword, devastation and destruction are now added to the tragedy of Jewish homelessness and persecution. Again are Jewish citizens giving their last and best proof of devotion to their adopted countries by laying down their lives on the field of battle— by killing their own Jewish brethren of other countries. But the grim irony of the situation is beyond expression when it is remembered that the Jewish combatants on the opposing sides are fighting for countries which deny them their human rights. Proof of Jewish devotion to duty has never been lacking, but now that we behold it again on the field of battle we have before us a new indictment of the moral turpitude of the European governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The losses of the war, the reverses and misfortunes will fall heavily upon the shoulders of the Jews, who receive very little consideration from their governments, either in times of war or of peace.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;For He must reig</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">M</span><span class="font5">ANY of us have learned to appreciate a republican form of government as the very highest type of civil administration. We trust that we are not one whit behind the most patriotic in our appreciation of the great Government of these United States, which many of us believe is the noblest that has yet risen amongst men. Nevertheless, the Bible teaches that Messiah’s Reign will be that of a monarchy ; and not only so, but that it will be a very exclusive and aristocratic monarchy. Additionally, it will be most autocratic— theocratic; for the will of its subjects will not be consulted in the slightest particular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At first, in alarm, we are ready to say, Would not that be a most dangerous condition of things? Could any royal family, however noble and generous, be entrusted with such autocratic power without fear of its being misused for the enslavement of the people, for the aggrandizement of the rulers? Have we not learned this in the history of the past six thousand years? Do we not see the necessity for curtailing and controlling the powers of kings and governors? Are we not more and more brought to realize the necessity that the people shall rule, whether in Congress or in Parliament, in Doumas or in 'Chambers of Deputies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yes, yes, we heartily' accede to all this; but when we shall describe -the nature of the Kingdom thaf is to be established, and its personnel, all your fears will assuredly flee, and you will rejoice exceedingly that the Divine arrangement is what it is in respect to the theocratic Kingdom shortly to be established and to take over the government of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">iScripturally it is described as the Fifth ’Universal Empire of earth. We,, remind you of the Divinely inspired' dream ,of King Nebuchadnezzar, as interpreted by the Prophet Daniel. It was of an image majestic, grand. The head of the image was Nebuchadnezzar’s own kingdom’ at Babylon, the first to rule over the earth. Next, represented in the breast and the arms of silver, came Medo-Persia, the second Universal Empire of earth, the conqueror of Babylon. Next, represented in the belly and thighs of the image, came 'Grecia, the third Universal Empire of earth, which conquered Medo-Persia. Next, represented in the legs of iron, came Rome, the fourth Universal Empire, conqueror of Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are to be no more until Messiah’s Kingdom; it will be the fifth. Meantime, we have had two attempts at a fifth monarchy, both unsuccessful. One of these attempts was by the Papacy; the other was that of Napoleon I. During this time the present divisions, which resulted from the' breaking up of the Roman Empire, are represented by the feet of the image, with their ten toes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Smiting the Image’s Feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophecy declares (Daniel 2:44) that in the days of these kings, represented by the toes of the image, the God of Heaven will set up a Kingdom, which shall subdue all kingdoms and which shall never be overthrown. It shall “be given to the people, saints, of the Most High 'God, and they shall take the Kingdom and possess it forever, even forever and ever.” (Daniel 7 :18, 27.) In the picture God’s Kingdom is symbolically represented as a great Stone, hewn from the mountain without hands—su-pernaturally. It shall smite the image in its feet; and forthwith “the iron, the brass, the silver and the gold shall become like the chaff of a threshing’ floor, and the wind shall carry it away;” but the Mountain shall increase until “it shall fill the whole, earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus in a figure, or symbol, God pictures things now shortly to come to pass. This crushing; of the feet of the image was to come in the end of the Age, and would be the preparatory step to the establishment of Messiah’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">, So long as these governments would be here, they and Messiah’s Kingdom •could not co-operate. The Gentile powers are based on selfishness and coercion; Christ’s Kingdom will be based on justice, love, mercy, under the Prince of Peace. The two could not rule at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rome and Constantinople stand for, represent, the two legs of the image</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">till He hath put all enemies under His feet.”-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">which King Nebuchadnezzar saw; for be it remembered that each in turn was the ’Roman Capital and representative of the image. We are certainly justified in watching with considerable interest the present war and what it may be leading to in the way of involving all the ten kingdoms represented in this prophecy. Our thought is that this great war will weaken the nations, cripple the world financially and discredit the rulers in the eyes of their peoples. Thus it will open the way for Socialism, which will eventually lead on to revolution, then to anarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The present terrible war is not the foretold destruction in the fullest sense of the word, but merely its forerunner. The Scriptures foretell a great Time of Trouble to be brought on by anarchy— the general uprising of the people: “Every man’s hand against his neighbor, no peace to him that goeth out nor to him that cometh in.” (Zechariah 8:10; 14:1'3.) But that is not the special point of interest in our subject; rather, we are discussing the character of Messiah’s Kingdom, which is to rule the world, overthrow Sin and Death, and uplift humanity from ignorance, superstition, sin, weakness and death. The declaration is that Messiah shall reign until He shall have put down all insubordination, and that the last enemy to be destroyed will be death.—1 Corinthians 15 :25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is the Kingdom for which the Master Himself taught His followers to pray. Nothing slight or insignificant will be the outcome of that glorious Messianic Reign of a thousand years. At its very beginning Satan will be bound, with all that this signifies—the repression of evil and darkness. For a thousand years the Bun of Righteousness shall pour forth the light of truth and </span><span class="font4">grace upon our poor, fallen race until </span><span class="font5">the knowledge of God’s glory shall fill the whole earth as the waters coyer the great deep.—Habakkuk 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">•Eventually all wilful opponents of that Kingdom will die the .Second Death, from which there will be no redemption, no recovery. But meantime, all the willing and obedient will be rising, not only from the tomb, but also out of all the weaknesses and frailties of the present time, up, up, up, to the fulness of perfection of life, although they will not live again in this perfect sense until the thousand years shall be finished. With the close of the Reign of Righteousness, after it shall have accomplished its work of delivering the groaning creation from the bondage of corruption, sin and death, Messiah will abdicate the Throne; as it is written, “He will deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father, that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He </span><span class="font5">may be all in all.”—1 Corinthians 15 :24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">No More Sighing, Crying, Dying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What a glorious triumph that will be when every creature in Heaven and earth, and under the earth, shall be heard saying, Praise, glory, honor, dominion and might be unto Him that sitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb, forever I (Revelation 5 :13.) What a glorious condition will then obtain when there shall be no more crying, no more sighing, no more dying; for all the former things shall have passed away! Ah, He that sitteth upon the Throne said, “Behold, I make all things new!” Glad we are that our great Messiah is about to overthrow sin and evil, about to establish righteousness on a permanent and everlasting foundation, which will insure that to all eternity God’s will shall be done as perfectly in the earth as it is now done in Heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We ask you to consider candidly—• Is there a kingdom in the world today that in your judgment fitly represents a Divine Government amongst men? Is there a perfect government, is there a single spot in all the earth where God’s will is done as it is done in Heaven? You are conversant with history. You know the bloody record which marks its pages. You know that so-called Christian Europe has been drenched with blood more than any other part of the world. You know that the cause of wrong has triumphed as often or oftener than the cause of right. You know that today these kingdoms of Europe, styled kingdoms of God, are destroying one another. You know that great guns, great battleships and monster torpedoes, etc., such as the world</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">— 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Corinthians</span><span class="font4"> 15:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">has never known before, have been prepared by these various nations for use, either aggressively or defensively, against one another, while they all claim to be Christ’s kingdoms. Is this logical? Is this rational? Most assuredly not!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must go to the Bible for true information on this subject. It tells us that these kingdoms are not the kingdoms of God, but “kingdoms of this world.” It tells us that Satan is the Prince of this world (John 14:30; Ephesians 2:2) ; that he is “the god of this world,” “that now worketh in the hearts of the children of disobedience”—so much more numerous than the children of obedience that he through them holds the world’s control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But with equal clearness the Bible declares the Divine Power and mastery over Satan—that he and his reign of Sin and Death are permitted of God for a limited time and for a special purpose. The testimony tells us that when the due time shall come Messiah shall take His great power and reign, and then iSatan shall be bound and all the forces of sin and darkness be restrained. Then the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in its beams to flood the earth with the light of the knowledge of the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Election Hath Obtained It.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Come and take a cursory view of God’s great work thus far accomplished : For more than two thousand years God gave no clear intimation of what He intended to do for the fallen race. Then He made a statement to Abraham, so clear, so explicit, that .St. Paul deciares that it was a statement of the Gospel in advance. God said to Abraham, I purpose to bless the world. This could only mean, I purpose to relieve them of the curse of death which came upon them through Adam’s sin. God added to Abraham, This blessing which I will bring to all the families of the earth will come through your posterity—“In thee and in thy Seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s due time for bringing this blessing was still future; the blessing could not come until Messiah should come; but meantime God gave to the natural seed of Abraham, through Moses, the Law Covenant, which offered them eternal life and an inheritance in the Kingdom if they could keep the Law. Of course, they could not keep the Law; for it was the measure of a perfect man’s ability, and alas! like the remainder of the’ world, the Israelites were imperfect— sinners. Nevertheless the offer and their attempt to keep the Law brought them great uplift of heart, so that when Jesus came to them a considerable number were ready to receive Him, did receive Him ; and He received them. They became sons of God, through the begetting of the Holy Spirit, at Pentecost and afterward. These were the Spiritual •Seed of Abraham, begotten of the Holy iSpirit, Jesus Himself being the Head, or first; the others were counted in as members of His Body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Israel had been hoping for a share in Messiah’s Kingdom; and St. Paul explains, “Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for, but the Election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.” The blinded Israelites are still cast aside, but not forever. The Divine blessing shall come to Natural Israel just as soon as Spiritual Israel shall be completed,—Romans 11:25-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Kingdom Suffereth Violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What did the Election obtain? Of what did the faithful “Israelites indeed” become heirs by accepting Jesus and by the Pentecostal blessing? We answer that they became identified with Messiah’s Kingdom and heirs or inheritors, of the glorious Promise made to Abraham, that in this Kingdom all the families of the earth should be blessed. But now note that there were not a sufficient number of Jews found worthy to complete the Kingdom class. The Kingdom therefore could not be inaugurated then. God had foreseen this and through the Prophet had promised that some would be gathered from the Gentiles to complete this Kingdom class. The entire work of the Gospel Age has been the calling of this “elect” class for the Kingdom. If we have rightly viewed the matter, the foreordained number will soon have been found, the election will be at an end, the accepted will be glorified as the Kingdom, and Messiah’s Reign of Righteousness will begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■But notice now the course of all belonging to the Kingdom class, throughout this Age. They are not reigning with Christ, but suffering with Christ. Jesus explained this; they are indeed of the Royal Family, because begotten of the Holy Spirit; they are indeed the Kingdom class, because they are affiliated with the great King; but they have not yet entered into their glory. They will do so only by the power of the First Resurrection. Thus it is written, “We must all be changed,” because “flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.”—1 Corinthians 15 :'5O, 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our Lord Himself was the Pattern, the Forerunner, of all these. After His consecration and His begetting of the Holy Spirit, He was tested unto death, even the death of the cross, before He experienced His glorious resurrection change and ascended and sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on High. Similarly all of His followers, after consecration, must be tested, their loyalty must be proven, before, they can share with Him in “His Resurrection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Partly for the testing of these, their development takes place in a time when Satan is the Prince of this world, and when his power is permitted to be exercised against them as it was exercised against their Lord. The Message to these is, “The Kingdom suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.” As. our Lord suffered violence from the Prince of this world, so will His followers ; for “the disciple is not above his Lord.” His promise to His followers is, “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”—'Rev. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“The World Knoweth Us Not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So then we perceive that God’s Kingdom class, the followers of Jesus, have been suffering violence, just as did their Leader, for righteousness’ sake. That the persecutors had not known and done their evil work intentionally, St. Peter intimates when he says to the Jews, “I wot that in ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers; for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Prince of Life.” Hence, in due time their blindness shall be turned away, and they will look upon Him whom they pierced and mourn (Zechariah 12:10) ; and God will pour upon them the spirit of prayer and supplication, and forgive them and make the experience profitable to as many as shall prove willing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meantime, for eighteen centuries, the Scriptures declare, “The world knoweth us. not, even as it knew Him not.” God’s saintly ones have not been generally the great, the influential, either in church or state, just as Jesus and the Apostles were not in their day. Nevertheless, the •Lord knoweth them that are His. Scattered here and there, during the past eighteen centuries, He has been dealing with them, preparing them, polishing them, fitting them as jewels. And He tells us that at our Lord’s Second Gom-ing He will make up His jewels—they will constitute the Kingdom class; for “if we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with Him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are sure all will agree that those whom the Lord has been so carefully selecting, instructing and polishing in the School of Christ, who have been so effectively polished with the trials and disciplines of evil, wJl be the very class above all others to whom the glorious dominion of earth may well be entrusted without fear. Only those thoroughly loyal to God and to principle will be in that Kingdom class.</span></p>

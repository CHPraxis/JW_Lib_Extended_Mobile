<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLEASE GIVE TO SCHOOL OVERSEER</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THEOCRATIC MINISTRY SCHOOL REVIEW ANSWER SHEET COVERING ASSIGNMENTS FOR WEEKS OF SEPTEMBER 7 THROUGH OCTOBER 26, 2015.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nwt</span><span class="font3">] and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font3">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">INSTRUCTIONS: Each one should have the questions for the review as set out in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our KingdomMinistry.</span><span class="font0"> The school overseer may ask auxiliary questions, as time permits, in order to clarify main points, to highlight the reasons for the answers, or to elicit comments on how the material can be applied. It is not always practical for the answer sheet to contain all possible answers; so any answer that the audience gives that is appropriate and in harmony with our present understanding is acceptable, even if the point is not found on the answer sheet. Until the congregation has taken this review, the answer sheet is not to be made available to the congregation to read, but it should be used by the school overseer during the preceding weeks as a guide to points that he wants to emphasize for the congregation. It is not necessary for the school overseer to read all the answers from the answer sheet if the points have already been covered. The review should not exceed 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">NOTE TO SCHOOL OVERSEERS: Please select an approved </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> Study reader to read from the platform some of the scriptures cited in or after each question that appears in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">OurKingdomMinistry.</span><span class="font0"> Cited texts should usually be read before you ask the printed question. In view of the limited time allotted for the review, you may use your discretion in determining whether certain Scripture citations should be read or be summarized briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The date in brackets represents the week that the material was to be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. How does the account at 2 Kings 13:18, 19 illustrate the importance of being zealous and wholehearted in serving God? [Sept. 7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w10</span><span class="font3"> 4/15 p. 26 par. 11] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the case of King Jehoash, striking the earth five or six times would have indicated striking down Syria to the finishing point. However, because Jehoash acted with a lack of zeal, he experienced limited success. Jehovah will abundantly bless us only if we do his work wholeheartedly and with zeal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. Who was reigning in Israel when Jonah served as a prophet, and what can we appreciate about Jonah’s ministry in view of what is recorded at 2 Kings 14:2325? [Sept. 7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w09</span><span class="font3"> 1/1 p. 25 par. 4] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jonah served as a prophet during the reign of King Jeroboam II. Sadly, this wicked king influenced Israel to continue doing “what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes.” So Jonah’s service could not have been easy, yet he carried it out faithfully.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. How did Ahaz demonstrate his lack of trust in God’s word spoken through the prophet Isaiah, and what question might we ask ourselves when making important decisions? (2 Ki. 16:7) [Sept. 14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w13</span><span class="font3"> 11/15 p. 17 par. 5] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Instead of trusting in God’s word through Isaiah, faithless Ahaz entered into a disastrous pact with the Assyrians, which ultimately led to Judah’s being oppressed by them. What a disappointment Ahaz was as a shepherd of Judah! When we have important decisions to make, do we put our trust in God and not in men?</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prov. 3:5, 6</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. What tactic used by the Rabshakeh is being used by opposers of God’s people today, and what quality can help us to reject the false reasoning of opposers? (2 Ki. 18:22, 25) [Sept. 14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w10</span><span class="font3"> 7/15 p. 13 pars. 3-4] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Rabshakeh used cunning reasoning in an effort to plant doubts. Today, scheming persecutors may share bits of truthful information with which they aim to establish common ground, but they subtly intersperse that truth with lies, hoping to plant doubts. However, discernment will help us to reject the false reasoning of opposers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. How can Josiah’s example of humility help us to benefit more fully from our Bible reading and study? (2 Ki. 22:19, 20, ftn.) [Sept. 21, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w00</span><span class="font3"> 3/1 p. 30 par. 2] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When Josiah heard the words of the Law read to him, they deeply touched his heart. The account says that his heart was responsive, or “soft,” so that he humbled himself and was receptive to the counsel of God’s Word. Humility is a vital factor in having a prepared heart because it makes us teachable and helps us to accept more readily loving counsel and correction that we receive from God’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">6. How has archaeology confirmed the existence of the two kings mentioned at 2 Kings 25:27-30? [Sept. 28, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w12</span><span class="font3"> 6/1 p. 5 pars. 2-3] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">King Jehoiachin and King Evil-merodach are mentioned in Second Kings, chapter 25. Among the ruins of ancient Babylon, archaeologists uncovered documents listing “Yaukin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehoiachin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">]</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">,” who was the “king of the land of Yahud </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Judah</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">,” and his household. Also, Evil-merodach’s name is mentioned in an inscription on a vase.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">7. What three requests did Jabez make of Jehovah, and what does this teach us about prayer? (1 Chron. 4:9, 10) [Oct. 5, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w10</span><span class="font3"> 10/1 p. 23] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jabez prayed for the peaceful enlargement of his territory, for God’s hand to be with him, and for him to be preserved from calamity. Jabez’s prayer revealed a sincere concern for true worship, and Jehovah took note of it. We too need to offer heartfelt prayers in harmony with Jehovah’s will, knowing that he delights in hearing the prayers of his true worshippers and in answering them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">8. How can the outcome of the war described at 1 Chronicles 5:18-22 strengthen us to carry on our spiritual warfare courageously? [Oct. 12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w05</span><span class="font3"> 10/1 p. 9 par. 7] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The tribes east of the Jordan defeated their enemies even though those tribes were outnumbered more than 2 to 1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">They were victorious because the valiant men of those tribes trusted in Jehovah and looked to him for help. We too can have complete confidence in Jehovah as we carry on our spiritual warfare against formidable odds.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eph. 6:10-17</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">9. Why was David able to understand and respect the spirit of Jehovah’s law on the sanctity of blood, and what should David’s example move us to do? (1 Chron. 11:17-19) [Oct. 19, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w12</span><span class="font3"> 11/15 pp. 6-7 pars. 12-14] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When David refused to drink water obtained at the risk of human life, he showed that he understood the principle behind God’s law on blood. To understand the spirit of the Law, David must have studied and meditated deeply on it. When we study the Bible, we are wise to meditate on what we read and store it in our heart so that we can determine what pleases Jehovah in a particular case.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">10. What did David neglect to do when he attempted to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem, and what vital lesson can we learn from this account? (1 Chron. 15: 13) [Oct. 26, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w03</span><span class="font3"> 5/1 pp. 10-11 pars. 11-13] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When moving the Ark the first time, David neglected to ascertain Jehovah’s will on how to carry out the matter. Though David frequently inquired of Jehovah, he failed to do so on this occasion, and the result was disastrous. When we are subjected to pressures, we should always make sure of what is acceptable to Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

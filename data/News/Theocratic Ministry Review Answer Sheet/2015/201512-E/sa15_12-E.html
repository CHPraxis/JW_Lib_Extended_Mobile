<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLEASE GIVE TO SCHOOL OVERSEER</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THEOCRATIC MINISTRY SCHOOL REVIEW ANSWER SHEET COVERING ASSIGNMENTS FOR WEEKS OF NOVEMBER 2 THROUGH DECEMBER 28, 2015.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nwt</span><span class="font3">], </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font3">], and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Draw Close to Jehovah</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cl</span><span class="font3">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">INSTRUCTIONS: Each one should have the questions for the review as set out in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our KingdomMinistry.</span><span class="font0"> The school overseer may ask auxiliary questions, as time permits, in order to clarify main points, to highlight the reasons for the answers, or to elicit comments on how the material can be applied. It is not always practical for the answer sheet to contain all possible answers; so any answer that the audience gives that is appropriate and in harmony with our present understanding is acceptable, even if the point is not found on the answer sheet. Until the congregation has taken this review, the answer sheet is not to be made available to the congregation to read, but it should be used by the school overseer during the preceding weeks as a guide to points that he wants to emphasize for the congregation. It is not necessary for the school overseer to read all the answers from the answer sheet if the points have already been covered. The review should not exceed 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">NOTE TO SCHOOL OVERSEERS: Please select an approved </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> Study reader to read from the platform some of the scriptures cited in or after each question that appears in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">OurKingdomMinistry.</span><span class="font0"> Cited texts should usually be read before you ask the printed question. In view of the limited time allotted for the review, you may use your discretion in determining whether certain Scripture citations should be read or be summarized briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The date in brackets represents the week that the material was to be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. Did David treat his captives savagely, as some conclude from 1 Chronicles 20:3? [Nov. 2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w05</span><span class="font3"> 2/15 p. 27] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">David’s actions have been misunderstood because of the way some Bible translations render this verse. However, the “New World Translation” accurately conveys the thought that David put the defeated Ammonites to work with saws and axes; he did not “cut them with saws . . . and with axes,” as the “King James Version” renders this verse. David did not copy the sadistic and brutal war customs of his day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. What moved David to show a spirit of generosity, and what will help us to do the same? (1 Chron. 22:5) [Nov. 9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w05</span><span class="font3"> 10/1 p. 11 par. 7] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Although he was not commissioned to build Jehovah’s temple, David exhibited a generous spirit because he appreciated that all he had acquired was because of Jehovah’s goodness. If we reflect appreciatively on all that Jehovah has done for us, similar feelings of gratitude will move us to have a spirit of generosity in supporting the Kingdom work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. What did David mean when he said to Solomon: “Know the God of your father”? (1 Chron. 28:9) [Nov. 16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w10</span><span class="font3"> 11/1 p. 30 pars.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">3, 7] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">David wanted his son to do more than just believe in God. He wanted Solomon to cultivate something he himself treasured—a close personal relationship with Jehovah. To do this would require digging into the Scriptures in an effort to know Jehovah intimately.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">4. What did Solomon’s request at 2 Chronicles 1:10 reveal about him, and what might we learn by analyzing our personal prayers to Jehovah? (2 Chron. 1:11, 12) [Nov. 23, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w05</span><span class="font3"> 12/1 p. 19 par. 6] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Solomon’s request showed Jehovah that gaining wisdom and knowledge was close to the king’s heart. Our prayers to God reveal what is close to our heart. We are wise to analyze their content.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. According to 2 Chronicles 6:29, 30, what unique ability does Jehovah possess, and why should we open our heart to him in prayer? (Ps. 55:22) [Nov. 30, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w10</span><span class="font3"> 12/1 p. 11 par. 7] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fellow humans may not fully understand our inner feelings—our “own plague” and our “own pain.”</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prov. 14: 10</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">However, Jehovah alone knows our heart, and he deeply cares about us. Pouring out our heart to him in prayer can make our burdens easier to bear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">6. On what basis did Asa pray for victory over an enormous military force, and of what may we be sure in connection with our spiritual warfare? (2 Chron. 14:11) [Dec. 7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w12 </span><span class="font3">8/15 p. 8 par. 6-p. 9 par. 1] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Asa appealed to God on the basis of Jehovah’s name being involved in the conflict with the Ethiopians. Today, our personal battles may include exertion to resist the pervading spirit of moral laxity, to fight our own weaknesses, or to protect our family from defiling influences. Yet, we can be sure that Jehovah will reward with victory all faithful ones who wage spiritual warfare in his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">7. How does the way in which Jehovah dealt with King Jehoshaphat’s failings assure us of God’s love, and how should this affect our view of others? (2 Chron. 19:3) [Dec. 14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w03</span><span class="font3"> 7/1 p. 17 par. 13; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cl</span><span class="font3"> p. 245 par. 12] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When King Jehoshaphat committed a foolish act, Jehovah’s righteous anger did not blind Him to the good in Jehoshaphat. Jehovah reassured Jehoshaphat of His love by telling him: “Nevertheless, there are good things that have been found in you.” When others sin against us, we must be willing to look for and value the good in them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">8. Why and how must we “take [our] position” and “stand still” in our day? (2 Chron. 20:17) [Dec. 21, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w05</span><span class="font3"> 12/1 p. 21 par. 2; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w03</span><span class="font3"> 6/1 p. 21 pars. 15-16] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To “see the salvation of Jehovah,” we need to “take</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">position” in active support of God’s Kingdom by maintaining Christian neutrality, being steadfast in our service to Jehovah, and publicly praising Jehovah for his loyal love. Rather than take matters into our own hands, we must “stand still,” placing our implicit trust in Jehovah and his organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">9. What sobering reminder do we discern in 2 Chronicles 21:20 in connection with the death of Jehoram? [Dec. 21, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w98</span><span class="font3"> 11/15 p. 32 p ar. 4] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The life course of Jehoram illustrates the truthfulness of the Bible proverb: “The memory of the righteous one is due for a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot.”</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prov. 10:7</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Therefore, each of us should soberly consider the kind of name we are making with God and our fellow man.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">10. According to 2 Chronicles 26:5, who exercised a good influence on young Uzziah, and how can youths today benefit from mature Christians in the congregation? [Dec. 28, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w07</span><span class="font3"> 12/15 p. 10 pars. 2, 4] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Zechariah</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">not the prophet</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">exercised a fine influence on the young ruler to do what was right. Youths today can benefit themselves by listening to mature Christians, who can influence them to keep on “searching for God” and to do what is right in Jehovah’s eyes. Youths can show that they treasure mature Christians by giving serious consideration to their advice.</span></p></li></ul>

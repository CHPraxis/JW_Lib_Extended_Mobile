<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLEASE GIVE TO SCHOOL OVERSEER</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THEOCRATIC MINISTRY SCHOOL REVIEW ANSWER SHEET COVERING ASSIGNMENTS FOR WEEKS OF MARCH 2 THROUGH APRIL 27, 2015.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SOURCE MATERIAL: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nwt</span><span class="font3">] and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> [</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font3">].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">INSTRUCTIONS: Each one should have the questions for the review as set out in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Our KingdomMinistry.</span><span class="font0"> The school overseer may ask auxiliary questions, as time permits, in order to clarify main points, to highlight the reasons for the answers, or to elicit comments on how the material can be applied. It is not always practical for the answer sheet to contain all possible answers; so any answer that the audience gives that is appropriate and in harmony with our present understanding is acceptable, even if the point is not found on the answer sheet. Until the congregation has taken this review, the answer sheet is not to be made available to the congregation to read, but it should be used by the school overseer during the preceding weeks as a guide to points that he wants to emphasize for the congregation. It is not necessary for the school overseer to read all the answers from the answer sheet if the points have already been covered. The review should not exceed 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">NOTE TO SCHOOL OVERSEERS: Please select an approved </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> Study reader to read from the platform some of the scriptures cited in or after each question that appears in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">OurKingdomMinistry.</span><span class="font0"> Cited texts should usually be read before you ask the printed question. In view of the limited time allotted for the review, you may use your discretion in determining whether certain Scripture citations should be read or be summarized briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The date in brackets represents the week that the material was to be covered.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. What kind of love is loyal love, and in what areas of life is it especially needed? (Ruth 1: 16, 17) [Mar. 2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w12</span><span class="font3"> 7/1 p. 26 par. 6] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Loyal love—the kind of love that holds on to its object and simply refuses to let go—is a powerful force for good in this darkening world. We need it in marriage, in family relations, in friendships, and in the Christian congregation. As we cultivate that kind of love, we are imitating the outstanding example of Ruth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. How did Ruth acquire the reputation of being “an excellent woman”? (Ruth 3:11) [Mar. 2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w12</span><span class="font3"> 10/1 p. 23 par. 1] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Although Ruth was a Moabitess, her eagerness to get to know Jehovah and to serve him had much to do with her reputation as “an excellent woman.” She had shown great kindness and sensitivity toward Naomi and her people, willingly adapting to ways and customs that were surely unfamiliar to her. If we imitate Ruth’s faith, we will be considerate of others and show respect for their ways and customs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. When we are confronted with problems, in what way can we benefit from Hannah’s example? (1 Sam. 1:16-18) [Mar. 9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w07</span><span class="font3"> 3/15 p. 16 pars. 4-5] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When we pray to Jehovah about our concerns, we can let him know how we feel and make heartfelt requests. If we can do no more to resolve the problem, we should leave the matter in his hands. Then we too can experience a peace similar to that of Hannah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. When Samuel was a boy “growing up before Jehovah,” what was it that protected him from the bad example of Eli’s sons? (1 Sam. 2:21) [Mar. 9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w10</span><span class="font3"> 10/1 p. 16 pars. 2-3] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">At an early age, Samuel centered his life on his service to God. Despite the corruption of High Priest Eli’s sons, Samuel’s close relationship with Jehovah protected him from such bad influences. Today, many Christian youths follow Samuel’s example and keep “growing up before Je-hovah”—even when some around them fail to set a good example.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. In what way can we benefit from Saul’s refusal to act rashly when “worthless men” rejected his kingship? (1 Sam. 10:22, 27) [Mar. 23, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w05</span><span class="font3"> 3/15 p. 23 par. 1] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Saul’s modesty and humility safeguarded him from acting rashly when he first became king. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1 Sam. 9:21</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Likewise, our displaying modesty and humility in our dealings with others will protect us from irrational behavior.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">6. What vital lesson do we learn from Saul’s mistaken view that a sacrifice could be substituted for obedience to Jehovah? (1 Sam. 15:22, 23) [Mar. 30, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w07</span><span class="font3"> 6/15 p. 26 pars. 3-4] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Since Jehovah already owns everything we have in a material way, our obedience to him is better than a sacrifice. Though we have different circumstances and backgrounds, by being obedient, each of us can respond to the vicious claim of Satan the Devil that humans will not remain loyal to God in the face of trials.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">7. Why is it reassuring to know that Jehovah “sees into the heart” of a person? (1 Sam. 16:7) [Apr. 6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w10</span><span class="font3"> 3/1 p. 23 par. 7] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In a world that puts so much emphasis on external beauty, it is comforting to know that Jehovah is not swayed by outward appearance. It is what we are inside, in our heart, that matters to Jehovah. That is a good reason to want to cultivate the kind of qualities that will make us beautiful in God’s eyes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">8. According to Proverbs 1:4, what do we possess that Jehovah expects us to use when facing difficult situations? (1 Sam. 21:12, 13) [Apr. 13, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w05</span><span class="font3"> 3/15 p. 24 par. 4] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah expects us to use our mental faculties and abilities to deal with difficult situations in life. He has given us his inspired Word, which imparts shrewdness, knowledge, and thinking ability. We also have the help of appointed Christian elders and holy spirit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">9. Why can it be said that Abigail was not rebelling against her husband’s headship when she gave provisions to David and his men? (1 Sam. 25:10, 11, 18, 19) [Apr. 20, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w09 </span><span class="font3">7/1 p. 20 par. 3] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nabal had acted wickedly against an anointed servant of Jehovah, an action that was likely to result in death for many innocent members of Na-bal’s household. Had Abigail failed to act, she might have become a sharer in her husband’s guilt. Instead, she put her submission to her God ahead of submission to her husband.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">10. Abigail apologized for something she did not do. How can we benefit from her example? (1 Sam. 25:24) [Apr. 20, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w02</span><span class="font3"> 11/1 p. 5 pars. 1, 4] </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abigail’s humble words of apology for her husband’s rude behavior spared her household and kept David from entering into bloodguilt. Although it was not Abigail who had mistreated David and his men, she accepted the blame for her family and made peace with David. Honest expressions of regret over a bad situation can open the way for further communication and peace.</span></p></li></ul>

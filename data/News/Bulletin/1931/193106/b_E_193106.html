<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Question “Can Books Be Placed?” Is Answered</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">in whom tny soul d&amp;lightelh.”</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah assures his faithful ones that he delights in their love and zeal for him and the honor of his name.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Had Splendid Time in Field for S Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Placed 4,139 Books, 6,024 Booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As announced in former </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins, </span><span class="font3">the Bethel, family were off during both ends of the Watchtower drive, a number of them going out and serving classes throughout the eastern section of the country. During this period approximately eighty classes were served by these brethren, with excellent results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The report of the family as a whole is also very gratifying. The Lord’s blessing was upon the effort put forth, each one participating, thus making it 100% for the drive. The average number of hours put in was 21. During this period the family were able to give 19,861 testimonies and place 10,163 pieces of literature: 4,139 bound books and 6,024 booklets. These were placed in 4,150 homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This exceeds anything the family has been able to do in the past, nnd is another evidence of the Lord’s blessing upon the effort of his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">peo</span><span class="font3">ple, makipg them more effective witnesses despite the hard .times and o tlier conditions that the adversary develops to hinder the Kingdom work. Each member of the family is grateful to the Lord for having this additional time to participate in the field service with the Lord’s people throughout the earth.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord Richly Blessed His People</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">560,250 Testimonies Given in 10 Days</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Another Record Smashed 12,141 Workers in the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The friends throughout, the earth have looked forward to the report of the results of the Watchtower Week with greater interest than for any other drive since service weeks were inaugurated. There were &gt;&nbsp;number of factors involved to create this interest. We were all interested in knowing how the four-book com bination for one dollar would go, what influence the radio had in placing the literature, and if there was any possible way of checking the de of these were very vital questions in the mind of. the “servant&quot;. Therefore it is with great joy, and with a deep sense of gratitude to the Lord, that we here submit the figures for this drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every branch of the service exceeded our greatest expectations. Classes, both English and foreign, sharpshooters, auxiliary and pioneer colporteurs, all did their part, and did it well. 'I lie total of testimonies did not quite come up to our expectation of 600,000, but they came mighty close to it. Tiie total for the entire drive was 560,250. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Of</span><span class="font3"> these, 122,192 resulted in literature placed in some form. The latter number represents the purchasers. This is a mighty witness, when we consider that over a half-million of the 20, 000,000 families in the United States received a testimony about the Lord and his kingdom during this drive. The number of hours put in by the workers exceeded anything that they had done in the past. There were 1.66,865 hours devoted to field service, each one averaging 13.74 hours. These were divided as follows : Class workers and sharpshooters, 9.12 hours; auxiliaries, 23.78 hours; and pioneers, 43.39 hours. The colporteurs more than exceeded their allotted quota, while the classes and sharpshooters almost made theirs. Viewed from every angle, this was a glorious week, and undoubtedly the same wonderful results obtained in tills country were obtained throughout the earth, because this witness is not of man’s accomplishment, but rather of the Lord’s directing, and is accomplished by his spirit. We know that you are anxious to know the results in books and booklets placed.</span></p>

Every branch of the service reached a peak never before reached as early in the spring, indicating that the Lord’s people are increasingly appreciating the issue that is before them, and with enthusiasm and joy they are devoting their faculties to Jehovah’s service in the vindication of his name.

We rejoice with all who had a part in this, because the Lord evidently blessed their efforts to his praise and glory. The classes and sharpshooters maintained a splendid booklet record also. In fact, one of the remarkable features of this drive was that the bound books increased without greatly diminishing the booklets.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Every One Who Can Will Attend</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Preparations Made for World wide Climax</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Undoubtedly the Columbus convention will be the high point of 1931’s activities. Every one who can possibly do so should attend. The object in attending is, not to sit around and listen to discourses only, but also to use our faculties in magnifying the name of Jehovah in doing whatever service he wants us to do at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the Columbus convention, as announced in the June 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">’Watch Tower,</span><span class="font3"> there will be a number of auxiliary conventions throughout the earth. Each of these will, as far as possible, be an echo of the Columbus convention, and they will be held July 31 to August 2. These auxiliary conventions, distributed throughout the United States, Canada, the British Isles, central Europe, Australia, South America and the isles of the sea, should bring to a climax the mightiest witness to the name of Jehovah ever given on the earth. Some of those in the United States who will be in the near.vicm-ity of the’ Columbus convention aiid will be served by regional service directors representing the Society are quoted .here for the convenience of the friends choosing their route to Columbus, So that they can arrange to have their tickets through one of these points and stay over from July 31 to August 2 and have part with the friends there In magnifying the name of Jehovah and carrying the enthusiasm and blessings which they receive a.t the convention to those at these points who were </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font3">fortunate enough to attend.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">If Definite Arrangements Are Made for Special Trains or Cars, Let Us Know</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Requests are coming into this office from different parts of the country for information regarding special trains or parties planning to travel together to the Columbus Convention. We have already received notice that the Chicago friends have arranged a special train over the Pennsylvania Railroad, leaving Chicago on Thursday, July 23, at 9: 00 a.m., Central Standard Timo. Friends desiring to use this train can communicate with A. L. Seeley, 6944 Eberhart Av., Chicago, III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pacific Coast friends hope to have a special train over the Union Pacific from Ogden, Utah, to Columbus. To use this train southern California friends may take the Southern Pacific via San Francisco or the Union Pacific direct to Ogden. The Portland friends may take the Oregon Short Line to Green River or Ogden. If from 100 to 123 (or more) friends plan to travel over this route, they</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">Those coming from the Northwest will, in all probability, obtain their tickets by way ol' Chicago and take advantage of the special rates suggested in the June 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower. </span><span class="font3">Therefore it will be convenient for them to spend the week-end at Chicago and join with the friends there in the auxiliary convention. Those coming from the Middle West should arrange for a stop-over at St. Louis or Indianapolis; and those from the Southwest, at Cincinnati. The friends going from the North and East:, both in the United States and in Canada, should arrange their routing so as to allow them a stopover at Detroit, Cleveland or Buffalo, while those coming from the Southeast and South have a choice of either Pittsburgh or Washington, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">D, C, </span><span class="font3">Keep these points In mind when obtaining your routing and arrange your return route so as to include one of these points and take in an auxiliary convention. Every provision for territory, halls and meetings will be prepared In advance, and Information regarding rooming accommodations,, parking and other details will be available at Colnmbus by representatives from each of these points who will come prepared to supply it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The friends throughout the* earth, are manifesting greater enthusiasm regarding the Columbus convention and the auxiliary conventions which are to follow' than has ever been manifested before. Germany has already scheduled its auxiliary conventions ; England and other countries have written us, telling us they are arranging to cooperate with the friends throughout the world in this mighty drive. If you cannot attend at Columbus, then do not miss one of these auxiliary conventions if you can possibly get to it.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">can arrange for special train at Ogden or Green River and go straight through to Columhus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Friends coining from Pacific Coast points will save considerablj' by using the “Summer Tourist” rates to Chicago. Arrangements will be made for a representative of the Pennsylvania Railroad to board the train before it reaches Chicago and sell tickets from Chicago to Columbus on the Identification Certificate Plan. Each delegate must have a certificate to secure the rate of fare and a half for the round trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Friends from southern California may communicate with Edw. Stark. 332 El Camino Drive, Beverly Hills. Calif. The friends from San Francisco and vicinity can get in touch with C. W. Gerdes, 01 Diamond St.. San Francisco, Calif. Those in Portland and vieinitv can communicate with W. 11.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Those at Columbus and Elsewhere</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Will Move as One Army</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">World-wide Convention W<sup>T</sup>eek, in which all the anointed throughout the entire earth will be able to have an active part, begins July 24 and continues until August 2. Think of it! A convention in which everyone can engage. Those at Columbus will be spending a good part of their time in the field work along with those who are unable to be at Columbus itself. Therefore, if you are a class worker, an auxiliary or a pioneer, the Lord is permitting you to have a real part in what we anticipate will turn out to be the greatest convention that has ever been held. The Lord has used his “faithful servant” to accomplish his purposes in the past. Without their realizing the fact that they were fulfilling divine prophecies, by joyfully obeying his commands they have been privileged to have a part with each of the “seven angels” in the ‘sounding of the seven trumps’. What does the Lord have in store for his people now? Well, time will tell; and if his people are joyful in obeying his commands thej- can have every assurance that he will continue to use them to the honor and praise of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore, everyone who loves the at night on the noted train called The Empire Builder. Friends along the line can use this train. Those planning to travel this way will please communicate with LI, G. Babcock, 938 16th North, Seattle, Wash., Chas. Harlin, P. O. Box 707, Wenatchee, Wash., or Isaac Hagen, E. 1728 10th Av., Spokane, Wash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">friends from Florida hope to secure a sufficient number of delegates to travel together to obtain a very low rate of fare. If the Florida friends will communicate with D. F. Johnson, 1618 Liberty St., Jacksonville, Fla., he will supply the necessary information and make arrangements for this special party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Friends from Virginia and North Carolina write us that they are planning a special party if they can secure enough to obtain either a special coach or a special train over tlie Norfolk &amp;&nbsp;Western. For further Information regarding this, communicate with D. IT. Selden, 3109 Floyd Av., Richmond, Va.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Friends from New Orleans and points north served by the Southern Railroad should communicate with W. W. Howell, Box 17, Hattiesburg, Miss., if they desire to join a party on tins route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If the various classes will inform us concerning arrangements they hope to make to attend the convention we shall be glad to publish this information in order that all the friends living along the various railroad lines may know the schedules of special parties and special trains en route to the convention. Please furnish this information as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lord will be particularly desirous of having as active a part as possible in this World-wide Convention. Remember, even jf you are not privileged to attend, you are not restricted from actively participating in the convention service. “Surprise Week” it. has been called, and surely It will be a surprise attack against Satan’s organization as the Lord’s anointed in convention assembled go forth shouting out their triumphant song of victory, the echoes of which will be heard throughout Satan's whole domain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who are unable to be at Columbus are being counted upon as much as those who are there to make this week the biggest, one ever held. We feel confident that those who cannot be there will be anxious to give every moment possible in the field work, lifting high the banner of truth. Pioneers, remember, though you are in some far-off sect ion of the country the Lord is looking to you to faithfully perforin your part. Auxiliaries, you too have an obligation before the Lord to fulfill. Class workers, where are you going to be during this momentous week?

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Rooming Accommodations at Colnmbus</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Get Your Blank from Director</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are enclosing with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font3">a good supply of “Accommodations” blanks, which the director should keep and give to any who anticipate going to the convention. If the friends fill out these “Accommodations’’ blanks in detail and forward them to the WATCHTOWER C O N V E N TI O N, ACCOMMODA-T1ONS COMMITTEE, Northern Hotel, 493 North High St., Columbus, Ohio, on or before July JO, an assignment of rooms will be made and all these details can be attended to before you arrive at the convention. Please go over the application blank carefully and then slate specifically what rooming accommodations you desire. You will greatly assist the Accommodations Committee if you will get these blanks to them early, so that their work can be completed before July 24, when the convention starts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Enthusiasm is running high throughout the entire country, and in other countries too. The Lord’s people are anxious to attend this convention and are making every effort to do so. Appreciating now how-much the Lord has used his people in previous conventions, we know that the Lord has a special blessing in store for those who will attend this one.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6">Tremendous Preparations Made for This Broadcast</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Directors Should Plan</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Work for Sunday Make Local Arrangement for</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Public to Listen In</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From Friday, July 24, to Sunday. August 2, will be one of those periods of time In which the friends will again put forth an extraordinary effort to sing forth the praises of Jehovah. During this week arrangements are being made throughout the world to tell the people of God’s kingdom and its establishment for their blessing. The first two days of this drive the friends throughout the country should make special effort to distribute as many as they can of the special radio folders announcing the big hook-up for July 26. Probably a little canvassing can be done during these two days, but the best part of the time, we believe, should be spent in the distribution of these folders announcing Brother Rutherford's talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On Sunday morning, July 26, all the workers throughout the land should make special effort to get out into the service and canvass with the literature. Arrangements should be made by the directors so that all the friends can return home or to some central meeting place to listen</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font6">Ten Million Radio Folders for July 26 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to Be Distributed by Workers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Society Will Furnish</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">These Free</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Wide Announcement of Lecture to Be Made</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is making extensive arrangements for the July 2G hookup, and It is believed now that the greatest combination of radio stations to date will be used in the broadcast of the lecture which will he given by Brother Rutherford on that occasion. Arrangements are under way so that three hundred or more stations, in North American countries and throughout the world, including Australia, Cuba, Alaska. France and other countries, will be broadcasting the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ten million special radio folders are being printed. This folder will contain the subject of the lecture, the list of stations used, and also the program for this one-hour broadcast. The folders will be supplied free of charge lo anyone who will take upon himself the obligation to see that they are distributed among the people. They can be had about July 1, and we shall be able to send them with your regular freight orders for books. Item ember, you should be stocking up about July 1. and when placing this large order for books, please order the special radio folder also. You may have as many of them as you will distribute in your territory, free of charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This radio program should bo widely advertised, so that all people will have an opportunity to hear God’s truth. Distribution should begin two weeks before the 26th, with your regular canvassing work. On ; the 24th and 25th of July all should j engage in the larger cities and towns. in on this one-hour special program. The program will begin at 12 o’clock noon, Eastern Standard Time, an ! continue until one o'clock. Friend;’ in the East can canvass only mu-about 11:30, Standard (or 12:30 Daylight Saving) Time, probably i:i territory near their meeting place, and then put in a few hours afterwards; whereas those in the Central, Mountain and Pacific Timo zones can probably arrange their canvassing parties for after the broadcast, so that they can go into the field service also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Arrangements should be made so that every one of the Lord’s people who can possibly listen in to this talk will have an opportunity to do so. It seems logical that after the Lord has made such extensive ar rangements to send this message to the people of the world the Lord’s people, above all, should be full;, acquainted with what is said, and should be able to refer to it during the succeeding service days. We fee’ sure the Lord has a wonderful blessing in store for the anointed at this time, as well as for the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We notice, in going from house to house In the canvassing, that many people do not use their radios durin:, the summer months, for one reaso: or another. This may be particularly</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At least 75 percent of the 10,006,000 should be put out in these two days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When you receive these radio folders you will notice that on the hack page is given a detailed outline of the program, and also the two songs that will be sung by the entire congregation at the Coliseum. All the friends, everywhere, can join in these songs of praise to Jehovah. The friends, especially those who are coming to the convention, should practice these songs so that when this broadcast takes place the songs will be pleasing to the listeners. The Lord has great things in store for his people, and they should be enthused as never before to carry on the great work he has given them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Catalogs Can Be Had Again</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society lias reprinted the catalog, which we have supplied to many of the classes at 24 cents each, or two for five cents. If you have not received a sufficient number of these because of the smalt supply on hand at the Society’s office, you can now order some more. However, we remind you that these are not to be given out promiscuously as free advertising, but should be used by the friends as a kind of prospectus. Many have found them a help in the work. We ask the director, in his ordering these catalogs, not to have more than two for each class worker. We are furnishing these to the classes only as an accommodation to the workers. The main reason for publishing these attractive catalogs is to supply those who are interested in the truth as a result of the radio lectures. We have found them to he a very splendid tiling. true this summer, because of 1 lie hard times. We therefore recommend that each class, through its director, Investigate and see what can be done about installing loudspeakers in some prominent place to deliver Brother Rutherford's lecture. In the South particularly, where there is a small percentage of radios, every class should try to have some arrangement whereby the people may be able to listen to the message. Local dealers may be approached with the proposition, telling them you will mention in your local advertising that the radio used was loaned for the occasion by courtesy of such, and such a dealer. If some of these radios could be installed In public parks, grand stands or any other outdoor place where public gatherings are accustomed to assemble, It would give a splendid witness. If an outdoor arrangement cannot be made, an effort should be made to get an auditorium where an instrument could be installed and the people invited to listen in. However, in the summertime the outdoor arrangement would be preferable, provided you can obtain a good, strong loud-speaker. Of course, if any arrangement such as this is undertaken, it should be thoroughly advertised in the local newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventioners Asked Not to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Canvass En Route to Columbus Without Having V<sup>;</sup> &lt;1 Un.',&gt;•■&lt;&gt;/««• A■■Go'nTM.crt of Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jls the time approaches for the Columbus convention, July 24 to 30, friends throughout the country are making preparations to go. They will be coming by every conceivable mode of travel. It is therefore important for all of those who are traveling to bear in mind certain things which will be in the real interests of the work and of those through whose territory you may be passing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Heretofore, many complaints have been received from colporteurs and other workers about someone’s just working in their territory without their having any knowledge of the fact until they themselves have come to cover the assignment. This has oftentimes proved to be very discouraging to the party who has received the territory in the usual way, and sometimes has meant that a colporteur has traveled miles to get to a place only to find that someone on route to a convention has just covered the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some of the friends have the desire to work en route to the convention, in the hope of making part of their expenses. Colporteurs have found that when they have had a very long journey to take it is much more satisfactory to get special assignments of territory from the Society, at intervals of several hundred miles, drive direct to their first assignment, to which they have had some books shipped in advance, spend several weeks there, and then drive direct to their next location. In this way they have been able to place many more books, and those which they have not been able to place in their first assignment they have had forwarded on to their next territory; which has made it mi-necessary to carry a lot of heavy luggage. This is carrying on the work in an orderly manner. It assures that no hardship will be worked on any other worker who may have received a special assignment in an orderly manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We therefore ask the friends not to do any regular door-to-door canvassing while traveling en route to the convention. If you want to leave a witness behind you, there would be no objection to your carrying with you a supply of the radio folders advertising the weekly programs or advertising the big hook-up which will take place on the first Sunday of the convention. This would be an aid to the party working the territory, rather than a hindrance, and, we feel confident, would not be ob-jeefed to by any of the workers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Order Literature Now</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Stock Up with Big Supply</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Factory Closed July 24 to August 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As announced in the June 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font3"> the vacation of the Bethel family will begin July 24 and terminate August 8. During this period there will be no mail opened or shipments of any kind made; consequent-ly all should endeavor to have their orders for such literature as they require for the special “Surprise and during the Bethel vaca-llAjiL pUl iOti 4J-* IV VJ 1 u-tlAji LiCw.&quot; t-’-L &lt;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;x Saturday, July 18, at the very latest. That will enable us to fill and ship these orders during the early part of the following week, before the factory closes for the vacation period. This applies to class directors, sharpshooters, auxiliaries and pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We especially request also that di-'ectors and colporteurs, in sending in their weekly reports, use the United States postal card which is forwarded to them for that purpose, and not enclose these report cards in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font3">envelope. Otherwise these will be held up in the regular mail until the office force gets around to opening it; whereas if they are sent separately they can be sorted immediately and wo can begin working and compiling the different reports as soon as the office force returns. Your cooperation in this respect will greatly aid us in getting out the report of this special drive week and also the report for the month of July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Continued from page 2, column 4} make it an outstanding week for the number of hours devoted to the work. That will mean more testimonies given than ever before, and more literature placed to the honor of Jehovah's name. It can be done, by the Lord’s grace, as each one diligently does his part. If during the last service week you gave 43 hours to the field service, carefully and prayerfully watch your time to see if you can personally squeeze in a few more hours. If you gave 12 hours, perhaps by careful planning you can find a few more moments. We suggest this for your own interest as well as the interests of the work in general; for what greater privilege could there possibly be than to share with God’s people in carrying out his purposes?</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font6">Why Did the Testimonies per Hour Drop?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Three Reasons Suggested and Well to Consider</span></h4>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>4 for $1.00</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>and Workers Enthusiasm Was Irresistible to Public</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">There are a few observations which we should like to make, covering the analysis of this week’s figures. The average number of testimonies per hour during this drive was 3.51, or 31 testimonies each hour per worker. This is the lowest average of testimonies per hour we have had since we started compiling testimonies. Naturally the Question arises, Why should this be? There are about three possible answers to it. The first is that in a great many cases the people are interested in the message of tlie Kingdom that we have but because of their financial condition are unable to purchase. Therefore they are anxious to know more about it and they ask questions relating to the work and the proof and evidence of the Kingdom, and the workers feel that they must remain longer in the homes to explain the matter to them, seeing there is no possibility of placing the literature under tile circumstances, This, of course, means more time spent with the people. There are other people who are in difficulty and have trouble and are anxious to talk to the workers about their troubles but who are not particularly interested in the panacea that the Kingdom holds for them. They want to tell yon what they want to do abont these conditions. Oftentimes the workers spend considerable Lime with these people and reaiiy acedia?' plisb nothing beyond listening to their troubles and their plans. While the time spent with the first class would undoubtedly be well spent and result in sowing seeds of interest that would ultimately bear fruit by those people obtaining the literature, In practically every case the time spent with the latter class is wasted and is only holding up the worker from going to someone who wants to hear about the Kingdom and its blessings. All workers should therefore carefully check up to see whether they are actually accomplishing anything by spending very much time in talking to the people, and in cases where there is no interest in the Kingdom and no possibility of placing any literature, they shonld hurry on to the next house and continue the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second reason for the small number of testimonies per hour maybe the fact that the friends were working rural territory which was sparsely settled, thus requiring more time to reach a given number of people. The third reason might be that the interest of the people in the Kingdom message is diminishing. However, every evidence indicates that this latter answer cannot be true, because the Bible itself clearly indicates that this Kingdom shall grow and grow until it fills the whole earth; and the fact that despite the hard times and everything else the magnitude of the message increases is a definite proof of an increasing interest In the Kingdom message on the part of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore, of the three possible causes, the first is probably the most responsible for holding down the number of testimonies, because all the workers find that the people today are intensely interested and that where they cannot afford to purchaw the literature they want the friends to teil them all they*possibly can about the Kingdom work. This op portunity of comforting the. people should not be neglected; the main thing is to see that those who are being witnessed to are being told about the Kingdom and interested in hearing about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We believe, too, that the second proposition was considerably in evidence (luring this drive. After the long winter, working in city territory, the friends are anxious to avail themselves of the first opportunity to get out into the rural territory and work, and because the territory is scattered it necessarily pulls flows their percentage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another point to be noted is that the placements per hour for this drive were .78. This is the lowest that we have ever reached. However, this is not. because of the fact that the friends are presenting the bound books, but is due to the low number of testimonies per hour, for the number of testimonies per purchaser is practically the same as it was during the Midwinter drive, when we placed only 25,000 books. During the Midwinter drive one placement was made for every 4.4 testimonies. During this Watchtower drive one placement was made out of every 4.5 testimonies, so that the difference is only 1/10 of one testimony, which would have very little influence on the total. However, this fact proves one very important point. That is, that the reason the bound books were not placed more effectively in the past was that they were not offered with enthusiasm by the workers themselves. The fact that it made a difference of only 1/10 of one testimony in the testimonies per placement du:Ing Watchtower Week, when we hud the largest number of books we ever placed, is a proof that the people will take the book combinations if these are stressed and properly presented by the friends. Of course, the fact that the people were offered four books for one dollar, when previously- they were getting only three, w-ould have considerable bearing upon the results. However, we believe, too, that when the friends themselves recognized the wonderful offer they had for the people, of fonr for a dollar, they became so enthusiastic that their offer became irresistible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Continued from page 1, column 4) number of combinations was 12,292, and in these combinations there were 50,311 books. In other words, over 50,000 of the 70,000 bound books were placed in combinations. This Indicates that despite the hard times arid every other thing the Devil has used to impede the progress of the Kingdom work, the Lord’s work increased with leaps and bounds, and the bound books can be placed if the friends get enthusiastically behind It.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Regarding the effect of the radio in placing the literature: We find that a great many of the directors apparently misunderstood what was required in that respect, because they have given us everything but the information required, many of them showing the percentage of people listening to the radio, or something else. What we actually wanted and asked for was the number of people who purchased the literature because of something they heard over the radio regarding it. We cannot give you anything like an accurate summary of the effect of the radio on the field work at the present time. We have written the classes reporting incorrectly and expect to have the Information in the next </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Plan Field Territory for “Surprise Week”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Every class throughout the United States should commence now and definitely plan and prepare their territory for &quot;Surprise Week”. While the center of attack will be at Columbus and vicinity, every class in the country is expected to participate in the field service during this drive. Where the director anticipates attending Columbus, some other competent brother should be appointed to look after the work at home and lead those friends into the field activities who are unable to go to Columbus. Plans should be made to have field activity every day from 8: 00 a.m. until 2: 00 p.m., commencing Monday, July 27, up to and including Sunday, August 2. Special arrangements for Sunday, July 26, are treated in another part of this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin;</span><span class="font3"> consequently the territory to be worked should be carefully chosen, arrangements should be made to have transportation for the workers, depots where literature will be obtainable convenient to the territory -worked, and every other provision to make this a real witness in each local territory.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Regarding the Reports for “Surprise Week”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Service directors and colporteurs, both auxiliary and pioneer, will arrange to close their reports for the week before the drive week, Thursday night, July 23, and commence the drive week report with Friday, July 24, and close it Sunday night, August 2. The weekly report following drive week will therefore commence with Monday, August 3. In due course a special report will be forwarded to the sharpshooters, and they are to include in that report the dates mentioned above; namely, from Friday, July 24, until Sunday, August 2,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Continued from page 1, column 1) to work with such a band of God’s people, and this company manifestly had Jehovah’s blessing, as evidenced by the wonderful results of the effort the colporteurs made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The number of workers taking part in this campaign was the greatest in the history of the colportenrs. 1,313 pioneers and 837 auxiliaries reported, making a total of 2,150 in the colporteur army during Watchtower Week. 56,074 hours were put in the field by the pioneers, and 19,876 by the auxiliaries. Because they realized more than ever that they were not engaged in a bookselling campaign, hut were carrying the message of God’s kingdom, the average number of hours which the pioneers canvassed was 43.39. The average number of hours in the field for auxiliaries was 23.74, which Ims never before been equaled. Thus with more workers willing to work harder, and with Jehovah's blessing upon their efforts, the colporteur army constitutes an army against the Devil and his organization, the like of which has never before gone forth in the history of God’s people on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The 70,489 books placed by the pioneers is only 7,090 less than placed during the entire month of April. During the ten days of the Watchtower Week the auxiliaries placed 6,815 more bound books than during the entire month of April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The zeal which the colporteurs have for the King and the Kingdom is manifested by the fact that they gave the testimony to 243,921 persons in the short period of ten days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gan books he placed? Is it possible that the Lord’s people, in spile of financial conditions, depression, unemployment and these other ills afflicting mankind, can place with the people bound books containing the message of God’s kingdom? It seems that the answer to that is found in the report for Watchtower week. We are all interested in the combinations of 4 books, and we see that pioneers and auxiliaries placed 11,126 of these with the people. Of the 70,489 books placed by pioneers, 52,136 were in combinations of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i </span><span class="font3">books or more. During April there were 1,844 nine-book combinations left by the pioneers and auxiliaries ; and during Watchtower Week, 1,537. It is very gratifying to see the large number of combinations placed during these ten days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At a time when many of those in the field meet with extreme poverty while canvassing the people, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord </span><span class="font3">has blessed us with the drive just passed, and to those who have gone forward in obedience to instructions they have received, he lias given assurance that he is on their side. Three of the outstanding features of Watchtower Week, so far as the colporteur activities are concerned, are, first, the number responding to call for special service, which is greater than ever before; the average number of hours which these put in actual field canvassing because of their zeal for the King and his kingdom; and the remarkable way in which the books have gone to the people because of their enthusiastic presentation to the people by the workers. Those who have taken their stand unreservedly on Jehovah’s side as colporteurs and are pressing forward in the work to the honor of Jehovah’s name have every cause for rejoicing. It has been proven that all things that Jehovah does for his people arc for their good. Those who have responded to the call to service in the manner in which pioneers and auxiliaries have during this campaign may continue to press on during tlie Sum mer months that are ahead of us. continuing to make the Kingdom message the one big work in their lives and thus bring delight to the heart of the God whom they serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers—Do not Plan to Get County Territory Assignments at the Convention </span><span class="font3">Heretofore, some of the pioneer colporteurs have attended the big general conventions expecting to make arrangements while there for territory to which to return after the convention. Do not plan to do this at Columbus, but have all your arrangements made prior thereto. Territory arrangements can be handled much more satisfactorily through correspondence than through ■ personal interviews at a convention, when there are so many other tilings to be looked after. For this reason, colporteurs are asked to hear in mind that pioneer territory will not be assigned at Colnmbus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There </span><span class="font3">are more pioneers on the list now than ever before, and we are expecting the greatest representation of pioneers as well as auxiliaries that any convention has ever seen. As far as possible, let’s get details handled before the convention, so that this period can be devoted to doing the work at band which the Lord has for us to do.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>A Suggestion</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Those handling radio matters please check up the list on the back of the June 15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower.</span><span class="font3"> If any changes are made in the time please report promptly to the radio department.</span></p>

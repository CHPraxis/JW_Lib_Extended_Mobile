<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Don’t Forget the Special Information Required</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">“Midwinter Week” proved to be n great witness to the name of Jehovah, and now tlie time has come to give earnest and prayerful consideration to “Watchtower Week&quot;. May 8 to 17 are to be tlie ten days set aside for the anointed throughout. the earth to lift their voices in singing &quot;its it were a new song before the throne, and before Ilie four boasts, Mild the elders”. (Rev, 14; 3) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> says concerning this new song, ‘Tlie song which John lienrd sounds new, :ind therefore would indicate thril the servant class would have a change in their witness work from that of Elijah to Unit foreshadowed by Elisha, the la I ter being a service attended with no fear but willi great Joy. It is the love of God that prompts them to service, and the love such as Christ 1ms that constrains Ibem and bolds them together; and these fear not the enemy or his organization, but boldly sing fortli the praises of the great Eternal One. . . . The time lias come for them to sing, and they do ‘sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise from tlie end of the etirlli’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And then goes on to show that the remnant here on earth arc not to be alone in their singing. Maybe you arc n pioneer in some remote section of the country where few nppreeiiile the fact that you lire faith fully doing your best to serve Jeliovali, or perImps you are a sharpshooter isolated from all other friends in lite trulli. Yet you do not stunil alone in singing forth Jehovah’s praises. All over the earth during this week tlie anointed will be putting forth a special effort to get in more time, that the strains of this new song might lie heard far and wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Besides your brethren on earth who arc singing, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">T.ifjht</span><span class="font2"> tells us: “The angelic hosts sang to the praise of Jehovah Cod nt the birth of Jesus, wlioni they announced as tlie Savior of the world. Now tlie King in glory slands upon Mount Zion witli all power and authority to rule and Wess, and all of God’s organization join in the new song. The angels in heaven and the remnant on earth sing before tlie throne the praises of rhe Most High. The singers have the throne, and not who they are. in mind. The singers are mil tlie important ones: it is I he great JeliOvnh God, and Ids King, whose praises they sing. In the grand chorus Ilie 1.44,01X1 are ‘singing before the four beasts’; which means they are singing in the presence and hearing of Jehovah’s organization. . . , All who are of the 144.000 must sing now, and they do sing. Tlie singing in the hearing of rill of God’s organization implies that the remnant on earth must now be singing us their theme God’s supremacy in the throne, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font2">his word mid his name might bo made known and in due time fully vindicated.’’— I’ages 308-310, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Book 1. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How good tlie Lord Ims been to his people to permit them to have a little part in this great chorus I Who is there among the anointed that will not be straining every nerve to do His little part during “Watchtower Week&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I’o make “Watchtower Week” a big success, remember that the spe eial features are the recording of the number of those who obtain literature who listen </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to the </span><span class="font2">Watch Tower radio programs and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">num</span><span class="font2">ber who do not. Also remember that the elothboinid books are to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font2">stressed in the $1.00 combinations. How to report placements, and the combiiuifions Io be stressed, are explained elsewhere, in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Iliilletin, </span><span class="font2">Territory should be carefully outlined by Ilie class directors in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">small towns, as suggested in the March </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">liHlletln.</span><span class="font2"> so that the work ciin lie carried on smoothly and all unnecessary delays avoided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tile brethren al. headquarters </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font2">lieve this “Watchtower Week&quot; to he so important that they are closing down for Ilie first three days so that they might do their </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">part </span><span class="font2">in leaving rhe witness in the hands of I he people. Time in the field work is that which results in giving the testimonies and in leaving </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the books </span><span class="font2">with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">people. More time in the Held means more witnesses given, more hooks placed in tile hands </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">i he people, stud more blessings both given and received. Let each one nmke arrangements now for putting in as much time as possible during “Watchtower Week”.</span></p>

In 1111s country special stress will be laid upon the keeping of a record of die number of persons who obtain the literature who arc listeners to the Watch Tower radio programs. Don't forget to place an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">K</span><span class="font2"> al'ler each placement made when it has been made as a result of the radio. Then each worker, service director, sharpshooter and colporteur, should report the total number of obtainers who have listened to the Walch Tower and the total obtainers who have not listened to the Watch Tower. Show it on your worker’s slip or report card in the column headed: &quot;5um-ber of persons obtaining literature” like this: </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;"><sup>25 R</sup></span><span class="font2">- By drawing a line I 25</span></p>

Class directors, colporteurs and sharpshooters should make out their reports to include nil the work done for the entire period of ten days beginning witli the Sill and ending with tlie 1.7th. As moidhly reports only are usually required from the sharpshooters, a special curd will be sent to them for reporting activities during “Watchtower Week”. Their monthly report for May will represent their activities during the remainder of the month.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Don't forget to mention the Watch Tower in each canvass and ask if the Wateh Tower programs arc listened to.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Letter or Phone Call Once in a While Will Help</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah surely is preparing the way for a steadily increasing testimony by means of the transcription broadcasting. An occasional word of encouragement, either by letter or telephone (immediately following broadcast), will mean much to hearten the men nt the station, who themselves are doubtless harassed by Satan and his sons. Such encouragement is especially timely when a “hot” shot has gone out over the air. Each one will, we are sure, thoroughly sense the value of tliis privilege of service and use it diligently.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Society Publishes New Catalog</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">To Be Mailed to All Interested Radio Listeners</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Workers May Find Them Useful in Canvassing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society has just published a 36-page catalog describing all the late publications. In it there is a very beautiful colored illustration of the nine books giving a view of the bricks of the entire set as it looks standing between book ends, and another giving a full front view of each book separately. 'There is a third illustration, showing ah the ten-cent booklets. The main reason for the publication of this very attractive catalog is to give detailed information to the radio listeners who write in to this office for more Information in regard to the books <sup>1 </sup>which are announced over the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For a long time the friends have i been desirous of some prospectus or I colored illustration that can be used to show all Ilie books without carrying the entire set of nine with them. Some of the sisters and elderly brethren cannot always carry a full sei. and a supply of booklets. We therefore believe tlmt this catalog will be of help to these friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was quite an expense to the Society to publish this catalog, and therefore we are offering them al cost to the friends who desire to use them. Two of the catalogs may be had for live cents; or, in other words, they are ecnls each. Wc are enclosing a catalog with this | </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Unllelin,</span><span class="font2"> for your examination ; and I if any of the friends desire them, please have Hie director order a quantity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This catalog may answer the request of many of the brethren for an attractive illustration of the books. Some have asked for a pro spectus, but it would bo very expensive to get these up. If the brethren find the use of this catalog an aid in placing the books, we shall be glad to have you write us liow you use it and what results are obtained. 'this may be of help to other workers,</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Many Friends Like Them</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have quite u few Inquiries at this office about what is known as a “Golfers Pal&quot;. This “Golfers Pal&quot; is a very neat uickel-plated counter with a small knob on one side that can he pushed in each time a testimony is given, which is then registered. It is worn on the wrist as a wristwatch is worn. It will be found a convenience in keeping track of your testimonies, especially in winter mouths. So many have been I he inquiries that we have made investigation with the people who manufacture this “Golfers Bal&quot;. Il retails ;il one dollar in all sporting goods stores. If we buy a large quantity at one lime we Khali be able to furnish them to the friends at sixty cents each. If we can get a sufficient number of orders from the friends, we shall be able to supply them at this price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">CANVASSING CASE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Cor the convenience of the friends the Society will handle a very neat canvassing case. If the Society buys these in large quantities they can lie furnished Io any of tlie .friends for $2,150 each. A picture of the case is given below. It is lined with red waterproof cloth, and entirely covered with fnhrikold leal her, It is a strongly built case and has a lull-length piano hinge. Tlie case will hold eleven clothbomid books and four booklets or nine clothbound books and eighteen booklets. If any of the friends desire such u ease the Society will handle just one order for them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">We should appreciate it it each uirvice director would take this matter up with tlie class and have all those who want one of these nr both to place their orders with him, and please pay him in advance. Each director should take the orders mi a separate sheet of paper for his record, and then mail an order for the total quantity to this office, stating the number of “Golfers Pal” and canvassing cases you require for the class and enclosing remitlance in full with the order. It' colporteurs desire these, please send in order with remittance. We will hold these orders for n while before we place an order with the manufacturers. We will place one large order and then discontinue handling these testimony counters and canvassing * i-iiHes. The reason we are doing It this time is tlmt we can save the friends a good bit of money. Please lie sure that your order is in ' before April 20, because the number wc have orders for at that time will be ordered from the inanuftie-liirers. Any orders received thereafter will very likely not be filled.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">By tlie Court Mock, TJ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Oscar Burke was found guilly in rhe police court of the City of Warren, under tin a Hida vit lliat, charged ih.it: he unlawfully went “about from place to place upon the streets of said city&quot; to solicit orders for books without having obtained a license so to do. coni vary to a given ordiimnee of i lie City. Tlie judgment nf conviction was affirmed in the Common J'leus Court and he now prosecutes error io Ibis Court, to reverse both of tlie judgments referred to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Ordinance invoked against the accused is not one of perfect r'liirily but we do not deem it necessary to place tiny in I erprelation on its terms. If Burke was soliciting orders for books at the time charged, tlie books which lie sought Io dispose of were of religious nature. Burke had no financial interest in tin’ sale of them. It is agreed that under another section of the City Ordinance one soliciting orders of this character is immune from prosecution if bis solicitation was in fact done for church or religious purposes. Whether the publishing house that furnished these books was conducting a business for profit is riot apparent. It is, however, perfectly apparent that so far as Burke was concerned, he was engaged In a religious mission, that the work he was doing was solely of a religions nature and was for the benefit of the church with which he is affiliated. It is not. therefore necessary to determine whether under this Ordinance he would have been guilty if lie had heen engaged in soliciting orders from which he was to profit. It Is only necessary to say that the evidence clearly shows that he was entitled to immunity afforded him by the Ordinance last referred to. Because the judgment is nmnifesily opposed to the weight nf the testimony the «;imc is reversed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">None of your radio listeners have heard a word about booklets, and are not expecting them. They do know about the books, and are expecting them. In his lectures Brother Hiii.lierford impresses upon them the importance and necessity of the books. Are we going to undo Ills work by rccauvassing for booklets after they have already been told of books and are expecting them? Of course we are not, We are going to be consistent. We are going to raise our voice and with the voice together sing one harmonious song to the praise of Jehovah. Books, Book's, and more Books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Viewing the matter from another angle, here is what we find. Under ordinary conditions, when business is good, the majority of the people are pretty well satisfied with conditions and therefore more argument is required to cause them to realize ilieir need of Ilie Kingdom. There is no question in the mind of any intelligent person today regarding the conditions in the world. They know there is something wrong. They know they can’t remedy it. They know none of the human organizations are able to cope with it, and they want to know the correct answer. We have it in the books. They should have the books. Why offer that which only partly on ers the issue, when you have the books? The harder the times, the greater is tlie need for the books. The Lord, knowing this condition, has provided food for his people in greater abundance than ever before and lias provided us with better books at a very low price for the feeding of the people.

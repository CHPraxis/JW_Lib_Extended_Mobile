</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord Is Leading His People into Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Notice and Warning Must Be Given</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During Testimony Week, November 7-15, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> book Is to be offered to the people, wit-h the, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom,</span><span class="font4"> booklet, for 40c. The significance and importance of placing these two latest publications with the people ns speedily as possible cannot be overstated. The message they contain is of vital importance to the rulers and the people now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The experiences of Jehovah's witnesses during the past two months in serving notice upon the rulers and the people concerning the expressed purposes of Jehovah have developed a directness and aggressiveness in the Kingdom work, undoubtedly directed by Jehovah himself, never before undertaken, and this should be maintained throughout our future activity. Our activities, however, are not to be limited to the serving of this notice upon the rulers and the people and ’announcing God’s judgments, already written, against the &quot;man of sin” and others who have defamed the Most High, but, in addition, a very important message is to be carried to the people now. The world is facing the greatest distress of all times; Armageddon is impending. Some people will* be shielded, protected, carried through the trouble and blessed because of their obedience to the Lord’s requirements. The Lord lays upon his witnesses the responsibility of carrying the message of his requirements to these people. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> contains this message in a very particular manner. No one who has read the book and made a careful study of it. with the Scriptures can have a shadow of douht in his mind regarding this. The third chapter of Ezekiel emphasizes the responsibility resting upon Jehovah’s witnesses to see that tins message is carried to the people that those of good will may hove an opportunity of embracing the Lord’s provision for their deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we consider the very remarkable way in which the Lord, during the past year, arranged for the campaign work performed by his anointed, we are convinced that Testimony Week follows most logically the Columbus Convention and Witness Week. On those occasions the Lord’s notice to the rulers and the people was presented and served upon them and undoubtedly opened the way where the Lord’s people can unitedly carry the message of God's organization contained in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> book, which shows his judgments upon those who oppose his kingdom and bls arrangement for the blessing of the people of good will. And with that very evident. assurance of the Lord’s overruling, each one of the anointed will with joy desire to enter into this campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font4">booklet for 40c make a most desirable combination, well within the reach of everyone. Present it with the same confidence, dignity and directness that you presented the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet alone and there is not any doubt about the people’s being Impressed arid taking it. In fact, if anything, this combination should be presented with even greater enthusiasm and assurance because of tire fact that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication.</span><span class="font4"> added to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet makes it a most important message for the people, and should be presented as such. Who knows how many of those who lake this combination from you will be thus, marked in their foreheads and pass through the time of Armageddon?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Brother Rutherford feels that tills coming Testimony Week drive is so Important that he has arranged to close the Bethel home and the factory for both ends of the drive, so as to permit the Bothel family to have part in this testimony which must now be given from door to door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bethel home, office </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">factory will be closed on Saturday and Sunday, November 7 and 8, and on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, November 1,3, 14 and 15 to enable all the family to have at least five whole days in the field service with the rest of the brethren Ihroughout the earth </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">addition to the evening work they will be able to do wit bin t he week, This poinf should be kept in mind when sending in orders for literature.

<p><span class="font4">hi a previous </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> it was mentioned that no consignments will be made of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> book. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">All </span><span class="font4">companies, colporteurs and auxiliaries should place orders early, so that: all will have them in time for Testimony Week, November 7 to 15 inclusive. Remember this, week Is set aside exclusively for the distribution of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vin dication</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font4">booklet. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> 35c each ; with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet, 40c.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Companies desiring the service of the Bethel brethren within a radius of about &lt;300 miles from Bethel will be supplied as usual. The Bethel brethren will lead- the friends in the field service, and will give one talk or service meeting each day, with the possible exception of Saturday, November .14, when it may be preferable in many cases for the friends to devote the late afternoon and evening to w<sup>r</sup>ork around the home, in preparation for Sunday field service. Every company desiring such service should write immediately, so that arrangements may be made and you may be notified well in advance. In sending in an application for Bethel brethren to serve your company, please address used during this campaign. Each one of Jehovah’s witnesses connected with cither the large or the small companies of his people, and isolated brethren, should put in at least </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10 </span><span class="font4">hours, or give 50 testimonies, during the drive. Ail of Jehovah’s witnesses in the pioneer and auxiliary </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">col</span><span class="font4">porteur branches of the Lord’s army should average al least 40 and 20 hours each, or 200 and 100 testimonies each, respectively, for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">drive.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">It was noted that in territory wlierft the friends used the method of presentation recommended by Brother Rutherford in the September </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> they obtained much better results than those who did not, and this is only what is to be expected. That method of presentation is clear, concise, direct and dignified. It placed the facts in the proper relationship to each other, so that the prospect could easily get your point. It placed the Kingdom witness work in a dignified position in the minds of those who listened to the presentation, lifting It out of the realm of canvassing, high pressure salesmanship, or any other method that might endeavor to take advantage of the people and leave them something that they did not understand or want. ’The time has come for all such methods to be put away , by Jehovah’s witnesses. He says to his witnesses, “Speak with my words unto them”; and again, “Tell them, Thus saith Jehovah.” Therefore it is imperative that, the Lord's witnesses, when testifying to the people, present themselves as witnesses of Jehovah, acting according to his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The words “canvass”, “canvasser” and “canvassing&quot; should never be used by the Lord's witnesses from this time forth. We are not canvassers in any sense of the word. We are witnesses of Jehovah God. In numerous places there are notices put up prohibiting canvassers, peddlers and solicitors of all sorts. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font4">we present ourselves as any of these, of necessity the notice applies </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">us; but we are none of these. We are witnesses for Jehovah God, carrying his message to the people. Therefore the words “canvass”, “canvasser&quot; and &quot;canvassing” should be replaced by the words “witness”, “witnesses,” “witnessing” and “witnessed” and “testify”, “testimony&quot; and “testimonies”. These are Scriptural terms and are associated with the new’ name that Jehovah has named for his people. Consequently, each one who is one of . Jehovah’s witnesses should discard any of the former expressions which in any associated the Lord’s people commercial anti vit les.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The stockkeeper will make out ail orders for literature as may be required, using the regular </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">company order blank</span><span class="font4"> printed especially for this purpose, and hand the order to the director for his approval. The director will send in the order to the Society. Always place orders : for at least one hundred pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">LITERATURE IS NOT TO BE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">STAMPED</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Books and booklets are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font4"> to he stamped with the name and address of the company, nor with any other information. Neither should any circular or card be inserted unless such insertion has been approved by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SERVICE TREASURER</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I The service treasurer will have charge of all money received from the distribution of the literature shipped to the company by the Society. The service committee will make up the account once a month, and each month the service treasurer, as the representative of the company, will pay for all literature placed during the month, turning the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">money order</span><span class="font4"> over to the director to forward to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">COMPANY BOOK ACCOUNT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It Is the privilege, and to the convenience, of the company to avail itself of the Society's credit arrangement for campaign literature. Each company whose account Is in good condition may order as much literature on account as may be required, making remittance therefor as placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An account is considered to be in good condition when the company remits once each month for the cost value of the literature disposed of within that period of time; in poor condition when the company fails to remit ut least once within three months, due to inactivity or any other reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A failure to remit at least once within three months automatically places the company on the suspended credit list. No credit will be allowed such a company until proper remittance is made. Each company should therefore endeavor to follow the rule of remitting onee a month for the literature placed; small companies, at the very least once in three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each month a statement of rhe company account is forwarded to tlie company In care of the director. It is the special duty of the service committee to examine this statement of the condition of the company aceount. Further, the service committee shall give to the company, through its service treasurer, an account of the amount of money that has been remitted to the Society during the month, the cost value of the books still in stock, and the amount of money on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The last two items should be sufficient to balance the amount due the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is the duty of the director to bring lo the attention of the com-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">In order to be able io properly maintain a “company service arrangement”, there should be, o-t </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the very least,</span><span class="font4"> four members who can AVERAGE at least three workers in the field witness service working a total of nine hours </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a week.</span><span class="font4"> Companies unable to meet this minimum re- ' quirement should organize under the I sharpshooter arrangement’. The sharpshooter arrangement has the same status as that of a “company”, with the exception that the responsibility of directing the witness work is placed upon one individual, and not upon a committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THE TWO PARTS OF A COMPANY </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">service organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The two parts are the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">workers </span><span class="font4">and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">service committee.</span><span class="font4"> The workers are those consecrated osies who take an active part in the witness service, and upon them depends to a very large extent the measure of success of the plans of action. The service committee consists of the service director, the stockkeeper, and the service treasurer. (In a small company, the director may serve as stockkeeper also, but the position of service treasurer is to be held by another member Of the company aud is not to be combined with any other office in the service committee.) It is the responsibility of the service committee to formulate the plans of witnessing in conformity io the general instructions received from Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SERVICE DIRECTOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The director is appointed by the Society and serves as its representative. He is also the representative of the company, Inasmuch as he is chosen by the Society upon the recommendation of the company. He is therefore a servant of both the company and the Society. His duties are twofold. His responsibility to the company is that of directing its witness activities in the territory assigned to it: and his responsibility to the Society is that of carrying out the instructions he receives from the office from time to lime through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers. linl-Ic.tto*,</span><span class="font4"> letters, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">STOCKKEEPER</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The stoekkeeper will have charge of all the supplies of literature furnished by the Society for tlie witness work. It is the duty of the stoekkeeper to keep full and accurate account of the stock committed to his care. All supplies for the witness work will be obtained from the stoekkeeper. The best course to follow is for the workers to pay cash for all books obtained from the stoekkeeper. Credit may lie extended to such workers as cannot advance the money for tbe books, witb the understanding that it is the duty of the service treasurer to collect from them the price of the books as they are placed, and, in case the worker becomes inactive, to notify the stoekkeeper, who will iiquest he return of the books that have</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">patiy all instructions and commut'd- ] cations from the Society at the first possible opportunity, so that tlte company may know what each worker should do to give the most effective witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ail correspondence of the service committee with the Society is to be done by and through the director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Promptly each week the director Is to see that a report of the company witness activities is sent to the Society, on the regular weekly report card. This, regardless of whether there lias been any witness work done or not. Workers are to make prompt and accurate reports of their activities to the director each week, using the regular weekly-worker’s report slips supplied for this very purpose.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">OTHER POINTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Workers only should have it vote in the witness plans to be undertaken by them. It depends upon them to carry out the plans, and therefore they should be the ones to determine what course of action is to be adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All who vote on service matters indicate by so doing that they intend to actively participate iu the witness work, and the director Is therefore justified in assigning all such a portion of territory and to expect reports of activities from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the event that the director should be unable, neglect, fall or refuse to carry out the instructions of the Society, the workers should bring the matter to the attention of the company and to the Society as soon as possible. It is hoped hat this action will not be necessary, but the witness work in any company should not be hampered by inattention of the director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Neither the service committee nor any member of it Is authorized to involve Che company in any financial obligation without first getting the consent of the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Literature is to be placed at tbe price fixed by the Society, and workers should offer literature at that price, known as the retail or public price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">COMPANY WORKERS' BOOKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Books are shipped to the company on consignment and charged to their account at company rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every member of the company engaging in the service an average of 3 hours per week, and so reporting to the local service director, shall be entitled to receive books at the prices at which the Society bills to the company, to wit, the company rates shown on the price list. Any margin between the prices above mentioned and the established retail rates belong to tho worker, and it will be his privilege to contribute it to whatsoever fund in the company<sup>7</sup> he may desire or otherwise dispose of It as he may see fit. If the workers themselves enter into an agreement among themselves that they will set aside and contribute to the service fund so many cents from each placement, that will be their privilege, but it should be done by consent and not by compulsion. All who are not workers within the meaning of the above statement should be required to give the full retail price to the company, and the company<sup>7</sup> may do with the fund what it wants to and as it pleases. In determining who shall receive the reduced rate, the matter shall be left between the worker and the Lord. If the worker comes to the service department and requests books at the reduced rate it is to be accepted that that one is putting in the 3 hours a week necessary to obtain books at that rate. If anyone misrepresents the facts for the purpose of getting the books at company rates without complying with the time requirements, he is answerable to the Lord, and not to anyone else.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It has been found, in calling upon the rulcrs, that a great many of them cannot be reached in one, two, or three calls. Thereby considerable time is spent in calling upon them without getting any results. Therefore, in the future one call should be made on each ruler. If he is found at home, of course, the booklet is to be presented to him as outlined in the September </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin. </span><span class="font4">If he is not at home, and his wife or some other member of the family is there, the booklet may be left with that one for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A good plan to adopt in leaving the booklet when the ruler is out is to have a few large envelopes with booklets in them already sealed, aud Instead of leaving the open booklet, to be looked through and handled by the one with whom you leave It, write the name of the ruler on the envelope containing the booklet, mark it “Personal&quot;, and leave It with Instructions that it Is to be delivered to him as soon as he returns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If after one or two calls you are unable to get iu tonch with either the ruler or some member of his family or his secretary, then arrange to mail a copy of the booklet to him, provided the address you have Is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The practice of mailing booklets to the rnlers is to be undertaken only when at least one call has been made In an effort to present the booklet to him personally and the address has been verified.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Enclosed in this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> we are sending to the companies a revised price list, giving their rate and also the retail rate of all publications. The books listed in this price list are in stock, and may be ordered now at the rates listed. The only correction in this price list is on the &lt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet. The retail rate on i the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet will remain ■5e until November 15, and thereafter it will be placed with the public at the rate of 10c, and in combination with oilier booklets at four for a quarter. The company rate will remain 4c during the month of October, and November 1 it will change to 5c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the colporteurs and auxiliary colporteurs we are enclosing with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> a special price list. You will notice that in this price list all the rates on the foreign editions of the books written by Brother Rutherford have been reduced. We feel sure that during the coming year a greater witness will be given among the foreign-speaking people than heretofore. With the English books at four for a dollar, and tiie foreign clothbound books at three for a dollar, there should be a remarkable increase in the distribution of elothbound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW REPORT CARDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REQUIRE LESS INFORMATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah's witnesses will notice that a new report card has been prepared for the fiscal year 1932, which began October 1. This card is practically the same as heretofore, with the exception of a column having been added for Tin-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">dieation</span><span class="font4"> and some of the columns for reporting persons obtaining combinations having been eliminated. Tn other words, it will be necessary to report, only the number of persons obtaining 4-book and 10-hook combinations. Those who take combinations of 2,3,5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 books need not be given, since a record of these two special combinations only is to be kept during this year. All books placed will be reported the same ns usual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who have a supply of the old report cards can continue to use them until their stock has been depleted, since this change can </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">noted on them. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> can be reported either at the bottom of the card or, on the Colporteur Report Cards, under the heading “WT GA Subs”, provided the heading Is crossed out and “V-l” is inserted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Fill Out Report Card Carefully</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is noted in a number of report cards sent in since the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font4">booklet campaign commenced that these booklets are shown on different places in tbe report card. These should he reported under “Miscellaneous Booklets”, no distinction being made between them and the other booklets placed.

This in itself is shown by the fact that during Witness Week there were practically 1,500 more that participated in the work than during any other service week. With I a zeal peculiar to the Lord's house a band of 13,1513 responded to the call, “Remnant to the front,” and moved into action, putting in 188,140 hours In the field. There never was a happier throng than this one, for the time spent in this work brought them a joyful realization i that they were obeying the com-</span></p>

It would seem as If they were giving more consideration to their own selves than to the interests of the Lord’s work. No one who really loves the Lord should want to take undue advantage of this confidential position for his own personal gain. These slips were not sent to Jehovah’s witnesses for them to get hooks at this special rate. They were, sent to them to insert in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklets so that they might have a part in carrying the warning to the rulers in Satan’s organization, that the rulers might be warned concerning Jehovah’s I in eposes.</span></p>

The witness left with the people in a more complete form numbered 29,882 cloth books and 702.970 booklets, making a total of 732,852 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From every standpoint this was the greatest week on record. Some were handicapped in doing the work with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet because of not having a sufficient supply to last them through the week. Many wrote us that their supply had gone much faster than they had ever dreamed it was possible. Those on the Pacific coast were curtailed because of the sinking of the boat which carried Oakland depot's stock. But in spite of all this, no other week can compare with it. We rejoice to make known these glorious results to you that you too might praise the Lord that the time has come for it to lie made known that he is God and that he has permitted you to have a part in this work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Now Is the Time to Place Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Poor Need the Message</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The evidences on every hand indicate that 1931 is going to exceed anything we have had up to the present time for the Kingdom witness. The announcement that during the “Watchtower Week&quot; we shall be able to offer the people four bound books for one dollar must thrill tlie hearts of all of the Lord’s anoluted. It is just like the Lord, when conditions get bad and the people’s need for the Kingdom becomes more intense, to supply the Kingdom food in greater abundance. About two thousand years ago Jesus had his mouthpiece, John, write of the time in which we are now living in these words: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because lie knoweth that he hath but a short time.&quot; Satan’s great wrath Is directed against God and his organization. He therefore oppresses the people in diverse and numerous ways and causes great sorrow and trouble to befall them. He then induces his hypocritical clergy to charge all these sorrows, woes and calamities to Jehovah God, His object is to turn the people away from God before Armageddon is fought. This brings out the great issue of our day and puts it squarely up to tlie anointed. What are you going to do about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The opening of the book of Revelation has increased the anger of Satan and his agents against the anointed. “The man of sin” is more determined than ever to resist the onward march of the truth. The delusion of that class will cause them, to become even more vituperative and reckless. On the other side, the opening of Revelation fires with greater zeal those who love God. More determined than ever are they to give the testimony as he commands. Amidst tlie storm of Slander and persecution, and against the increased opposition from the enemy, the remnant march on. Some are timid and apprehensive, hut all are singing the praises of Jehovah with an increased inward joy. They love) God and are marching to Armageddon, and they know that victory Is sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ever since 1918, in European countries conditions have been going from bad to worse. As far back as 1923 Germany had over eight million on her dqle list; and 1930 was the worst year for unemployment Great Britain ever witnessed. Yet, despite this condition, in Germany the Kingdom witness in placing books increased 150 percent over the preceding year. The brethren in Europe are fighting in a manner that we have not commenced to experience yet. The United States has not reached anywhere near the intensity of suffering that European countries have. Consequently, viewing it from the standpoint of the ability of the people to obtain the literature, the conditions are much more favorable in this country than in auy other, and even though unemployment is great, a big majority of the people can obtain the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many of the friends seem to feel that because of this unemployment they should drop down to combinations of booklets rather than present the bound books. This is an illogical conclusion when viewed from the standpoint of the Lord’s kingdom, for the worse the conditions are, the more need there is for the knowledge of tlie Lord and of his purposes, the more fertile the field is; and the Lord is always willing to supply the needs of the people. Therefore the workers, having faith in the Lord’s ability to provide, should get the wrong idea out of their heads immediately and view this issue from the standpoint of the Lord and his kingdom. Nothing will prepare the minds of tlie Iieople for the truth more than hard times and trouble.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Leaders Available First and Last Parts of Drive</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Family Anticipating Blessed Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have still some more good news for you regarding this drive. In the last </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> we advised that the Bethel family was to start out on the first day of the drive and the service leaders were to serve the different classes requesting their service for the first part of the week. Since then Brother Rutherford has authorized us to send speakers for the last three days of the week also, so that the Bethel family will be able to spend six out of the ten days in the field service during this drive. Tills is a source of great joy to each one of them, as they are confined most of the time to the manufacture and shipping of tlie literature. We are looking forward ro uniting with all of the anointed'</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">Evidently in making this provision to reduce the price of the literature during this “Watchtower Week” the Lord is giving the people a special opportunity to obtain this knowledge of his purposes. The offer of four books for a dollar is to be particularly associated with “Watchtower Week”. It is especial-(Continued on page 2, column 2) throughout the earth In this mighty drive in the vindication of the word and name of Jehovah. This means that we shall be able to serve classes in Michigan, Ohio, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and northeastern North Carolina, as w<sup>r</sup>ell as in the New England States, and New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Send in your request for service leader early, and specify whether you want the appointment made for the first part of the drive or the last part. As far as possible we will try to arrange these appointments in accordance with your request. However, it may be necessary in some cases to send brethren out at the opposite end of the week to that requested, due to the fact that we may get more requests for one end of the week than for the other. In that event you will be notified well in advance, if you get your request in here early enough.!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Week Announcing Your Arrival</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The greatest radio campaign in the entire world will have been carried on during the five months preceding “Watchtower Week”, informing the people that someone will call upon them with Judge Rutherford’s books. Starting with 150 stations on December 8, the number to broadcast Brother Rutherford’s weekly lectures has increased by leaps and bounds until now there are 215. There is scarcely a place in the United States and Canada where the message cannot be heard by those who have a radio set. Millions of radio slips announcing these programs have been handed to the people personally, and millions of other personal invitations have been given to listen in. There Is amongst men no other organization that can cope with the Lord’s; for this is the Lord's work, his organization, and to him belongs all the honor and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not only by the radio have the people been prepared to receive the Lord’s witnesses, but also by the most severe financial depression this country has ever known. None of Satan’s agents, financial, political or religious, have been able to give the people one word of cheer or comfort. Thousands of them who by a life of ease and comfort have heretofore been blinded to the evils of his organization are getting their eyes open and are looking for some relief. Where in times past many would slam the door in your face, today they will stand and drink in eagerly the message you have to give to them. Not all, of course, are in this attitude of mind, but the number is increasing.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Adjustment of Rates to Be Made from Report Cards</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Many of you have looked forward to a time when a 'Special offer would be made during some special service week on a combination of Brother Rutherford’s books. That time has come, and we are overjoyed to announce that Brother Rutherford has just instructed us to tell you that for “Watchtower Week” only, a special offer is-to be made on all English clothbound books written by him, of any one for 30c, or any four of them for $1,00. Remember, this offer is to be for the ten days only, May 8 to 17. Until the 8th, and immediately after the 17th, the regular rates will be effective. If during the 10 days any orders are taken for delivery after the 17th, the regular rates are to apply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is convinced of the importance of doing speedily the work which the Lord has commanded his people to do. Revelation 16: 21 shows that ‘a great plague of hail shall fall upon men following the pouring out of the seventh vial’, and commenting thereon </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> Book 2 says, “There must be a widespread witness to the truth amongst the nations to make known God’s purposes, particularly with reference to the prophecies which smite Satan’s organization.” To aid each worker in enjoying a greater part, this special offer is to be made for “Watchtower Week” and the Society is offering to bear the burden of the reduction in retail rate by granting to each class, sharpshooter, auxiliary and pioneer colporteur a certain amount of credit on each bound book written- by Brother Rutherford which is placed by them during “Watchtower Week”. The arrangement will be tills: Upon receipt of the report card for “W’atch-tower Week” from the class, sharpshooters, and auxiliary and pioneer colporteurs, the respective accounts will be given a certain amount of credit for every one of Brother Rutherford’s clothbound books in English placed during these 10 days. Tbe classes will be allowed a credit of 5c on each of the first seven, 10c on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> 1 and 10c on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> 2. So be sure your reports are sent in promptly, contain the activities for the entire period of ten days, and show all books placed. Also remember to report tbe number of persons who take the literature </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">because of the radio</span><span class="font3"> besides those who do but who have not heard the programs. A credit memo will not be sent, but the amount of credit allowed will be shown on yonr statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Four hooks for only $1.00!</span><span class="font3"> It is a rate so low that some people will scarcely believe you when you make the offer to them at that price. To make the matter doubly impressive, a special wrapper is being prepared with this attractive offer printed on it, calling attention to the fact also that the offer is to be for “Watchtower Week” only. A quantity of these wrappers will be sent to each class, sharpshooter and colporteur for “Watchtower Week”, as soon as they are ready. Pioneers are asked to be sure to keep their addresses up to date, so that these will not be misdirected. These will be sent to</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The latter part of the text above quoted is to the effect that Satan is carrying on his campaign vigorously because he knows he has but a short time. With the unfolding of the book of Revelation the Lord has revealed to his people things that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">must he done speedily.</span><span class="font3"> In this the Lord indicates that he Is going to make every provision for the needs of the people through the activity of his servant.

<p><span class="font3">As this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> is being prepared to go to press the following press dispatch has come to our attention :</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>“‘SICK WORLD,’ TOPIC</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">“Business Men at Two Meets</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To Consider Remedies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Washington,—What big business proposes to do about the ‘ailing world’ will be discussed at two forthcoming conventions to be held at Atlantic City and here. One is the annual meeting of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States at Atlantic City in April, the other the first meeting on American soil of the International Chamber of Commerce, to be held here May 4 to 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The latter meeting is attracting widespread interest, not only because business men of 46 countries will attend, but because the worldwide depression will be, for the first time, attacked by business men as a world problem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is remarkable that the Devil’s representatives should choose, the time immediately preceding the “Watchtower Week&quot; for their conference ; and not surprising, either,</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">600,000 Testimonies in 10 Days</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>A Wonderful Witness to God’s Name and Word</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">We have arranged for a quota for this drive of 600,000 testimonies. We are looking to the 8,000 or more class workers to make 340,000 testimonies, the 1,200 pioneers to make 185,000, and the anxiliaries, 75,000. This can be done if each one settles down and does his particular part. It averages only about four testimonies an hour for each worker. During this drive each class worker should put in at least ten hours, or an average of one hour a day. We feel confident that the majority of them will put in much more than this. Each pioneer should average forty hours for the week. This is an average of only four hours a day for the entire drive. The auxiliaries should average twenty hours, which would be only two hours a day. If when we think of the desperate efforts that Satan through his organization is making to maintain his dominion and control over the people of the earth. Unquestionably the decision rendered by this assembly will be for Satan and against Jehovah’s kingdom, implying that Jehovah is responsible for the present distress upon the earth and that they, as the people’s deliverers, are coming to the rescue. This will be a part of their scheme to perpetuate the present selfish and oppressive systems of the adversary. This evidence of the activity on the part of Satan’s organization should be a stimulus to every one of the Lord’s anointed to take advantage of the provision the Lord has made for us during this special week to bring a real message of bope and life to the people and in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Four of these beautifully bound books for a dollar is the most attractive combination of books in the world at that price. The message of the Kingdom contained in them cannot be measured in dollars and cents. If the Lord is so everruling and directing that this message should be vigorously carried to the people, it behooves each one of his anointed to put forth u corresponding effort to carry out his part of the covenant. The prophet shows that the people of earth are starving: famishing not for bread or water, although it is evident on every hand that they are in great need of this; their need for the hearing of tbe word of the Lord is much greater. These are not man’s words, but the Lord's. Tlie question therefore is, Are we' going to be like one of the hundred and one organizations that simply supply the people with that food that perisheth, or are we going to be distinctly the Lord’s witnesses and offer them the Lord's message in its most nourishing form, in the BOOKS?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The big thing to be offered to the people during this week is the bound books. There isn't any combination of booklets we would have to offer the people that would be as attractive as the four bound books for one dollar. Therefore let each one take tills mutter to the Lord iu prayer and ask for his guidance and direction in the organization of this drive and then put forth his best endeavors to carry the message to i the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">each one will carry out the above quota for himself Individually we shall more than surpass the “600,000 testimonies” mark. Do not forget that this is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Week. </span><span class="font3">Every call you make ascertain whether the people are listening to the Watchtower radio programs, and mark clearly liow many of them take the books because of the message they hear over the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Continued from page 1, column 4) scriptions, these have also had a stimulating effect upon the desire of the people for the bound books. Many who have received tlie catalogue have intended sending in their orders and will be glad to see you. And now the Lord has permitted special arrangements to be made to snpply these people with the opportunity to get the books at a special rate of 4 for $1.00. Are [ you going to do your part in bring-1</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>We Serve Because of the Love of the Truth</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> has been stressing the great importance of the name of Jehovah and the privilege which God has given to the anointed of having a little part in the vindication of his name by maintaining their integrity. The clearness of light on this subject shows conclusively that those who unselfishly go out into the field service do not do so for the purpose of “selling books”, as those who oppose the Lord’s organization charge, but for the purpose of honoring the name of Jehovah. The more deeply this is appre-dated, the purer the motive, and the more one can be used by him in fulfilling this divine commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus distinctly shows that the Lord’s service is not for the purpose of enabling one to make a living, for he says that after such things the Gentiles seek; but he does promise the necessities of life to those who seek first the interests of God’s kingdom. In this connection we have received an Interesting letter from a pioneer who has been in the colporteur work for about twelve years. He says, “I quit trying to sell books years ago. There is nothing in the Bible about ‘selling books’, and pioneers don’t do it. . . . Onr experience proves that God is not poor, nor his blessings limited hy conditions brought about in the field by Satan’s organization. Furthermore, for many years in the work, God’s word has proven true, where it says, ‘Bread shall be given him; his water shall be sure,’ entirely apart from such considerations as good territory or bad territory, financial conditions or any other considerations connected with or dependent upon Satan’s arrangement. We can honestly and earnestly tell the people that it is nothing to us financially, whether they procure the books or not; we are seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, hence w<sup>r</sup>e are guaranteed the necessities of life, irrespective of whether anyone procures books from us or not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Watchtower Week” will give all a real opportunity to prove that they are in the work to honor Jehovah’s name by unselfishly bringing to the people the opportunity of getting God's comforting message. It will cost you your time and strength to bring it to them, and the reward for your unselfishness will be the approval of the Lord as you seek to honor his name, Remember the special offer for this week only, any of Brother Rutherford's elothbound books, In English, for 30c, or any four for $1.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ing this offer to them? Are you going to be among those who show the Lord that they wish to obey his commands and do the work speedily which he has given them to do? “Watchtower Week” will give you another opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Remember the feature of the week besides the 4 books for $1.00 is to keep a record of the number of persons obtaining the literature who liave been listening to the Watch Tower programs. As shown in the hist </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font3"> this is to be reported in tbe column headed “Total Persons Obtaining Literature”, and to be followed by an R. Immediately below is to be drawn a line, and below tlie line the number of persons obtaining literature who have not listened to the programs is to be reported.

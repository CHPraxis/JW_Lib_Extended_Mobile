<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Encourage Field Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Io this column, each mouth, will be found a thought which should be carefully considered by the anointed of the Lord. This time our subject is “WORKERS&quot;. Maybe the nest will be “HOURS”, “TESTIMONIES&quot; or “PRESENTATION”, but each will be about some means whereby the interests of the Kingdom may be increased, in your territory. We hope the thoughts will be helpful. Those who know Jehovah and have the 'white stone’, or in other words, have his vote of approval, will be in the vineyard. During the past year there were, on an average, 4,733 company workers in the field each week, 1,137 pioneers, anil 694 auxiliaries, or a total of 6,564 workers weekly. It is encouraging to note that this is an increase for 1931 of 438 weekly workers, as during the previous year there were only 6,126 weekly workers. However, during Witness Week there was a grand total of 13,613 workers engaging in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now we are wondering what happens each week to the other 7,049. There is a large field in the United States. The workers arc few, and in order to reach the people so that the marking may be done it will take all the workers who are in line for the Kingdom. Wiiat can be done? How can we get more workers in the field regularly? What can we do to help others sec their privileges? One thing, we believe, is essential, and that is to encourage the brethren iu the companies not only to read </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and the recent publications of the Society, but to study them. We feel sure that if those in line for the Kingdom are going to make their calling and election sure their privilege will be brought so clearly to their attention through </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> that they will become regular weekly workers. The Kingdom work in which we are engaged is the most important work of all time, and we should help one anot her to see clearly what </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> has to say regarding our responsibilities and privileges. 'The company workers, we hope, will reach an average weekly quota of 4,950 for the entire year 1932, When we speak of the company workers we also include the sharpshooters. For the pioneers we are anticipating .1,300 regular workers and 750 auxiliaries. This makes a total of 7,000 weekly workers in the field, out of a possible 14,000. The pioneers ought to be able to keep their 1,300 in the field easily, because in September there were 1,655 enrolled in this branch of the service.

<p><span class="font2">Good morning. The people need a righteous government. Centuries ago Jehovah promised that he would provide the people on I earth with a righteous government in his due time. That due time has now come, and as one of Jehovah’s witnesses I am here to give you the information. These books cover the entire matter, proving beyond any doubt that the government Jehovah has provided will bring to the peoples of earth, lasting peace, prosperity, health, happiness and everlasting life. These books are really a gold mine of information. Other books of this size cost not less than fifteen dollars. We arc, preaching the gospel or good news of the kingdom by putting these books in the hands of the people, and money is contributed by those who love the Lord to enable the people to have them so cheaply. If you contribute a dollar for any four, or $2.60 for the entire ten, I shall be pleased to leave these with you and take that amount. I am sure you will be greatly blessed by reading them and by helping some one else to learn about the blessings that are coming.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Once more comes the call to action, “Remnant to the front!&quot; The Lord has permitted his people to make arrangements for another great campaign, and to the call the remnant joyfully responds, “Lord, here am I; send me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Testimony Week begins November 7 and lasts until November 15. Its purpose is to testify to the honor of Jehovah’s name by offering the new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> for the first time to the people. With it Is to be offered a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> booklet, and the amount to be taken for the combination is to be 40c. What a combination that will make! Anyone who reads it will certainly have no reason for unknowingly supporting Satan’s organization any longer. It should thrill all those who love the Lord with joy to think of the privilege that Jehovah lias given them to sound the alarm which these hooks contain and to boldly go forth as his witnesses that he is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord’s time has come for this warning to be given to Christendom, as is clearly evidenced by the way in which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> booklets have been going out. II is almost unbelievable, but it is the i.ruth nevertheless, that the factory here in Brooklyn is now working on its fifth million since the convention and these are being shipped out so fast that it Is necessary to run a day and a night shift to keep them in stock. In Germany they are working on their fifth million also. The message contained in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> is equally important in order that those who desire to seek meekness and righteousness may clearly discern the Devil’s organization and may know what is the Lord’s side, on which to take their stand. The time has now come to offer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> booklet, for only 40c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Actuated by the Lord’s spirit, (he remnant are sure to respond to this another special week of testifying to the rulers and the people concerning Jehovah’s purposes. Here we quote again the special testimony which Brother Rutherford has prepared to be used during this week in presenting </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> to the people,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Good morning, Mr, Jones. I have come to give you a testimony concerning Jehovah’s purposes. I am one of his witnesses and I am thus preaching the gospel. Within a short time from now Christendom will be completely destroyed by the army of the Lord. Jehovah has made it clear by his Word that the people must be notified of that approaching destruction and shown the reason why it will be done. These hooks explain all about It and show you that God’s kingdom is the only hope for the people.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall They Sing</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorize the Testimony; Give It Word for Word</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Never has there been a time when the message of the Lord should be spoken with such unity in its presentation as now. The greatest results as (o the spreading of the literature were accomplished during the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> booklet campaign. Why? Because Jehovah wanted this particular message given. The Lord's people heartily engaged in this work, and they used the short witness or testimony which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> presented to them a few months ago. The words were put in our mouths, what to say and how to say it. We speak not our words, but the words which Jehovah through his organization gives us l o speak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">God is dealing with his organization on earth, and no one who has the love of the truth can deny this fact. Did not the Lord reveal to his people just recently how he has been directing the affairs of the faithful? Did not the Lord reveal that his people would put on sackcloth from 1914 to 1918 and that they would be dead in the street for ‘three days and a hair ; that they would be resuscitated and then taken into the wilderness and that while there he would feed them with food convenient? Then he brought them out of l.lie wilderness and Ids people were assembled, in 1922, at Cedar Point, and on “The Day” 1hey received specific instructions as to the advertising of the Kipg and the Kingdom. Not only did the anointed of the Lord carry out every detail as to the fulfilment of Revelation in the pouring out ol: this vial, but thereafter, in the Lord's due time, all the vials were poured out as instructed in the Lord’s Word, although at the time the Lord’s people did not know that they were doing this particular work in the earth. Recognizing these facts and knowing that the Lord is using his organization, and knowing, too, Uni t tie has been providing them with informntion regarding his Word that astounds his people, we can be very sure that he will continue to use this organization to the glory of his name. We know for a fact that the work accomplished in the past years was richly blessed by the Lord, and we c:i n fee! certain that that which we have lo do now will be to the Lord’s glory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Due to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Booklet This Convention Surprise Was Delayed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the thrills of the Columbus eonveniion was the announcement that, commencing October 1 this year, the bound books by Brother Rutherford would be 4 for $1.00 to the public, wilh (tie exception of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have been nimble to take advantage of this arrangement, due to the fact that two very important campaigns had to precede it: that of the distribution of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font1">booklet, with its warning to l.lie rulers and the people, and the Findkxi-twi campaign during Testimony Week. Now the time lias come to take advantage of this wonderful provision which the Lord has made to place the Kingdom message with the people in its most permanent form, the bound books. 4 for $1.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">'Many of the friends are inclined to attribute the increase in the booklets and the decrease in the bound books to the depression that exists in tiie land. A careful study of last year’s activities, however, demonstrates that this is not the case. The South and Southwest, which embraces Ilie states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Oklahoma and Texas, where the greatest depression existed during last winter, and practically all of Iasi, year, for that matter, hud the highest percen I age of bound books of any section of this country, ’this proves that the needs of the people, the enthusiasm of Jehovah's witnesses, and the Lord’s gracious provisions to supply their needs are the big factors in placing lhe bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Commencing November Id, all of the anointed throughout the earth will immediately concentrate on the distribution of the bound hooks. Any of I.he books written by BniiIler Rutherford may be used in the d-book combination, with the exception of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font1"> which is Io be placed at 35c. Tiie entire combination of 10 books will be placed for $2.60. The latter part of November and al! of December slmuld be devoted to stressing these combinations. The 4 for $1.00 should be emphasized. The preseul.nl.ion should be us outlined in the testimony appearing In another part of Illis </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">UuLtelin</span><span class="font1"> ami prepared by Brother Rutherford. This testimony should he followed completely and explicitly. If it is done, much more territory can be covered in an effective manner than heretofore. The time has come when the Lord’s people should raise the voice and with the voice together sing the praises of Jehovah from door to door. By all using the one testimony the horn of the Lord and of Gideon will not give an uncertain sound, hut one uniform sound, proclaiming the kingdom of our God and his Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The campaign after Testimony W»ek should be concentrated on the rural territory and small towns, cleaning them up if possible before the severe winter weather commences. This is the time of year that the people in these sections have some money and lots of time on their hands and the big question in their minds is, “What is the</span></p>

The first number will contain the article “The Kingdom, the Hope of the World”, and the Resolution, with oilier interesting matter for the Spanish people, and is to take the place of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> booklet in Spanish in the United States anti Lal in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is hoped that, companies with territories where Spanish-speaking people are found will arrange for this feature, and that pioneers and auxiliaries give a reasonable attention to this work. One need not have to speak Spanish to engage in this work, as there will be a printed notice on the first page of the magazine that will tell the story. Simply Lake 5c or leave the magazine for a few days, and when coming back got the subscription price, or the price of the copy, or the copy Itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The subscription price is 75c a year; pioneers and auxiliaries are granted a special rate. Company rate will be 4e a copy on this first issue, which is offered to the people at 5c. Subscription blanks will be sent to you when filling your order.</span></p>

The pioneers have been convinced that full time in the service is required of them and they have been encouraged to carry on because of the blessings the Lord has given them. They encourage one another to become more active when they meet in the field in Isolated places and at conventions. Most of the auxiliaries are with the company workers.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Directors and Sharpshooters, Please Take</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Notice!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It has been decided to discontinue the practice of calling for a yearly territory report from the companies and sharpshooters. Henceforth, as soon as the 1931 fiscal yearly territory report' has been submitted as already requested, it. will no longer be necessary for service directors and sharpshooters to keep a territory report for the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the place of a yearly territory report to the Society, it. is now requested that service directors notify the Service Department in those cases where the companies are not thoroughly covering the territory assigned to them, in order that cither an appropriate adjustment of territory may be made or that provisions may be made to send in pioneers, to sec that a thorough witness is given each year. Sharpshooters, however, will not need to notify the Society in cases where their territory is not being thoroughly covered, for the Society makes it a point to send in pioneers to assist the sharpshooters whenever this Is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since the Society no longer requires a yearly territory report, we suggest that the service directors dispense with keeping such detail records for their local use. We recommend the following of the Zoning System as far as keeping a record of what territory is assigned, when last worked, the number of times worked during the current year ; in fact, everything except, keeping a record of what literal tire was placed Ui the territory., Service directors should eliminate keeping any data not required by the Society or being used by the company, so as to permit the giving of more time and energy to the great work of witnessing from door to door to the honor and praise of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This rule does not apply to pioneers, as they are to continue to submit to the Society the territory reports requested of ihem, the same as ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(Continued from page 1, column 3) forty cents for them, and I am sure you will receive a great blessing by learning I heir contents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Memorize It so that you can deliver It smoothly and so that the people can understand you. This is to be Testimony Week, and that which you say to the people is to be considered as the testimony which is to be given. More time in the field will mean more testimonies delivered and more people given the opportunity of receiving the message in book form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your report for the week should be sent to this office promptly. Remember, as heretofore, the report is .to be for the entire period beginning November 7 and including Sunday November 15. This will mean that your previous week’s report will close with Friday, November G. In making this week’s report, use one of the regular weekly report cards, as special ones are not being sent. This applies to companies, pioneers and auxiliaries. To the sharpshooters only will a special card be sent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">office that there are many company , directors who do not pay sufficient i attention to their territory bound-<sup>: </sup>aries and that a number of friends in the different companies do not. work the territory assigned to them. As a result, considerable confusion is caused and energy wasted. Each company director and sharpshooter should see that he knows his territory boundary and should instruct the workers not to go beyond those boundaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(Continued from page 1, column 4) this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bulletin</span><span class="font1"> should be used word for word by all of the Lord’s anointed. The Lord has said that his witnesses will raise the voice and that with the voice together shall they sing, and that will be literally true in this testimony. Every one of the Lord's anointed should earnestly study and memorize this, and should understand why they say the things they do say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Just stop for a moment and analyze the testimony. The very first statement, “The people need a righteous government,” is a fact and an approach in which everyone will agree. Then you tell them that Jehovah will establish a righteous government. Also you introduce yourself as one of Jehovah’s witnesses who brings to them this information. You reveal to them what Jehovah’s government, will bring to ihe people, 'Tasting peace, prosperity, health, happiness and everlasting life.” Then you state what a set of books like this would ordinarily cost, arousing their curiosity. You give them your reason for presenting the books, “It is our method of preaching the gospel,” or the good news. You show them that the work is carried on by contributions and that this is why we can offer the books at such a low figure. IVc arc not selling these books to the people. We merely ask them to contribute a dollar for four of the clol.bboimd books, or $2.60 for the entire set of ten. You close with a few Thirds assuring them of the Lord’s blessing in their reading of these books. This testimony covers every point Scripturally, logically and legally. If every one of the Lord’s people uses this testimony, we feel sure that a greater witness will be given to the glory and honor of Jehovah in our part of the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We feel certain that the testimony that was mailed to the brethren by Brother Rutherford on October 16 will also be a. great aid to them during the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> campaign Novenilier 7 to 15. The testimony should be memorized and used, and we know that more people will be reached and have an opportunity to hear the message. As Ezekiel stated in his prophecy, we are to mark Ihem in their foreheads; and if anyone does not want to be marked tiiere, then leave him and go to the next door. Perhaps the next time you call, In six months or so, another member of the family, or the same person, will be in a different heart condition and will want to be marked as being on the Lord’s side. At least, we will give them more than one opportunity to obtain the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let us all remember now that obedience to the Lord’s commands is really essential. The Lord has given us these words- to speak. Let us study them, let us make them our own, and then use them in our witnessing work. We are now engaged in ii work that must be done immediately and with effect, We should not engage in arguments or controversial speech. Our purpose is to give the testimony, and then pass on quickly to tiie next one. If the books are taken we accept the contribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If we are refused there</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">is no reason for us to lose our proper poise. We simply withdraw genteelly. The Lord is with his organization. lie is blessing his people. They are his witnesses in the earth.</span></p>

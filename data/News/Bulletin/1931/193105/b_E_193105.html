<p><span class="font3">Walclitower Week is here at last! You have prayed for Hie Lord's blessing' upon it; you have anticipated going out: with the four books for $1.00; you have prepared for action by wrapping them in lite, attractive wrappers; and finally the time to launch the attack has arrived. &quot;Cry out and shout, Q daughter of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Ismet in the midst of thee.” Yes, the first big day is Friday, Slay 8, followed by nine more which are going to he just as big. You, together with the rest of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lord's faithful ones, small in number, though mighty in the spirit of the Lord, will fie putting forth a special effort to show forth his praises solely because you love him supremely and delight to obey ids commandments. Through storm and si rife, persecution and all the trouble which Satan may bring Io Itenr against them, those of the ‘elect servant<sup>1</sup> of the Lord will not he turned aside from keeping their covenant with the Lord. Is it any wonder, then, that the Lord loves his ‘elect servant’ so dearly, and makes so many wonderful promises concerning him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zeriibbabel clearly foreshadows this ‘elect servant of Jehovah, in whom he delights’, and the faithful remnant at the very close of the witness work who remain faithful and true to the end are idealilled as a part of the ‘elect servant’. Concerning this servant llaggaf prophesied, &quot;In tlial day, sailli the I Lord of hosts, will I lake thee, O Zerubbiiliel my servanl, the son of Sliouliiel. saith the Lord, and will ’ make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord of hosts.” (Hag. 2:23) One translation renders it, “I will set thee as a signet ring on the finger.” Since a signet ring is a mark of identification and symbolizes a pledge of fidelity, it. shows that Zcruhbabel would be marked as identified with Jehovah’s organization and as having received the pledge of fidelity from the Most High as the representative of his organization. If would mean also that Jehovah has given his pledge to forever use the ‘elect servant’ to carry nut his purposes. The ‘faithful servant' class is sealed with the seal of Ihe living God. Tlie seal bears the name of rhe Father and his city, at a prominent place upon the sealed ones, that it may be seen. The Scriptures seem fully to support the conclusion that God in bis own good way and manner will reveal and specially show his love to his faithful ones</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Watchtower Week provides another great opportunity for one to identify himself as being on the Lord’s side and against Satan and ins organization. It will be joyfully '■ seized by all those who love God and who desire to be of the ‘elect servant’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this land and abroad, in class territory and in remote pioneer see-lions. those who love the Lord supremely will lie putting forth every possible effort to fulfill their divine conmi ission.

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>An Excellent Report for 6 Months</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Centuries ago the Lord had written: “The Lord gave the word: great was the army of those that i published it.”-—Ps. 68: IL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">TllC.se are not great in human at-Itiin menIs, but they are strong in the Ijord and the power of his might. They know that the Lord gave the word. As port of Jehovah’s servant I hey are blind to everything else. They know that the God of al! Ihe earlli shall do right, and any smoke screen that Satan may erect to becloud this fact is to them only an added incentive to vindicate the imme and word of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because this conviction is dominating the remnant as God’s witnesses they are invincible. The following summary of the past six months’ nclivilies of (lie classes, sharpshooters and colporteurs compared with the same period last year is proof of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A brief analysis of this summary is here submitted for the encouragement and help of the Lord's anointed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Spring, with its sunny days, its flowers, its green trees, with life coming forth from all parts of God’s great creation, fills us with new vigor and zeal to press on in the most wonderful campaign waged against the Det'll and his cohorts. The rommori people at this time are by no means prosperous. Hard limes are still with us, and there is continual shaking of the nations, unrest and agllnlion in evidence. These things have sobered the minds of the people, and many are seeking after truth and righteousness. The remnant are ihe only ones (Conliinied on page 2, column 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers and Auxiliaries Leave Splendid Witness</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1,057 Pioneers, 692 Auxiliary Colporteurs, Reporting Weekly</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Six mouths of the fiscal year of 1931 have sped around anil the time is here to let you know just how the witness work has been progressing. The above table is truly wonderfully encouraging when it is seen how the Lord’s consecrated people have entered into the colporteur work in spite of everything that Satan is doing to discourage and hinder the proclamation of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You will notice that there has been an average of 1,057 pioneers and 692 auxiliary colporteurs reporting weekly, as compared with the 851 pioneers and 431 auxiliaries reporting weekly during the same period last year. Does not this in itself manifest the real spirit of the remnant? This represents an increase of over 24 percent in number of active pioneers and a 60-percent increase in that of active auxiliary colporteurs. These colporteurs have shown an improvement in the number of hours they have put in weekly. The pioneers Increased their weekly average from 21.45 to 22.24, and the auxiliaries increased their weekly average from 9.38 to 10.31, almost an hour in each instance. That’s good, colporteurs ; keep up the good work. The result is that the total number of hours has taken a big jump, so that the total for this year for both branches of the colporteur work Is 795,707 hours. Consequently many, many testimonies have been given. We have no basis for comparison here, however, ns a record was not kept last year; but this year’s figures show that the pioneers have given 2,160,038 testimonies, and the auxiliaries 708,335, or a total of 2,874,373. We notice that there are still some colporteurs who forget to report their testimonies. This means that they arc holding back the total, and If the 10,000,000 quota for the year is not attained it will be partly due to their not having done their part. So bear in mind, colporteurs, REPORT TESTIMONIES EVERY<sup>7</sup> WEEK.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In spite of hard times, the literature is still going out, and in total pieces placed there is a hig increase over last year's 6 months’ report. This year 1,295,067 pieces have been reported liy the pioneers, as compared with 1,010,791, of last year. The auxiliaries increased their total from 179,335 pieces of literature to 327,175. The pioneers’ Increase was made entirely in booklets, as their number of bound books decreased from 567,551 to 487,891, or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">14</span><span class="font3"> percent. The increase in booklets amounted to over 82 percent. The auxiliaries showed an increase in both bound books and booklets, their increase in books placed amounting to 9 percent, and in their booklets to almost 155 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Surely tliis is au encouraging report, but this work has been done only because of the enthusiastic zeal of the Lord’s faithful witnesses who have pressed on in the work with joy and determination to exalt Jehovah’s name even in the face of the greatest of obstacles. The only feature of the report to be regretted is tbe decrease In the placement of hound hooks, and it is hoped that with the coming of summer, with the special Watchtower Week with the 4-for-$I.OO combinations of bound books, the colporteurs will get back into their old swing of talking books and laying more stress upon the importance of taking the bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL NOTICE I About Report Cards</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As advised in the special April 9 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font3"> each class, sharpshooter, and colporteur will receive a certain amount of credit for every one of Brother Rutherford's clothbound books in ENGLISH placed during the Watchtower Week. This credit will be given from the report card submitted for this week,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many classes, sharpshooters, and colporteurs place Brother Rutherford’s clothbound books in the foreign languages ns well as in the English language. Therefore, in order to differentiate the bound books in English placed from those in any of the foreign languages that are placed, we ask all who so place literature during this week to divide their bound books section of the report card into two parts. This is to be done by drawing a horizontal line in the middle of the space reserved for reporting ihe number placed, beginning from the “Hari)” and including the “Light Book 2’’ space. The upper part is to show the clothbound books in ENGLISH that were placed, and the lower part the books in the foreign languages placed. It will appear like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Report here all books</span></p><img src="b_E_193105_files/b_E_193105-2.png" alt="" style="width:136pt;height:38pt;">

<p><span class="font3">Each worker who places both tlie English and the foreign clothbound books by Brother Rutherford during this week will please be sure to so make out his report. If each one cooperates, It will help us to give you the proper credit due with the minimum amount of time and effort.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Now is the time to proclaim the Kingdom far and wide, to the titter-1 most parts of the earth. The Lord’s ! people have, the truth. They have ; printed Hie books. They take the time and they give tbe testimony of the Kingdom to the people. May, June and July are three fine months to canvass the small towns, side roads and byways, and the little lanes, and leave in the homes in these places the three books for a dollar, or the two </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lifiht</span><span class="font3"> books and four booklets for a dollar.

Lord's people from singing. Why not be that way all the time and make the remaining five months of the fiscal year the best yet? It will take hard plugging, but after the Watchtower Week there will be much to do with books and booklets. especially books. We hope that every director, sharpshooter, plo-</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Encouraging Words from the Friends Aid in Securing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Stations</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the last </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> an announcement was made in regard to giving a word of commendation on the Watchtoweb programs sent over the station in your vicinity. This has proved helpful in many cases in securing favorable contracts for the ensuing year. The enemy has been trying hard to keep the truth from going over the air, by seeking to induce some managers or owners of stations to keep our programs off. However, the station can hardly refuse the programs if the people desire them. If from time to time you write in to the station, or phone them, telling them how much you appreciate the lectures given by Judge Rutherford, it will greatly aid in continuing the radio service through the Watchtoweb programs. Also ask those you canvass, who enjoy the programs, to write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The New Catalogs</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is evident from the large orders being received for the new catalogs that the friends misunderstand the purpose in printing these. They are to be sent to radio listeners who write requesting further information concerning the literature or the Society and its work. This is the primary purpose. Its secondary purpose is for the convenience of the workers, in that one of these catalogs may be used as a prospectus. It was not the idea to have them distributed promiscuously to the public, in canvassing or otherwise. In order to conserve our present stock, we are compelled to reduce all orders for catalogs to two (2) copies for each worker. This applies to orders from classes, sharpshooters, and colporteurs,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Workers Should Mention in Each Canvass that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Society Supplies Bibles</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A big majority of homes in this country have Bibles. Our work particularly is to place literature with the people that will enable them to understand the Bible. However, for the convenience of those who have uo Bible, each worker should arrange to have with him a copy of the catalog, showing the different kinds of Bibles which the Society handles, and advise tbe people that he will be glad to take orders for any of such as they may require. In fact, each canvass should Include a reference to the fact that we are very glad to supply Bibles with the literature but that due to the fact that the majority of people have their own Bibles the regular workers do not carry Bibles with them. This not only will be a big help in placing Bibles with people who do not now have thorn, but will also be a great assistance in any I court cases that may arise, by i establishing the fact that our work is purely to help the people understand the Bible and its teachings, proving that we are endeavoring not only<sup>7</sup> to dispose of the literalure produced by the Society but also to place the Bible itself in eases where it is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">neer and auxiliary colporteur will make real preparation for the coming few mouths and give such a witness as has never been given before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Witness Pleasing to Jehovah Was Given</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The comparison of the activities of the classes and sharpshooters for the first six months of the fiscal year 1931 with the similar period for 1030 reveals the following interesting information;</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark10"><span class="font3">Total Hours in service 58% increase Total Workers -...........29%</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark11"><span class="font3">Total Placements ........25%</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark12"><span class="font3">Total Literature ........40%</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark13"><span class="font3">Total Booklets —.......77%</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font3">Total Bound Books .... 13% decrease Total Testimonies No record for 1930</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The hours in the service are, of course, the fundamental point in considering the activity of the Lord’s people; for they indicate the effort put forth by the creature to glorify the Creator. A 58-percent increase for the worst six months of the year is the most thrilling and remarkable record. The Lord alone is able to measure the additional loving zeal and devotion ft represents. Surely as times grow harder, and the opposition of the adversary grows more intense, it must be well pleasing to Jehovah and our Head and Captain to witness such devotion on tbe part of the anointed on earth. This proves that the Lord and the Kingdom service is becoming a more dominant factor in the lives of the remnant. Their every faculty is being more and more subjected to tlie will of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The increase of 29 percent in the number of workers Is also another healthy sign. These arc not new brethren coming into the Truth, but Ilie brethren already<sup>7</sup> in tlie Truth, who are becoming more regular in their field activity, going out once each week or oftener.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tlie increase of 25 percent in placements is the barometer by which we learn how the Kingdom message is received by the people. As a result of the radio and the other agencies the Lord is using now, the field Is more fertile than ever before. The people want the knowledge of the Kingdom, and they are commencing to discern the joyful sound, over tlie air, In your canvass, in the books they read. Blessed indeed is the lot of those whom Jehovah honors with tbe privilege of carrying the Kingdom message to them.</span></p>

The hours per worker tell the same story of additional time and effort on the part of the anointed to magnify the name of Jehovah, each branch substantially increasing over last year’s effort.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">On the whole, the past, six months’ activities cannot be considered other I han marvelous and the Lord’s doings. We at Bethel greatly rejoice in having some little part with you In this blessed service.</span></p>

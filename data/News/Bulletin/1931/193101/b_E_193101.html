<p><span class="font3">It won’t bo long now until January 31, when the big Midwinter IVwk begins. Nine days later, on February 8, it will coino to a close, in what we anticipate will have been the most joyful time ever had in the heart of winter. Get out your heaviest ehilhing, so th:it if the weather is blustering and cold you can bundle up well. Be ready for rainy weather, too; for one can never tell just what kind of weath</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">er </span><span class="font3">well have at that time. Like Israel of old, who partook of rite passover feast with sluff in hand, so now the anointed of the Lord will stand ready for action nt the appointed </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord pictures the activities of his remnant clues upon the earth as 'locusts like unto horses’ (for warfare on the Lord’s side against the enemy), with ‘faces of men’ (reflecting God’s image, benevolent, loving and kind, and with ‘crowns upon their heads' showing that they are clothed with divine authority to do Kingdom work). With ‘teeth as of lions’ (so us to ent the strong meat provided for them by the Lord) and ‘breastplates as of iron<sup>1 </sup>(showing that they are &quot;strong in the Lord and in the power </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">his might” because of their faith and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font3">love), they go into action, making </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">sounding noise like “the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle”, which frightens the enemy. The Lord has revealed these things to his people through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> for their encouragement, that they might better realize the importance of doing that which be lias now given them to do, and the importance of doing it quickly. In the circulation of the various testimonies, without realizing the full import of their siguilieanee, the anointed went forth joyfully doing with their might what their hands found to do. Now the Lord shows us how important the work really was. Not that the importance was in ourselves, but that it was because he showed in his Word that u class devoted to him would be doing these very things. Realizing this, should it. not spur the remnant on to an even more determined activity during 193.1 than ever before? Should we not therefore, confidently expect, that, even though in Ilie heart of winter, tills Midwinter Week will result in a testimony being left in thousands of homes? Tlie locusls are said to have had ‘a king over them. who is the angel of the bottomless pit’. This is none else than Christ Jesus, to whom has been given the key of the bottomless pit. (Bev. 20:1) Under the leadership of such a king victory is assured no matter how powerful the foe might he. “if (tod he for us. who can be against us?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It mny be cold, or there may be rain, snow and mud willi which to contend, or the people mny complain of hard times. Nevertheless the witness must he given; and it will tie given by those who love the Lord with all their heart, mind, soul ami strength. Plan now to keep as wnrin and dry as possible, to avoid sickness, by having Home territory </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">out</span><span class="font3">lined in which to work if the weather is had. Colporteurs, pioneers and auxiliaries, class workers and sharpshooters, are you ready to go out again, like the locusts in Revelation tl, with ihe Kingdom message, which stings as the sting of the scorpion those who oppose God and his kingdom? But, while stinging these, It brings peace and happiness of heart and mind to those who come mid take of the waters of life freely. Midwinter Week approaches. The dates are January 31 to February </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Remember, the big attack is to be with three books for $1,00 or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 </span><span class="font3">and 2) willi four booklets. Presenting the entire set of fl and offering each party his selection will he a real incentive to them Io lake a $1.00 combination and learn of some of the good things which tile Lord has granted. If the $1,00 combination is not desired, then drop to the four bookleis for 25(1. Be sure to keep a record of the number of testimonies given, besides the other regular information called for on the weekly report.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">t'cnninenciiig January 1, the new prices on the books to the public go into effect. Any of the first 7 books may he placed at 3 for $1.00. The tendency on the part of the friends in many sections iy to refrain from offering the bound books to the people because of the hard times. This in Ilie wrong attitude. It indicates that the Impression in the mind of Hie brother or sister who is canvassing is Unit the message of the kingdom of God Is secondary to food, clothing, pleasure and other things for which the people spend their money. The statement of the Lord is Iriio, and applies to every intelligent creature: &quot;Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you.&quot; The few groceries or the siiimi itiaoimt or wearing apparel that people might purchase with the dollar tlmt they could spend for the Kingdom message Is not to be compared witli tiie comfort, hope and peace of mind that they cun obtain from a knowledge of Hie Lord rind his kingdom. Every line of the Lord's anointed who is not so thoroughly convinced of this point, as to go forward and present the issue to the people from that angle alone is living away below his privilege now. Therefore, commencing with January 1, the general offer of 3 books for $1.00 should be stressed by every worker who goes into the field. That does not mean, of course, Unit the 3 books for $2.00 or the 6 for $1.95 are not to be</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Factory and Home Closed February 6, 7 and 8</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">As has been the custom of the Society daring the special drive periods of rim year, the factory ar 117 Adams Street, ami the Bethel home, will be closed so that the entire family may engage in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">field service work during these three days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">•Those classes desiring service leaders for these three days should write the Soeiely, Service Department, and we shall be glad to furnish these within a. radius of five hundred miles of New York city. They will lead the brethren in the service and will be prepared to speak on service during the evenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The director should arrange all canvassing parties and lay out the territories for these three days, as Ilie brethren tlmt serve from Bethel do not do regional service </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">work. </span><span class="font3">offered to the people. These should bo offered in all rural territory and in territory where the people are not hard hit by the present business depression. However, in territory where conditions are not good, where you know the people are hard up, the 3 books for $1.00 should be the general offer, and should be canvassed for enthusiastically. The majority of the people have that amount of money, and there is not a better way under the suu that they could spend it than in obtaining a knowledge of I he Lord, Today, in every large city throughout the country the great department stores are Open and doing it tremendous business in Christmas shopping. Much of the goods that are sold is of un inferior nature and is of very little benefit to the people, but they spend tlieir money lor that sort, of liiing. Tins is proof that the people can and will buy if the matter Is presented to them properly and en-tlmsiastically. If the people had</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Work to Be</span></h2>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Thursday, Saturday and Sunday Excellent Canvassing Days</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The* greatest of sill service Is the Kingdom service; but In order to have this effective il, must be done in a systematic manner. Indiffer-ent ami haphazard methods cannot be pleasing to Ilie Lord; they are not for the best spiritual welfare of the Christian, and are not effective in giving tiie witness. Therefore it becomes a matter of vital importance to every one of Ilie Lord’s anointed to cheek up carefully and ascertain if he is really doing the service lie is doing in a manner that is pleasing to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There can be no doubt in Ilie mind of any of the anointed regarding which is the best day for the witness work. It has been amply demonstrated that Sunday is '1'HE day. But Sunday is not the only day; though some of the friends seem to have that idea. They go out in the service Sunday morning, anti then forget all about service during the remainder of the week. The fact that Sunday is the best day in the week for canvassing should be taken advantage of by all the Lord’s people who can possibly do so. This does not mean, however, that they should become inactive during the remainder of the week. Before Sunday canvassing was generally practiced, most of the work used to be done on Saturday afternoon. Satur</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">day </span><span class="font3">afternoon is still a good canvassing time; the men are at home, as well as the women of the house; therefore the pereenlage of witnessing will possibly be greater on Saturday afternoon than on any other week clay. A great number of the friends are free from secular employment at that time and can easily devote two or three hours to the service and still have sufficient time for such other business as they may find it necessary to do on that day. Therefore, next to Sunday canvassing, we recommend that Saturday afternoon be set aside for the witness work by every one of the Lord’s people who can possibly do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to this, every class should have midweek canvassing parties. The logical time for midweek canvassing parties is Thursday. As a general thing Ilie friends assemble on Wednesday evening; then the director has the opportunity to discuss the service arrangement with them. They can obtain literature and territory at that time and can make appointments to meet one another in groups or hi pairs for the next day’s activities. It is difficult, in many cases, for the friends to plan three or four days in advance, not knowing what is likely to turn up during the intervening period; but when the canvassing party is arranged for the very next day after their meeting, the chances of anything's interfering with the appointment would lie very limited Indeed. Therefore we recommend Thursday as the day for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">midweek canvassing drive. There are many who can participate in these drives who cannot go out on Saturday </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font3">Sunday ; but if one can go out on the three days, so much better the witness to the ntinie of Jehovah and the establishment of his kingdom. Usually on Thursday those of the friends who are employed in domestic </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">service are given</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">ested enough to take the printed message. Even If they don’t take the message today, the Lord's witness will be back in six months or less and give them another chance to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to evidence communicated to this office, the sons of Satan arc being stirred up to attempt to throttle broadcasting of the good news of the kingdom of Jehovah by means of the electrical transcription programs recently inaugurated throughout the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">it is requested that every one concerned in the presentation of this program he advised, in this connection, that full and uninterrupted service, according to contract, is expected of each radio station that has been engaged. Any attempt to interfere with or interrupt the service, maliciously or otherwise, please report promptly to this office, giving all particulars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All letters received by the radio stations in response to the Watchtower program should be turned over by the radio station to the service director taking care of the programs in that city. These letters should be read carefully, and all coming from people residing iu the territory of the class and who cun be reached conveniently by some member of the class, should be answered by a personal call. Responses that come in from people too fur away to call upon, or mall that cannot lie answered by yourself, should be sent to this office immediately, and we will take care of it here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This arrangement will give the friends iu your territory opportunity tv he coworkers in this radio work by giving immediate attention to the response to Brother Rutherford's lectures. We feel sure that the friends will find this a real blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When you mall to us the letters which cannot be answered by personal calls please insert a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">slip stat</span><span class="font3">ing the number of letters you </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">are </span><span class="font3">answering by personal calls, so that we shall have in this office </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a com</span><span class="font3">plete record of the station response. You need not send us the letters </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">you answer </span><span class="font3">by personal call, unless they contain some other matters which must be taken care of by this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Instructions for Ihe reshipping of records were mailed to all those handling the radio programs. If you have not received these instructions from this office, please notify us immediately, so that we may send them to you again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Have</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Service Calendar?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The calendar published by the Society this year is very attractive and every service worker should i have one of these calendars in the home. One of the unique things about this year's calendar is that imderncatli the picture is a letter addressed to the Lord’s anointed and in this letter is outlined the general plan of the service for the entire year. Surely every one of the remnant is Interested In this service plan giving the dates of the special campaign weeks. Also, there is some-thing about a special surprise week. Of course you will wonder what Ibis is ; but you will find out in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">If you have not ordered your (Continued o» page 1, column 4)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">a. part or all of the day off. The 'Thursday drive, then, would be ideal for friends who are thus situated. Housewives can probably arrange to devote Thursday afternoon to the service better than any other </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">week </span><span class="font3">day, due to the fact that the early part of the week is devoted to washing, ironing and bouseelcaning, Wednesday is the midweek day for general shopping and resting up, and Thursday is the time when they are fresh again to take hold of the service. Therefore, with the beginning of January, every service committee should arrange to plan and make provision for a drive every Thursday (morning, afternoon or evening, according to the convenience of the friends), every Saturday afternoon, and every Sunday. Different captains should be appointed to have charge of these drives when the director himself cannot get away. Literature should be available, and territory marked out and definitely assigned, and all incidental preparations necessary for effective witness work should be carefully planned and executed, in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This does not menu, however, that friends who can get away into the service Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or BTiday should not do so. All the anointed should take advantage i of every possible opportunity to witness to the name of the Lord now. The Lord has been pleased to reveal to liis people (through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font3">Books One ami Two) the Kingdom requirements and that this work must be done speedily. If there was any possible excuse for laxity or tardiness in the service prior to 1930, it has been entirely removed by l lie vision the Lord has given us through these two books. It will not any longer do to lie satisfied with setting aside for the Lord’s service our odd times now and then, when we can’t find anything else to do. The lime is come when everything else that can possibly be sidetracked must. be sidetracked, so that the Kingdom service will predominate; and this- must be done in an orderly, systematic manner.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Testimonies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The new arrangement for testimonies has naturally brought up a number of questions. Some of the friends seem to think that because one would have to get as far as saying something about the Kingdom before it could be called a testimony' they should devote ten or fifteen minutes or half :m hour in talking to the people about the Kingdom, and that this constitutes a testimony. While it is true that this does constitute a testimony, it is not the most effective testimony. The most effective testimony is in the literature, and each ono should he able to ascertain after five or six minutes whether there is any prospect of placing the literature with the people. If there is not nay prospect of so doing, the worker should go on to the next party and canvass them. The people cannot remember more than a few hours what tell flwra about the Kingdom, while in all probability if you went on canvassing you would be able to reach somebody who would lake literature and have it in its permanent form but. whom you did not reach </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font3">cause you </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">took a </span><span class="font3">lot </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of time can</span><span class="font3">vassing a party </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font3">was not inter</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The radio work has been a real stimulus to the friends in their canvassing from door to door. Many reports have come to the office telling us that persons have listened </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">and, because of hearing the lectures given by Brother Rutherford, were very ready to take the books offered to them, which go into detail in regard to the purposes of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In each city where there Is a radio station broadcasting these lectures two listeners-in have been appointed. In every case these lis-teners-in should be those who arc physically incapacitated </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to go out </span><span class="font3">In the field service on Sundays, One or two classes have assigned three or four listeners-in. Tins is unnecessary, ami should not be done, because it keeps ihe friends out of the field service. All should make it their business to preach the message from door to door on Sundays, Those </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font3">find it impossible </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to en</span><span class="font3">gage In this branch of the service because of some physical disability should be the ones appointed to listen in. We wish that iu every city the director taking care of these electrial transcription programs would see that these arrangements are made and such persons appointed for listening In. These, then, will make the weekly report on the program, as outlined iu the letter </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">sent by the Society several weeks ago.</span></p>

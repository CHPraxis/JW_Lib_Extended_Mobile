<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneers 25 out of 168?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The estimated number of workers in the Lord's vineyard each week was sei: at 7,000. How may these hope to deliver the greatest number of testimonies during the year in 'preaching this gospel of the Kingdom’, and thus have a part in the vindication of the great name of Jehovah? They are not content, with merely putting in the time in the field, but each one Is striving to do his or her utmost that the widest witness may be given. Anti this will be done by the united, harmonious action of these joyful, willing, eager witnesses as they voluntarily go forth lifting up their voices in the song of praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It can readily be seen that if these witnesses are seven thousand strong, the more often each one of them goes out to give testimony, and the more hours he stays in the held, the more testimonies he will deliver and the greater the scope of the witness will become. All realize that their one and only objective is to give testimony for Jehovah God and his kingdom. To attain tills requires making it the chief thing of their lives, with careful planning so tlicit their time and efforts are really spent in this, their sole mission, and not in other relatively unimportant and unnecessary activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great success had in past weeks set aside as Witness and Testimony weeks has been due to the united, hearty effort put into doing this one thing during such periods. Plans were made in advance and carried out by the Lord’s grace to His glory. The blessing of the Lord which has </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bo</span><span class="font4"> manifestly been upon these efforts shows that they have met with the Lord’s approval. These Witness and Testimony weeks are eminently successful because of the large number of workers who go out Into the field and put in the greatest possible number of hours in giving the testimony. Obviously, then, applying the same principle to each week of the year would also have the Lord’s approval and bring largely increased results in giving testimony. Those who know Jehovah are uot content to be active merely during the appointed Testimony periods, but desire to faithfully fulfil their commission all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Putting this into practice would mean that each one ®f Jehovah’s witnesses must organize his efforts on the most efficient basis, not jnst going out into the field whenever he happens to feel like it or has a little time to spare, but going out at a planned and arranged time to a set place, and joyfully participating in</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Each year the Society publishes a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font4"> and also a calendar. These have been encouraging and helpful to the brethren. The Lord’s anointed should obtain the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font4"> for two reasons. First of all, it contains the report of the activity of Jehovah's witnesses throughout the entire world. The Lord's people reading this report will receive great joy been use they will realize the unity and magnitude of the Lord’s work in the earth. The report is excellent; the Lord has surely blessed his people and added the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Also, as usual, there will be a short discussion of the text for the year, then daily texts, with one for consideration at the declaration meetings on Wednesday evening. The price of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font4"> is 50 cents, due to the fact that a small edition only is printed. It would be appreciated if the stoekkeeper, through the director, would order for the entire company. In this way the books ean be shipped by freight: instead of by mail or express. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book </span><span class="font4">will be ready about December 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A calendar also is being prepared. It is very attractive and it will have outlined on the calendar pad the five united testimony periods for the year. The calendar is offered at the same price as last year, 30 cents each, or in quantities of five or more, mailed to the same address, 25 cents each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">An Answer to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Many Inquirers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From time to time we receive requests for counters for keeping a record of testimonies given and for eases in which to carry the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The address of the manufacturer of the testimony counter which is called a “Golfer’s Pal” is Horm Manufacturing Company, 7 North State St.. Elgin, Illinois. It is sold by them for $1,00. The cases were made by A. Ortman &amp;&nbsp;Son, 39 West GOth Street, New York, N. Y., and their price is $2.75 a case. A money order must be sent with your order for a counter or a case. The Society will not handle any of these orders; the friends desiring these articles must deal direct with the manufacturers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Over 6 Million Pieces of Literature Placed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">‘It Is the Lord’s Doing, and Marvelous in Our Eyes’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The attached report summarizing the .activities of the companies, sharpshooters, pioneers nnd auxiliaries for the year 1931, is the most inspiring and stimulating vision of the Kingdom activities in the United States that it has ever been the privilege of the people of Jehovah to witness. The magnitude of the message, iu the number of testimonies given, the number of people obtaining literature, and the amount of literature distributed, exceeds anything that ever took place lu the past. Happy indeed is the lot of each one of Jehovah’s witnesses who used liis faculties to the extent of his ability in magnifying the name of Jehovah in this way!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The summarized report is such a monument of encouragement that to try to make a detailed analysis of it in this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> would be to limit it to a great degree. Therefore, beyond one or two comparisons of the yearly quota with the accomplishment, we are going to leave the analyzing to be done by each individual and each company, feeling confident that it can be viewed from a. great many different angles and many jnore encouraging features brought out than we would have space for in this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A comparison of the testimonies is important. At the beginning of the year we set a quota of ten naillion testimonies, hardly hoping that it would be attained; but here at the end of the year we find this exceeded by 1,049,344, This means that opproxlmntcly half of the families of the United States have been given the testimony. Of these, 3,308,078 different people obtained literature. This means that practically one in every seven families in the United States obtained the literature of the Kingdom during the past year. The number of hours reached almost three million, 'which, reduced to years, would mean 342 years’ work, working 24 hours a day. Considering these figures, one is overwhelmed with the thought of the magnitude of the witness that the Lord 18 giving in the earth at the present time, and in the words of the psalmist we exclaim, 'It is the Lord's doing, and marvelous in our eyes.’</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The analysis of the combined activities of the companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries for the year 1931 is very encouraging in view of the abnormal conditions that existed throughout the country. Company and sharpshooter reports on the number of testimonies made du ling ihe yea r show a very splendid increase over the quota. At the beginning of the year the quota for the companies and sharpshooters was set at 3,931,200 testimonies. During the year tills group of workers made 5,101,370, or an increase of over 31 percent on what was originally estimated. This was due to the fact that the friends entered into the work with greater enthusiasm than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was estimated that 4,500 workers would be in the field each week (Continued on page 2, column 4)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah purposes to have a witness given in the earth to the glory and honor of his name, and great is the pleasure of his people to make every effort to carry out his will concerning the lesiimony which we know must lie given to the rulers and the people. With joy his people seek to increase their Kingdom interests mid make preparations for extensive campaigns throughout the coming year, so that even more people may hear the truth. The anointed of Jehovah are the leaders of the people. These are already on the highway. Great is their responsibility, because they must now show the people the way from Satan's organization to Jehovah’s organization. Happy is their portion, with the remnant io Hie front, singing the praises of Jehovah. This they must do until his name is completely vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah's witnesses constitute I he publicity agents of God’s kingdom on earth. To these the Lord has committed the testimony of Jesus Christ, and they joyfully obey the commandmerits of Jehovah. God has written in his Word that ‘great is the company that publishes the Kingdom message<sup>1</sup>. Those composing this coni-pariy are riot great in number, but they are great because God has made them so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is always beneficial to make plans and preparations for the work throughout the year, aud therefore we lake pleasure in presenting to the Lord’s people the plans we hope, by the grace of God, to accomplish. Again we will set our quota in testimonies because all can speak forth the word that God lias placed in their mouth as his witnesses. In order to arrive at the number of testimonies which we shall have as a quota we must first consider the workers and the hours they will participate in the field work, and by this method arrive at the total number of testimonies which will be our quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Shortly after the convention nt 1 Columbus, Ohio, there was held a special witness week, during which time I.here were 13,6111 workers actively engaged in witnessing for the Kingdom. Undoubtedly the convention and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> have brought to the attention of those In line for Ilie Kingdom their responsibility, and therefore the average number of workers throughout the past year has been increased. During 1931 there has been an average of 4,733 company workers in the. field. At times there were considerably more workers engaged in the field work, but this was the weekly average. There has been an increase of 357 workers over the previous year. This is an 8-percent Increase, and we can anticipate n 5-peiceut increase in the weekly average number of company workers for 1.932. This would he an addition of 237 workers, bringing the total to 4,970. Our quota for company workers (including sharpshooters) we are therefore setting at 4,950.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers have been very active in the field during the past year. There wa s a weekly average of 1,137 engaged in the field work. This was । mi increase of 199 over the preceding I i year, or a 21-percent gain. During 1932 there should be at least a 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>:</sup> percent increase over 1931. Since the Columbus eon vention applications for the pioneer service have been coming in fast. With an increase of 15 percent it would mean that we would have 171 more weekly pioneers in the work, bringing the weekly average to 1,308 for 1932. Wc therefore set the quota for pioneers at 1,300.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The auxiliaries have also been active in the witness work, and an increase is found in their ranks. During 1931, 603 auxiliaries participated in the work each week, an increase of 149 over the previous year. With the 27-percent increase in the number of workers in the auxiliary ranks last year, we feel certain that there will bo at least a 10-porcent increase in this brunch of the service during 1932. This would add to the weekly average 69 auxiliaries, making a total of 762. Summing up the weekly number of workers in the field we believe there will lie</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">4,950 Company workers 1,300 Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">750 Auxiliaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ora total of 7,000, Weekly Average number of workers for the entire 52 weeks of 1932.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, we hope that sometime during the year it will be possible for all of the Lord's people to, engage In the field work at one time, and therefore we antieipu te reaching a peak of workers during some special testimony period. Due to the fact that we have reached a peak of 13,613 workers engaged in the field at one time, we feel sure that we can again reach that, and even do better. We are therefore setting a peak quota (which we hope to reach tit least once) of 14,000 workers. Of these 14,000, we anticipate that about 11,500 will be company workers and sharpshooters, 1600 pioneers, and 900 auxiliaries. Wo are looking forward to the time when this peak will be reached. It is something to attain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">HOURS IX THE FIELD</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having considered the workers, our next consideration should be given to the hours. II' the Lord's people once realized the imports nee of service they would all be workers. After becoming workers it Is a matter of lime put into the service. The more time one uses in the service, the more testimonies will be given concerning the Kingdom. Time is an essential element in attaining the quota for 1932. During the past year the company workers and sharpshooters averaged 4.9 hours a week. If each of the 4,950 company workers averages six minutes more each week during 1932 they will have an average of five hours each per week. Therefore the company workers and sharpshooters would by the end of the fiscal year put in 1,287,000 hours. The pioneers have not averaged their 25 hours weekly, but we do hope that they will attain the average number of hours per week 'during the coining year. In a year, 1300 of these would put in a total of over 1,550,000 hours. We hope, however, Hint the pioneers w<sup>T</sup>ill find conditions such that they will average over 25 hours mid greatly exceed this total. The auxiliaries also were under the required number of hours, which Is 12 hours per week. Wo anticipate</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">that they will have an increase over the past year and average their 12 hours per week. With 750 auxiliaries averaging their regular hours per week they would put in a total of over 450,000 hours in the year. But, summarizing the hours very conservatively, we suggest the following quota:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Company Workers’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hour Quota &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,250,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pioneers’ Hour Quota &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Auxiliaries’ Hour Quota &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;400,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Total Hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,150,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THE TESTIMONIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year the average number of testimonies given per hour was 3.71 per worker. However, during the months of September and October a rather liberal estimate was made on testimonies because the friends did not know how to report them, and our reports were incomplete on testimonies. Therefore we heli ewe that for 1932 the estimate should be placed at 3.7 per hour per worker. This would make a total of 11,655,000 testimonies which we anticipate will be given to the peoples of the United States. With 7,000 weekly workers putting in 3,150,000 hours we arrive at a quota of 11,500,001) testimonies for 1932. This means approximately 500,000 more testimonies to be delivered than were actually delivered during Hie past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order that the factory might operate efficiently during Hie coming year, a forecast: is drawn up anticipating what the company workers, pioneers and auxiliaries will do during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our estimate, therefore, has been placed at 725,000 clothbound books for the company workers and sharpshooters, and also 2,500,000 booklets. Wo anticipate tliut the pioneers will place 1,275,000 bound books and 2,000,000 booklets. We also figure that the auxiliaries will place 240,000 books and 550,000 booklets. This makes a total of 2,240,000 bound books and 5,050,000 booklets to be placed by the workers, ■ or 7,290,000 pieces of literature during 1932. This, we believe, can lie accomplished by an earnest endeavor on the part, of the 7,000 weekly workers to put: in Hie time, giving the testimonies to the glory and honor of Jehovah's name and word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THE UNITED TESTIMONY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Consistency In the field activity is essential to the life of a Christian. In order for one to ma in lain his integrity and be loyal to the Lord lie must continue faithful to the end by preaching the message. During the year, however, specific periods of time have been set aside for united work, and these are called ‘'united testimony periods”. At this time sill of those wbo are in line for the Kingdom should make a special effort to get all the hours possible in the field work, and with one voice together sing the praises of Jehovah, Unity in action brings splendid results. These united testimony service periods have in the past brought much praise to Jehovah, and a real blessing to his people. During (lie coming year there are set aside five different united testimony periods, arid from time to time the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font4">will bring to your attention these periods and their import. At this time we will but mention the names of these periods for the year, and their dates:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bound Book Testimony Period January 30 to February 7</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">I Intematlonal Testimony Period April 30 to May 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">200,000-IIour Testimony Period July 2 to 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Harvest: Witness Period September 3 to 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Praise Testimony Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. November 12 to 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In each of these testimony periods the witnesses of Jehovah will engage in harmonious publicity, in this, that they are making known Jehovah God, his King, and his Kingdom. In this way the Lord’s people iu every part of the earth will realize that they<sup>7</sup> are working together in exact harmony with their brethren everywhere, and that Christ Jesus is leading on in the great campaign against the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Continued from page 1, column 4) during t he yea r. As the year comes to an end the average number of weekly workers was 4,733; an average of 233 a week more than was anticipated. It was estimated that each worker would average 4.2 hours per week. The end of the year shows that this was increased to 4.9, or almost % of an hour per worker Increase weekly for Hie year. All of this Indicates that the Lord’s people appreciate having a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total literature placed during the year was 567,256 bound books and 2,389,386 booklets, making a total of 2,956,642 pieces of literature placed in 1,637,926 different homes. Tliis Is a mighty witness resounding throughout Hie country to the praise of Jehovah. It is true that comparing the number of hound books placed with that of 1930 allows a drop of over 100,000. However, when it Is kept in mind that during 1930 we placed 168,442 volumes of the Studies </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font4"> against 101,546 during 1.931, it is evident that over 67,000 of this drop iras in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font4"> leaving only </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> difference of 37,0(X) in the newer jr books; and this is more than offset by an increase of almost 885,000 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Viewed from every angle, therefore, as far as the distribution of literature is concerned, 1931 exceeds anything that was ever done up to the present time. Even 1929, with the whole year devoted to the distribution of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend,</span><span class="font4"> did not reach the magnitude of booklet distribution that we reached in 1931. A conservative estimate of the number of families served by tbe companies and sharpshooters the past year would be 25 percent of the families In the United States. There is no way of comparing the number of testimonies with former years; so we cannot make any comparison in that respect. However, the hours arc a barometer which indicates the amount of time devoted to the serv-<sup>!</sup> ice; and witli 1931 showing 1,208,021 hours in the service, we have a peak never before reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most surprising feature in the <sub>:</sub> year’s report is the number of combinations of bound books distributed. During the year 1931, 86,445 combinations -were placed ; and we placed more bound books in combinations during the year than in any year in the past, despite the fact that &quot;conditions were very bad. The drop in number of bound books was In single volumes. This emphasizes the fact that the smaller combination for $1.00 results in a larger distribution of books. Of course, 47,000 combinations of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> books greatly added (Continued on page 4, column 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The summary of the activities from reports received up to the present time shows a total of 118,787 rulers witnessed to in this special way. Of these, 80,453 were clergymen ; 16,726, politicians; 19,995, financiers; and 1,613, military leaders. It is impossible to get actual figures of the number of each one of these classes in the United States. Probably a reasonable estimate for the clergymen of prominence would be about 125,W0. That would mean that two-tbirds of the clergymen of the United States had been witnessed to personally. The other 40,000 probably dwelt in territory not assigned to companies, sharpshooters, pioneers or auxiliaries and will ultimately be reached when the general testimony is given to the people in their vicinity. Probably the same percentage would apply<sup>7</sup> to the politicians, financiers, and military' men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Viewed from every- angle, this is the most .astounding and direct witness that the Lord's people have ever been permitted to deliver; and when the amount of work involved in getting the names and addresses and getting to these people with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet is considered, some idea of the zeal and determination of the Lord’s people to do this work thoroughly and effectively Is obtained.

Not only did this work also have u classifying effect upon those rulers witnessed to who were given an opportunity to accept the testimony of the Lord or reject it, but it also caused those who claim to serve the Lord to manifest whether they really believe that the Kingdom is here, that the time for the Devil’s outfit to be wiped out has come, and that they were especially charged by Jehovah to bring this testimony- to the people.

It is impossible to approximate all the difficulties that will arise'throughout the country' and make one uniform arrangement to meet them all. Local conditions must be considered aud overcome by the brethren in their respective localities. However, there are general conditions that must be met ■and which can be handled pretty uniformly. First, an effort shonid be made for the brethren to witness in the most protected territory available.

The Lord places upon his people the responsibility of delivering this message. I am here according to his instructions to do this work. His commission is found in Ezekiel 3:18, 19, where lie says, ‘When I say unto the wicked, Thou shall surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from bin wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at thine hand.’&quot; Tell him that you are there to discharge this obligation; and if he insists upon refusing you permission to cal! upon the people, ask him if he wishes to assume the responsibility before the Lord of keeping from the people this warning which the Lord says must be given.

<p><span class="font4">Ever since the Columbus convention the 1’aitlilul witnesses of Jehovah have hecn privileged to enjoy one opportunity after another ot giving testimony on a widening scale to the honor of Jehovah’s name. Now the Lord In Ids goodness is giving still smother opportunity which will further prosper the work of his witnesses, in the combination of four clotlibouiKl books, four books for a dollar. There is abundant proof that this is the Ixtrd’s arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the brethren will recall tliat </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of Clod</span><span class="font4"> was 85 cents when first published, due to the fact that a commercial printing concern manufactured them.

In books this was a total of 160,035, or an increase of 67,547 over the work of .the year previous. That this greatly'increased total was due to the four books for a dollar is proven by the fact that over 50,000 of Ihe 160,035 books pl need were in combinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">'I’o further increase the joy and ellieiency of Uis faithful witnesses, Jehovah has given them, in addition to the four-book offer, the united testimony, so that now their song ot praise is indeed a harmonious melody, Thue it is seen that this feature of the testimony, offering the four books for a dollar, has the approval oi' Ihe Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are many advantages to this offer which the witnesses of Jehovah mil appreciate as they go forth in the held. First, that the Lord takes pleasure in the united, harmonious action of his people. 'This they are doing by all working shoulder’ to shoulder offering the testimony to the people in the same form, and with the same oral testimony. Second, tlie witnesses laid aside their usual work of giving testimony and in obedience to the Lord’s command served a notice of warning on the preachers, poliri-eians and financiers, and now they nrc glad to be again calling upon the people in their homes, placing the printed testimony in their hands which will enable those of good will to hike their stand on tlie side of Jehovah, and to be the recipients of his blessings. After calling upon the preachers, it is a pleasure indeed to return to the house-to-house testimony work. Third, the reduction in the cost of the books, so that I hey may be offered at four for a dollar, is a big advantage, due to the adverse economic conditions. Also, the people have been in the habit of spending a dollar, and even two dol-ple and deliver to them the testimony, Also Saturday afternoon is generally a half day for office and factory workers, and, in fact, now many people do not work at all on Saturday. This affords a splendid opportunity for finding them at home. During the summer they might go away on week-end trips, but now, with the inclement weather, the majority will be found at home. This, too, is the season of the year most favorable for reading.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The front-line workers, the pioneers, are in the field every day, but tlie auxiliaries, company workers and sharpshooters can so lay out their home duties as to avail themselves of tlie most seasonable time to give the witness in the territory which the Lord has entrusted to them. For instance, if it is found that in some sections the people arc not at home in the afternoon, work in that section should be carried on when they are at home. The rural territory should be witnessed to at the most favorable time, when the roads are passable, crops in and disposed of, and the people are in position to receive the testimony. City territory, with its apartments, and houses close together, may be kept available for stonuy weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this way each witness, after determining just how to arrange his personal or home affairs in an orderly manner so as to be able to devote the greatest amount of time to his real work in Jehovah’s vineyard, may plan his work in the field so as to efficiently use the time to the Lord’s glory and honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Continued from page 2, column 4) to the number of smaller combinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Taken as a whole, the companies show a degree of efficiency never before manifested in the manner in which they report. Out of the 627 companies, 622 organized for service are now reporting regularly. In making this analysis of the year's activities, the foreign and colored companies and sharpshooters should not be overlooked. Every one of them did splendid work in their respective field. The friends speaking a foreign tongue are becoming :«:-cusl.orned to witnessing to Englishspeaking people as well as to people speaking their own tongue, and find it just as easy to get results. The method with the card containing the testimony to be presented to the people and read by them has been found to be a great success in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">PIONEERS AND AUXILIARIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fiscal year 1031 came to a close finding the pioneers and auxiliaries rejoicing in the Lord's service as never liefore. We find an increase of 199 pioneers and 149 auxiliaries each week in the service over that of former years. It was estimated that, the pioneers would put in 1,222,000 hours during the year. We find as tlie year has corne to a close that they exceeded this by over 130,000. Their total for the year was 1,354,011 hours. It was estimated that ihe auxiliaries would put: in 341,250 houra; and their reports show 387,400 hours, or over 46,000 increase for the year. This would represent 4,888,000 testimonies for the pioneers and 1,4o6,146 for the auxiliaries. Tlie report for the year shows a slight drop in the number of testimonies given by the pioneers. Their total J was only 4,431,828 for the year, evi-deutly due to the fact that much of the work done by Ihe pioneers is in sparsely settled territory and they find It difficult to maintain an average of four testimonies an hour. ■ However, they came so close to reaching their quota Unit it can practically be said that they attained it, while the auxiliaries went over their total by almost 100,000. The combined testimonies of the companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries greatly exceed the 10,000,000 quota for tlie year.</span></p>

They are accustomed to paying as . much us 25c to rental libraries for merely the use of a single book that they have to return al. the end of a few days, which is substantially the whole cost of one ot the bound books. Popular magazines cost, from 10c to 35c a copy, and are filled with advertisements and frivolous reading of negative value. At best these provide but a few minutes’ reading, and do not supply what the people really need. Now the people are tired of reading unprofitable fiction, and, too, they can no longer afford it, and the Lord in his goodness gives his servant the privilege of taking them four books for less than they would expect to pay for one, and, above all, containing life giving food (Luke 4:4; ITov. 4:20-22), in contrast with what they have been reading. And, fourth, where it is impossible for the people to take the four books for a. dollar, or where they already have the oilier bound books, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet may be offered to them at 45c. These are but some of the many advantages that the brethren tire enjoying in the offer of the four books for a dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On every hand there is unemployment and suffering. Banks are closing and the future is uncertain for the people. This causes them to seek light pleasures, such as dancing and moving pictures, and much riding about in automobiles, in an endeavor to forget their worries. Such amusements cost a great deal of money, rind the people, even in these hard limes, are wasting their money for these thingsand receiving absolutely no benefit in return, Jehovah's witnesses, appreciating the real need of the people, and knowing positively that their relief is to come only from the Lord’s kingdom, should bear this in mind when calling upon the people; and it will be of great aid to them in properly witnessing and leaving will) them the printed testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, too, the use of the Testimony published in the November 1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> is of great assistance in placing the four books for a dollar. The sentence concerning contributing one dollar for the four makes the people feci that they are having a share in the work, thus pulling them in the right condition for beginning to read Hie message contained therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Inileed the faithful witnesses feel like following the counsel of David, in Psalm 3-5:27, and shouting for joy, being giml, for they do favor the Lord's righteous cause, and their sole desire is to see the name of the Lord magnified. We may confidently expect, then, that the Lord will prosper their work in giving the testimony, for ‘He hath pleasure In the prosperity of ills servant'.</span></p>

To this end each witness must put his owu affairs in order and allot certain hours on specified days for actual field testimony.

<p><span class="font4">As with the companies and sharpshooters, there was a drop in the number of bound books placed by the pioneers during tlie past year. It was estimated that they would place 1,300,000; but they reached only 974,1X10, leaving them about 330,000 short. However, they exceeded their quota of booklets by over 300,000, making their grand total for the year 2,762,583 pieces of literature, which is an increase of 62,583 on what was originally estimated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The auxiliaries also did splendid work in placing literature, although they found conditions similar to those found by the others and did not reach their quota of bound books. It was estimated that they would place about 240,000 clothbound books; and they placed only 176,003, leaving them about 64,000 short. However, their estimate for booklets was 3.50,000 and they reached 511,-1&lt;8, showing an increase of over 161,000 on the booklets. Their grand total for the year, therefore, was almost 100.000 more than the quota.</span></p>

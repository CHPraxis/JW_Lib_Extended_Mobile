Insert these slips between pages 2 and 3. Put a little paste on the back side of the upper left hand corner so that it will stick to page 3 and not fall out when handled.

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>To Jehovah’s witnesses</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">1 My beloved Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I Jehovah has laid upon his anointed witnesses the obligation of giving warning to official Christendom. This must bo done fearlessly and boldly. Many of the clergymen, some of the । politicians and some of the financial giants will frown upon I you. They will look at you with a fierce and angry countenance I and doubtless will speak harshly to you. Do not be at all * disturbed or alarmed by reason of their looks or words. You • have a duty to perform. You arc Jehovah’s witnesses and &gt;&nbsp;hence bis representatives. “Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; I and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he ! shall be for a. sanctuary. ” (Isa. 8:13,14) Remember that ; J chovah says to his anointed: ' ‘ Behold, I have made thy face ■ strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against ; their foreheads. As an adamant harder than flint have I made I. thy forehead: fear </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">them</span><span class="font3"> noh, neither bn </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">disma</span><span class="font3">yed at their, looks, though they be a rebellious house. Moreover ho said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. And go, get thee to them . . . and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord God; whether they will hear, or whether</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">i they will forbear.”—Ezek, 3:8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official part of Christendom is made up of political</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">: and commercial leaders and the clergymen and other religious leaders. When approaching any of these be calm, dignified and respectful. Under no circumstances be rude or harsh. Do not enter into any controversial argument. That is not the work to be done now. You are process servers. When approaching a clergyman say this: “Good day. This is Doctor Johnson I believe. You arc the pastor of the Baptist church. As a witness of Jehovah I have conic to deliver to you a notice concerning Uis expressed purpose. It is of very great importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">: I have the privilege of handing you this copy. If it. is convenient for you to give me five cents to help defray the expenses</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">i I shall thank you.” Hand him a copy of the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The ; Kingdom, the Hope of the World.</span><span class="font3"> If he gives you tho five 1 cents, take it. If he docs not?give him the booklet anyhow, ! and do not discuss matters. Immediately take your departure and go to the next. If it is refused, lay it down near him and go away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Calling at the office of sonic public official say: “I have the privilege, I believe, of addressing Judge Muldoon. I have a message for you, and as one of Jehovah’s witnesses I have come to deliver it to you. Thus wc are preaching the gospel as the Lord has commanded. It contains a message of greatest importance to you. I hope you will profit by reading it. I sliall be glad to receive from you five cents for this copy.” : Hand him the booklet. If he refuses to give you the five cents leave the booklet with him anyhow and quickly withdraw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Go into the banks and other financial institutions, ask first to see the president on a matter of importance. If asked about what you wish to see him, say it. is personal. Say to the bank</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Work Among Rulers Calls for Special</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Should Like to Know How Many Have the Warning</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is an important work to be done, and each of those who love the Lord will be anxious to do Ills part. So that wo may know Just what has been done among the rulers a special report card has been made up upon which we risk each company of Jehovah's witnesses to make out a full and complete report on October 31. One ot' these cards is being enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> for each service director, and the same is being sent to each sharpshooter and Tjoncvr mnr auxi 11 ary Teipurtvtnv bo ■ that [here may be no duplication in the figures, directors Should not Include in their report any work done among the rulers\b.v any of the auxiliary or pioneer .colporteurs who might be w or kink in their territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order that this report may be accurate, wc ask that every worker who participates in this special service tie sure to make his report. IE you arc not a colporteur or a sharpshooter, then be sure to give your report to the service director, so that his report to the Society may be complete. If you ore a colporteur or a sharpshooter keep a careful record of the booklets placed with the rulers and fill out your card on October 31 and then send It to us immediately, so that we can start the tabulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The August </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> tells you about the Information which is called for on this report; but so that all will have it in mind wc repeat it here. There are the following headings on the card, under which the total number of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdoni</span><span class="font3"> booklets ONLY which arc placed with the respective rulers are to be reported: </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Clergymen and other religious leaders Politicians, judtM^, and high public officials</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Financiers: Officers of banks and big corporations</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Military: Army or navy officers of high rank</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Of these booklets placed with rulers, how many were left free?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As stated in Brother Rutherford’s letter, the Society will credit yon for booklets which you have left with these rulers without their having paid you 5 cents for their copy. If you will report under the last heading the number thus left this will assure you of receiving Ihe proper amount of credit. To get credit, be sure to fill out report.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>International Service Convention Week Report Interesting</span></h4>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>23,970 Workers in the Field</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">When the command was given by Gideon for the three hundred to blow upon their trumpets and to shout, “The Sword of the Lord and of Gideon,” they acted In unison and obeyed joyfully. In&quot; like manner when the Lord showed his people through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> that the time had come for a special effort to be made during International Service Week, they joyfully responded throughout the earth. Just glance at the table below if you want to see bow the echoes of the great convention at Columbus were heard around the world. Even this incomplete report shows that over million people were personally called upon by Jehovah’s witnesses and given a testimony to the honor of Jehovah's name. Not only did the people in the United States receive this message, but also some in far-off India and Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time has eome when Jehovah’s witnesses can joyfully press on and can realize that their brethren in every part of the earth are working together shoulder to shoulder in the greatest cause under the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The table below will be of great interest to all of Jehovah's witnesses. It gives some idea of the wide extent of the work Jehovah is permitting them to enjoy. Not all of the reports have been received yet, but the ones given are sufficient to fill our hearts with praise and thanksgiving. It is hardly be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■L’U-y-fc QU ,070 T'Vbrtvcib’ci witnesses, scattered all over the earth, could be so well organized as to carry on a campaign such as was carried on during International Service Week, that great week of surprises. Think of tire large number of people that were met, of the witness that was given by the song of praise which was sung, and of the literature that was left in the hands of the people, pointing them to the Kingdom. Then remember that all this work was done during this one week only, that this is but an incomplete report, and that you are privileged to be serving with your brethren in the greatest cause there is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This could only be Jehovah’s doing. Aren’t you glad that you had a part in this special effort?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A check-up of the activities of companies, sharpshooters and colporteurs in the United States is difficult to make. A great many of those participating in the service at the Columbus convention apparently did not report their activities to their home director and consequently he did not Include them in his week's report to the Society. Because of this there is a considerable difference In the two sets of figures. The Columbus convention report shows 7,231 workers participating in the service, distributing over 390,000 pieces of literature and making 391,000 testimonies, whereas the reports for Surprise Week show only a total of 9,205 workers distributing 170,116 pieces of literature and making 220,753 testimonies. When we realize the fact, that over 12,000 workers participated in Watchtower Week in Stay, there is every reason to expect that as a result of the stimulus of the convention many who did not take active part in the service formerly entered into the field at that time.</span></p>

The world is in distress and perplexity and even greater things shall shortly follow. In this way we are preaching the message of God’s kingdom as he has commanded. To help defray the expense of this publication I shall be pleased to take five cents from you for this copy.” Hand him the booklet. Whether he pays for it or not, leave it. You may be told that no canvassing is permitted in the bank, and to that reply: “I am not canvassing, but merely bringing you this information which Jehovah has commanded. Responsibility is on you as to whether or not you take it.” Do not argue further. Then, in turn, call on other officials in the bank and in like manner present each one with a copy of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Keep a record of all the booklets that you are compelled to deliver free or without receiving the five cents. Send us a statement of same and the Society will give you credit for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This work of serving notice on official Christendom is set for a special time. In fioing abtyit you will come in contact with the common people. To such say: “All the world is in distress and you are wondering why and what is to come to pass in the near future. It is my privilege as one of Jehovah 's witnesses and in obedience to his commandment to deliver to the people a message. Thus I am preaching the gospel. I have here a booklet containing the message. It is only five cents. You cannot afford to be ignorant of its contents. This is your copy, and I will take five cents to help defray the expense of publishing more. ’'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This witness work must be done quickly and thoroughly. Each company or individual to whom territory is assigned should sec that every house in that territory is canvassed. When you find no one at home make a note of the street and number of that house, and as soon as convenient call back and sec that every person gets an opportunity to hear. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">B ulletin </span><span class="font3">heretofore stated how’ you may obtain the names of the clergymen. See that you do not miss any of them. Remember that God has laid the obligation upon his people to serve this notice and it must be done. Read carefully Ezekiel 3:17-21. Do not delay in performing this special service, and as quickly as your territory is completed make report thereof to the service department at Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Be of good courage at all times and rejoice and give thanks to Jehovah that you have part in the work of thus serving him.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Bethel Family Placed 19,403 in First 4 days</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The first returns from the Witness Week activities covering the four days from September 4 to 7 at points at which Bethel brethren served indicate that this campaign exceeds any other that has taken place up to the present time. For the 45 companies of Jehovah’s witnesses served by these brethren (luring that, week-end we have a total of 1.155 workers, placing 54,386 booklets, or an average of 47 booklets per worker, and the week only well started. At that rate undoubtedly the average of 100 booklets per worker will be very easily reached for the entire week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The report for the Bethel family covering the same period shows 194 workers in the field, placing 19,403 pieces of literature, or slightly over 100 pieces per worker for this period. We believe that one of the real reasons why the Bethel family exceeded the other brethren in the number of booklets placed during this period is the fact that they unanimously used the canvass for the common people as quoted in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font3"> and the testimony of each one upon returning was to the effect that this was the most effective and thorough canvass they have ever used; and 54 percent of the people to whom they witnessed took the booklet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Notice</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The message contained in the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World</span><span class="font3"> is of such vital importance that it is absolutely necessary to place those booklets throughout the territory. Many of the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses find it impossible to cover all of their territory in the short period of time allotted, and therefore Brother Rutherford is extending the time for the distribution of this booklet another month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This notice and warning to the rulers and the people must be given, and if you cannot complete your territory by October 1 continue with this work until October 31. Order sufficient booklets now to cover your territory thoroughly. The Lord has commissioned you to do this work. It is your privilege to do it faithfully and thoroughly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(Continued from 1st Column) This would indicate that the tfeifft *-*' workers for Surprise Week were more than there were out during Watchtower Week in May. Consequently there are between three thousand and four thousand workers who have not sent in their reports for their activity at the Columbus convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because of this it is impossible to give the exact number of testimonies, workers, hours and pieces of literature placed. The indications are, however, that this has been the most successful campaign of all time in this country, and undoubtedly the total testimonies, if they could be ascertained accurately, run about half a million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We feel disappointed that we did not get accurate reports from all participating in this week’s activities so that we could let you have Hits information at Ibis time.</span></p>

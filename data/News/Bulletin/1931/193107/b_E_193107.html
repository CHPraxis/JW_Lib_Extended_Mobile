<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Surprise Week Will Be a Convention Week for All</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">On to Columbus! Thrilled with the prospects of another great international convention, the anointed throughout the earth arc turning their thoughts towards Columbus and earnestly seeking the Lord’s blessing upon this assembly of God's people. Every effort is being made by them to lie present if they possibly can. The Society, believing that this convention Is to be of such great importance, has made arrangements for assisting those who have been in the full-time service for at least six months to he present. Judging from the letters being received, almost all the pioneers will be there, together with the class workers and auxiliaries, to add their voices to the song of praise which will be lifted up to the honor of Jehovah's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are, of course, some who have the real desire to attend but for one reason or another just cannot. The Lord in his goodness has made it possible for them also to share in this same convention, which will be tlie greatest, one ever held. Surprise Week is not to be confined to the conven tf oners at Columbus, but. it is for the anointed throughout the entire earth. All of these will be engaging in the convention itself by engaging in tlie convention service. This is the first time that such a service week has been planned. This is the first time that extension conventions following the general convention have been arranged so that the echoes of that great gathering may be heard throughout: the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While at tiie present time we may not understand the full significance of tliis week and convention, still as the anointed of the Lord unite together with a sincere desire to be used by the Lord to the honor of fits name, they can confidently roly upon Jehovah to do so. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> lias shown us how he has used his people iri times past, and now the Esther articles in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Toicer </span><span class="font3">have been proving to us beyond a shadow of doubt that even though we stand in a perilous position, will, the enemy conspiring against us none of tlie enemy shall prosper. Wlmt more could be asked?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If a week ever was a success in the heralding forth of the Kingdom message, Surprise Week should be. If the anointed of the Lord have been rejoicing in their privilege of singing forth the praises of Jehovah tn times past, the very prospects of Surprise Week should overwhelm them with delight. This convention is to be for all of the anointed on earth, and one in which ah can share. If you cannot, actually be at Columbus you can </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">engage</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the </span><span class="font3">convention service by carrying the Kingdom message to the people its your own territory. Surprise Week is a service week ns well as a convention week, and one for heralding far and wide the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The service work at Columbus itself and elsewhere will commence with the final distribution of the remaining leaflets advertising the great radio hook-up for Sunday. The combinations of stations broadcasting the lecture on that occasion will make it the greatest broadcast in the history of radio. Then will come the great onward march of the Lord’s people with the Kingdom message In book form. Hie special offer during the Surprise Week is to be 3 books for $1.00, or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light </span><span class="font3">1-2 and fonr booklets, dropping down to the four booklets for a quarter when the party cannot take the entire combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tlie Columbus convention is to be a convention of workers who will go there because they want to serve as witnesses to the honor of Jehovah’s name. The great convention will conclude with the extension meetings which will he held throughout the earth and which will he attended not only by the ones who have actually been at Columbus Itself but by otlicrs who have not. These meetings also are for workers, and much time will be devoted to the actual Held service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">What a Surprise Week it will be I Never before in the history of the church or in the history of the world will there have been such a convention, siteii unity of action and singleness of purpose.

Time in the field and the number of testimonies given mean that more and more the people are being educated concerning Jehovah and his kingdom that they may lake their stand on his side and receive the blessings of his kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">May Witness a Splendid One</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">47 % of Month’s Activity Done in 10 Days</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Interesting Comparisons</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Made with Remaining 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A study of the figures for the May witness reveals a number of interesting points in the field service activities. Watchtower Week, which resulted in one of the most stupendous and effective witnesses ever given, was a part of May’s activities. We find In making an examination that during the ten days of Watchtower Week the classes, colporteurs and sliarpshooters made 47 percent of the total testimonies and put in 47 percent of the horn's and made 47 percent of the placements, placing 49 percent of the total of pieces of literature for the month. During the other 21 days only 53 percent of the testimonies, hours and placements were made, and 51 percent of the total literature placed. The uniformity in hours, testimonies, placements and literature in this respect is very impressive, and establishes the fact that when the workers put in the time the testimonies will be made aud this will result in an established percentage of placements and when w<sup>T</sup>e drop oft in the number of hours put in the service there is an exactly uniform drop in the number of testimonies we give, the placements made, and the total of pieces of literature disposed of. Tlris deserves the careful and prayerful consideration of each cue of the Lord’s anointed. There is no doubt that the Lord is revealing these facts to us at this time for our individual and collective examination, for we are all a part of that one body which has received Ihe commission from Jehovah to be his witnesses. Consequently the question each one should ask himself Is this: Why is it that we put in ouijas much time in 21 days as we did in the 10 days of Watchtower Week? and then we should examine ourselves and check up and compare how much time we put in in Watchtower Week and how much time we put in during the remainder of the month. While It is true that all put forth additional effort during these special drives to devote additional time to the Kingdom service, It is questionable, however, whether they devote twice as much time as they ordinarily could devote to the Kingdom work, and it may be found in a great mauy eases that if we put forth the effort and carefully check up our responsibilities we can devote considerably more time than we arc now giving to the service work and thus increase the number of hours in the service, which will result in a corresponding increase in the number of testimonies given, placements made, and pieces of literature disposed of. The number of books and booklets placed during Watchtower Week, compared with that of the rest of the month, shows that 58 percent of the hound books were placed during Watchtower Week and only 42 percent placed during the other 21 days. Of course, the additional books in the dollar combinations were bound to affect this splendid increased distribution, However, added to tbis splendid offer was the enthusiasm of the friends, which, we believe, aided greatly toward the success of this Watchtower Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is well at this time to consider</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">a comparison of the progress thal is being made toward attaining the quota for the year 1931. With the ! end of May, eight months, or 66ii percent of the time is gone, leaving only 33a percent of the year yci. to go. During that period we have to place 930,499 bound hooks, or 414 percent of our book quota, anti 747,752 booklets, or 22 J, percent of the booklet quota. This makes a total of 1,678,251 pieces of literature to be placed in the hands of the people before the end of September 1931 in order to attain to our quota for the year. We are well ahead in booklets, ami that places us ahead on the total of pieces of literature, but we are considerably behind in the bound books; consequently It is going to require a more concentrated effort in presenting the bound-book combinations during the remainder of the year In order ti reach our objective. However, we feel confident that if each cue will do his part, concentrate on the bound books, present I hem enthusiastically, we shall come very close to attaining, if we don't actually accomplish, our quota of bound books. This does not mean, of course, that ihe booklets are not to be presented where the people are unable to hike the bound books. Every elTori should be made to leave the bound books with the people, but where this cannot be accomplished, then you should drop to the booklets.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">All pioneer colporteurs attending the Columbus convention are asked to register at once upon their arrival at the Colporteur Booth, which will he in the main coliseum. There they will be given an identification card which will entitle them to receive books from the book store at pioneer rates. As heretofore, all transactions at the book store will be curried on on the cash basis and special rales will be granted to pioneer colporteurs only. Therefore it will not be necessary for auxiliary colporteurs to register or to get identification cards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If pioneers wish to receive the special allowance which the Society has made for those who have been meeting the full-time requirements for six months or over, their personal signature on the convention records will be necessary.

For the Lord your God is he that goetli with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord God placed this assurance in his Word that we might lay hold and act upon it in the day of ball Ie. Every one of God’s anointed should have some part in the bombardment he Is about to make on the enemy’s stronghold. Go to Columbus, if possible. If you cannot do that, then try to attend some one of the Columbus convention extensions, July 31 to August 2, Every provision is made for a very thorough and complete witness to be given at these points. Each one will be served by representatives of the Society. Halls, territory, literature and rooming accommodations are being carefully planned in advance for these points as well as for Columbus. A complete list of all the detsiils will he given at Columbus for the convenience of those who will attend there. For those who are unable Io attend at Columbus, but who are arranging to attend the convention extensions, we are listing herein the places, languages and direel ors’ names and addresses, so that they cun communicate with the brethren at whatever point they intend to be and make their ar-rangeiuents in advance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We have received word from many parts of the country that arrangements have already been made to have 'radios installed in parks and In band concert stands. Also trucks are being equipped with radios to go teuwhere people congregate so thar all may have an opportunity to hear. Those who are making such arrangements should also see that notice is put in the newspapers informing the people where they may hear this epochmarking address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The importance of this great broadcast cannot be overstressed. Those at Columbus as well as those who remain at home will be sure to listen in. If you arc one of the latter and if you do not have a radio set, find someone who lias and who will let you listen to the lecture over his set. Workers as well as everyone else should set aside this hour. When it is over, or Sunday morning prior to the lecture, you can get out into the field service. But, by all means, do not miss the lecture. The encouragement which you will personally receive from the message itself and the realization that the message is being carried over 400 different stations will embolden you to press on in the battle and sing out the praises of Jehovah God. Since Surprise Week Is a special service week, it means that all the Lord’s anointed everywhere will be putting forth strenuous efforts to follow up this great broadcast with a personal witness to as many people as possible.</span></p>

Pioneer colporteurs will be able to secure books at the Columbus Convention at pioneer rates for the convention service there, but this arrangement is not being made for the extension conventions.

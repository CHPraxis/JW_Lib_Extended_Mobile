<p><span class="font4">The figures for the “Midwinter Week” are now compiled, and as? we review<sup>7</sup> them we marvel and rejoice in Hie way of the Lord. The comparison is with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Prophecy </span><span class="font4">Week”, which took place at the same season last year. This reveals 108,873 pieces of literature distributed by the classes and sharpshooters, compared with 63,149 during the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> Week”, in 1930, an Increase of over </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7'2</span><span class="font4"> percent. The increase was entirely on the booklets. We had a drop of 7,246 bound books, due mostly to the fact that Lhe friends specialized on the single book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">PropJtccy</span><span class="font4"> last year, to the exclusion of the other books and booklets. This was more than offset, however, by ihe increase of approximately 53,060 booklets. This year we placed the Kingdom message in over 5,000 more homes during the week than we did lust year. These results, however, are not the real basis of comparison but they manifest liow the I,ord blessed the effort put forth. The number of hours worked is what lests the real zeal of (he Lord's witnesses. This year 57,031 hours were worked, against 30,172 hours during </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Prophecy </span><span class="font4">Week”, an increase of 26.859 hours, or S9 percent. There was an increase of 1.842 workers, 29 percent, and the workers out during the drive averaged seven hours each, against four and three-quarters hours each last year. Viewed from every angle this is the greatest midwinter witness to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The real acid test came in the placements. Last year the friends were able to place literature in ouc home every 40 minutes, against one home in every 70 minutes this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few years back, or even one year ago, the friends could not have stood this test; they would have become discouraged and quit But now they see clearly another great wonder in heaven, as outlined in Revelation 15. They know that it isn’t the number of books placed that counts, nor the number of people who will he blessed by the truth they bring, but. that the great issue (Continued on pii’i: :i, column 3)</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>9,968 Workers Went Forth That Week</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">“Midwinter Week&quot; turned out to be a glorious time for the anointed in the United States, for throughout tiie major portion of the country the weather was exceptionally favorable for the workers. Instead of having all tho snow and ice, for which preparations had been made, many of the reports tell us that the weather was so mild and the roads so dry that tiie workers took advantage of these conditions to get out into tho rural sections. But while there were pleasant days for carrying on the work, other obstacles for placing the literature were confronted. Louder and louder has grown the cry of “hard times” throughout the land as January closed with the number of business failures breaking all records. This caused many to listen hungrily to the comforting message brought to their doors and even to dig up their last dime in order to get u booklet. We are already beginning to hear from some who have been refreshed by their having received some of the -water of life during tills week. One party writes: &quot;Gentlemen: This past week I purchased two volumes of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> from a lady who visited my place. I think the books are marvelous. The subject matter has been of interest to me for a number of years. 1 would like to Inquire if I can make arrangements to take up the sale of your line of books, as I am interested in such a mission.” Having received of the -water of life, he immediately wants to share It with others.</span></p>

Instead of 7,663 reporting, as during the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> Week” of last year, 9,968 workers were on the job. All the workers (class and pioneer and auxiliary colporteurs) took advantage of the good weather and put in ou the average from 1.5 to 3 hours more time during the week. This resulted in a total of 105,807 hours devoted to the witness work instead of only 64,400, as of last year. That is some increase and, of course, resulted in many more people hearing about the kingdom. As a matter of fact, the total number of testimonies then reported was 383,347, which is another good boost toward the 10,000,000 quota for the year. The increased work and workers resulted in literature being left in 87,934 homes ns compared with 74,808 during 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last year surpassed this year’s “Midwinter Week” in total books placed, with a total of 72,663 books, as compared with this year’s figure of 61.97(5, but the way the booklets soared ahead makes the total amount of literature placed for the week of 1931 far in advance of last year. With 143,693 booklets distributed, instead of 59,845, the total books and booklets for “Midwinter Week” of 4934 numbers 205,609, ns compared with 132,508 of last year, or an increase of 73,161 pieces. Surely this is a cause for great rejoicing on the part of the anointed. However, that which we believe is most appreciated by the Lord is the Increased effort which has been put forth in the field in giving the testimony to the honor of his name. It is the putting forth of the effort that is really increasing the Kingdom interests which the Lord has committed to his servants; and when one diligently strives to do more to the honor of Jehovah's name, such -works, backed by faith, are sure of the Lord's approval.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">What did the colporteurs do during &quot;Midwinter Week”? Well, they entered the work with their customary zest and enthusiasm, taking advantage of the opportunity of uniting with the rest of the consecrated throughout the eartli who were putting forth a special effort to show forth the Lord’s praises. It pleases us very much to see how more pioneers and more auxiliaries reported as being right there on the job than during </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> Week” of last year. You will be interested in knowing that reports were received from 1,086 pioneers and 760 auxiliaries instead of only 889 pioneers and 494 auxiliaries. Not only were there more colporteurs in the field, but these individually averaged more time. Instead of an average of only 30.04, as of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> Week”, the pioneers averaged 33.20 hours and the auxiliaries increased their average from 15.23 to 16.74. That resulted in many more hours given to the work, a large number of testimonies given, and literature left in the homes of more people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just look at the table ami see what good -work was done.

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Radio Check-up to Be Made</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Commencing UTiday, May S, and running up to and including Sunday, May 17, is &quot;Watchtower &quot;Week”. This will afford another opportunity for a special effort to magnify the name of Jehovah. The evidences of the Lord's approval and blessing upon the “Midwinter Week” is positive proof of the J-ord’s pleasure in this method of special periodic efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “Watchtower Week” is going to have au additional and very important feature, anil that is where it gets its name. For six months preceding this special drive the Watchtower International Electrical Transcription Program will have been carrying Brother Rutherford's lectures to the English-speaking world through more than 207 radio slations, IDO of which are in the United States or United Stales possessions. During this special campaign we are asking all workers to make a special note of all placements of literature which were made as a result of the radio messages which the people heard. Therefore, during this drive each one should arrange to place a special mark after each placement made as a result of the radio. We have no special recommendation as to how each director should gather this information, but there should lie a uniform method in each eccle-sia. The director should definitely instruct the workers of his particular class how to mark the slips so that the one compiling the weekly report will have no difficulty in taking the information from the slips. For illustration, the capital letter “K&quot; might be placed after each radio placement to identify it as a placement resulting from the radio messages heard by the obtainer. It is a simple matter to mark the slips. The big thing is to remember to do it. Each one should get the habit of associating the name “Watchtower Week” with the “International Watchtower Program” and the ascertaining of the information which will show the effect of the radio in the placement of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This campaign will also have the effect of coordinating the two great publicity branches of the lord’s organization, the house-to-bouse service and the radio. The people should be made to understand that you are the one who Brother Rutherford told them would call on them with tire literature. The fact that each transcription record carries some statement advising the people that the Lord's witnesses will call upon them witii the Kingdom literature is not a mere accident. Without question the Lord directed it. That being true, we must realize that, not only Brother Rutherford, but the Lord himself, has gone on record before the people that yon, his witnesses, would call on them. Therefore be sure to make yourself known as the Kingdom representative and the one who they were advised over the radio would call on them. “Watchtower Week” will therefore witness another definite forward step in coordinating the different branches of the Lord’s organization in the field, More and more the testimony of God’s prophet Is finding fulfilment in the Lord’s anointed. They ‘lift up the voice and with the voice </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">together</span><span class="font4"> they sing to the Lord’s praise’. To the tardy and backward ones the Lord says, “Break forth into joy, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sing together,</span><span class="font4"> ye waste places of Jerusalem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From March 2S to about June 1 is planting-time among the farmers. Our “Watchtower Week” is in the midst of this period. The farmer is busy on the land. His money is being spent for seed and help and he is generally in a frame of mind where he will not consider spending on anything but his crops. During the same period the small towns are doing a fairly good business. What spending the farmer does is done with these, for implements, food, seed, etc., and is done mostly in the evening because he Is too busy during the day. Each service committee should therefore commence now to arrange for territory for this drive, concentrating on the farm towns particularly. A lot of “spying out the land” can be done in advance. Therefore Start discussing ways and means now. Plan the details early, and order plenty of supplies in advance. Next </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> will carry more details regarding the plan of action.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Have you read the letter dated February 16, which the Society mailed to all the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> subscribers in the United States? Even more thau this, have you read the February 1 and 15 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Towers? </span><span class="font4">Toil surely missed a treat if you didn’t. This special letter was addressed “To All of God’s Temple Workers”, and pointed out the necessity of being a builder of the temple. It brought to you the high points of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> article. We would suggest that, if you have not made some definite decision in regard to your part in the Lord’s work, you read .this letter over again, and especially the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Towers</span><span class="font4"> for February 1 and 15, To those who are actively engaged in the service this message will bring great joy and pleasure. To those who are not active, or who are not as active as they should be, it will probably bring an appreciation of some things they have not fully realized before. As this letter says, “The time is past for those to whom God has committed his kingdom interests to be fiddling away their time and energy in fussing with firewood and kindling. Sturdy logs and beams and joists are needed, and to bring them in requires what each one devoted to the Lord has agreed to give, 100 percent of mind, heart, soul mid strength.” The Lori! said, &quot;Be strong, all ye people of the land [remnant], and work; for I am with you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These two </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Towers</span><span class="font4"> (and we believe there will be another one on this subject March 1) are of vital importance to every one of the Lord's anointed. They point out that</span></p>

In fact the total number of testimonies given by the pioneers numbered 118,432, and by the auxiliaries 47,567. The literature was left in the homes of 29,120 people by the pioneers, as compared with 23,839 during the previous winter week. The auxiliaries increased their placements from 7,059 to 9,731.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another interesting feature of this report is, of course, the amount of literature placed. While we are primarily concerned with the giving of the witness, ail realize that tire best way for anyone to come to a real understanding of God’s truth is to read and prove the things which he reads from the Bible. Hence it is a cause for rejoicing to sec an increase in the amount of literature placed with the people. The hard times resulted in fewer bound books distributed, the pioneers dropping from 32,485 during </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> Week” to 29,695 during “Midwinter Week”, and the auxiliaries falling from 7,378 to 6,727.

The pioneers jumped from 25,495, as during </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> Week”, to 45.186, and the auxiliaries from 4,001 Io 15,188. ’Illis, of course, resulted in a much greater number of total pieces of literature distributed. The total for the pioneers increased from 57,980 to 74.881, and for the auxiliaries from 11,379 to 21,915. While tlie people may not: have been left with as much literature, nevertheless they received something from which to obtain a refreshing drink of God’s life-giving waler of truth,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Them in Your Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the English-speaking friends pass up a large number of placements because they do not carry a good stock of foreign literature along. The director should always see to it that each party going out has the particular kind or kinds of literature the territory requires. In many cases the English-speaking worker cannot even converse with his prospect and, of course, cannot give a witness. But if he had some of the literature in that particular language lie could at least convey some idea of the work we are doing and in many cases leave a number of books and booklets. Therefore know your territory, sec that you have the necessary literature, and go forth as the Lord’s witness unto </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4"> nations. Consult your latest price list and order your stock with your “Special Spring Order”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Tlie new prices which became effective January 1, of 3 books for a dollar, has helped the colporteurs in increasing their number of three-book combinations. During this week the number of three-book combinations surpassed the two-book, whereas prior to the new rates the two-book combinations were far in the lead. It is anticipated that as the friends become more familiar with making up the $1.00 combinations for the consideration of tlie people there will be an increase in the number of bound books placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Taking all in all, it was a glorious week, tuid many have been the letters received from tlie colporteurs telling us how much they enjoyed the special effort which they put forth to sing out the glad song of Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The weather, from the standpoint of witnessing, is excellent, and indications are that it will continue. Marell and April should be used to finish your urban territory. During the cold weather canvassing necessarily had to be restricted to apartments, apartments over stores, and houses with protected vestibules and porches, in large sections of the country. Now the balm of spring is in the air. It is good to be out and to expand after tlie more or less shut-in condition of the winter; just the time to work the remainder of the large towns and cities, those homes not protected with elosed-in porches and vestibules, the outlying districts, the scattered sections, and the hundred and one places you could not work effectively in inclement weather. The way the friends stuck to their posts throughout the entire winter is an evidence of that ‘consuming zeal within their bones’ which win not permit them to keep still. Now much of the weather handicap, sickness and road conditions are being removed, which will undoubtedly result in all the anointed putting in more time. More time means more hours in the Held; more hours means more </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">testimonies;</span><span class="font4"> and, with the Lord’s blessing, more testimonies means a greater witness for the I.ord’s name and a wider distribution of the Kingdom message.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">They are still coming, books und booklets. This time a new booklet culled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven mid Purgatory,</span><span class="font4"> chock full of clear explanations of God's Word. The time has come for the Lord’s people to go forth and give the (rutli io the peoples of the earth. Brother Rutherford has written this splendid til-page booklet in dialogue form. It Is very readable. You will like it, and also its attractive new cover. With eight other booklets it will make a fine-looking combination for 50c. Its subject is one which everybody has discussed sit some Lime or other: going to heaven or some intermediate state. It is another instrument placed in your hands by the Lord and it will have a stinging effect on the Devil and his crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Book Two of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> page 119, we read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“God’s anointed ones on earth are released from Babylon so that they may engage in the campaign of declaring the vengeance of our God that shall lie begun on Babylon at Armageddon. The ‘pouring out of the seventh plague' in the ‘Declaration against Satan and for Jehovah' shows that God's people had at that time been released and were engaged in the enmpaign on Jehovah's side. God’s anointed witnesses on earth must now ‘thrash Babylon’ before her final destruction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophet, Isaiah 41:15, says, “I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth [margin, woutii.s], that shall thresh the mountains and beat them small. Thou shalt make lire hills as chaff.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jeremiah, in chapter 51, verse 33, says, “It is time to thresh her. Yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It is during the ‘pouring out of the seventh plague’ that ‘great Babylon conics into remembrance before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath’. The forces are now inarching to Armageddon, where Babylon’s fall must be complete.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this new booklet, together with the nine books and the other booklets, tiie Lord has provided his people with threshing instruments and commands the remnant to go forth and thresh Babylon with his truth. Yet a little while and then we shall sec tiie Lord do a splendid work of complete destruction of Babylon in Armageddon. While the Lord's people are doing this work they find people who are really famishing, not for bread, nor for water, but for the hearing of the Word of the Lord. &quot;When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, ami their tongue fnileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.” Whom is the Lord going ro charge with the responsibility and privilege of carrying this message of truth to these so as to quench their thirst? The same prophet responds, “Here am I; send me.&quot; The Lord had asked, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” The servant of the Lord is always willing. We hope that every one of the Lord’s anointed will eagerly rend this new booklet, get acquainted with its contents, and then take it forth with the other publications provided by the Lord so that these people may not starve for want of hearing the truth, for there is a famine in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society has mailed to each ecclesia a “Special Spring Order” blank, which we hope will be filled out immediately. Each director and stoekkeeper, when filling out this order, should keep in mind to stock up well, order enough books and booklets of all kinds, especially </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and Purgatory,</span><span class="font4"> so that you will lie supplied up to and including “Watchtower Week” and all of .May. Now is Ihe lime to prepare for the big spring campaign. Have plenty of threshing material on hand, which at the same time, to tiie people of good will, becomes food and drink. Their thirst will be quenched. So then, ye workers, go forth proclaiming the message of trulli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneer colporteurs, auxiliary colporteurs and sharpshooters should also place orders for their stock of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and Purgatory.</span><span class="font4"> We are looking forward to the next few months with great anticipaflon because the Lord’s blessing is resting so richly upon his people in spreading this message of the trulli. Let us go forth one and all with the new booklet in combination with the elothbound books and the booklets, leaving the stinging message of the locusts behind. The Lord of hosts saith, “Work, for I am with you,” and it can be truly said that the remnant are doing just this.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Helpful Hints from Colporteurs</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Tell How They Clean Books, Tally Testimonies, and Trade Books</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Some notes from the field have been received which contain helpful hints for carrying on the work. The colporteurs who offer these have fried them themselves and, having found that they work to their advantage, offer them to you for your consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CLEANING SCUFFED BOOKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One brother writes: “Here is a little wrinkle that yon ought to print in your </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span><span class="font4"> For scuffed books, carry a box of TAN Shinola Shoe Bolish, a small cloth and one larger. Go over scuffed books with small cloth dipped in Shinola, same as you would a shoe, then polish with larger cloth and the books will look better than new. They will be immune from further scuffing, dustfree and waterproof. This is good for books with any cover of cloth, leather or imitation leather. No polish that contains oil will make books dustfree.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TALLY IN G TE S TI .MONIE S</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another pioneer colporteur offers this suggestion: &quot;In reference to keeping track of the testimonies, let us offer a simple suggestion. A couple of pioneer colporteurs presented each of us with a ‘Golfer's Bal’ which is strapped to the wrist like u watch. Each time you press (Continued from page 1, column 1) is the vindication of Jehovah's name. Everything else is secondary to that. They going forth with that thought before their minds, it is impossible to become discouraged. They were God’s witnesses; their objective was to witness, witness, witness, in the most effective manner possible, of course, but the main thing was the witness. And now for the high point of the drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were 217,348 testimonies given by the classes and sharpshooters during this drive. In another part of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> you will rend of the testimonies given by the pioneer mid auxiliary colporteurs. Now stop and consider for a moment the effect of that mighty testimony arising simultaneously from coast to coast and from the Canadian border to the Gulf coast in one week, and then let your vision expand to Canada, Mexico, Central America and South America, and the isles of the sea, and then across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and know that your brethren in these lands are rolling up the mighty total of this witness, the actual number of which probably no human creature will ever know; but the Jjord knows and rejoices, for ho tells us that such children make his heart glad because their zeal and faithfulness provides an answer for those that reproach the Lord. In ecstasy the prophet of the Lord described this day, saying, “Thy watchmen shall lift op the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion.&quot; the stem it registers one, and on up to 100. It is convenient and serviceable.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We presume that these counters can be obtained at almost any store for sporting goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">NEW IDEAS FOR TRADING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In these hard times many of the colporteurs are taking different kinds of produce in exchange for books. The problem arises as to what to take and how to dispose of the surplus above one’s personal needs. A sister offers us tiie benefit of her experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;I should like to offer a suggestion which might be of benefit to other pioneer colporteurs. Through the rural farming sections around here we seldom find any cash among the farmers and people around the edges of small country towns. Many times we can exchange books or booklets for many different kinds of food stuffs: potatoes, pecans, turnips, greens of different kinds, all kinds of fruits and vegetables in glass jars, milk, butter, chickens, eggs, etc., when there would be no chance for a cash placement. We get more than we need for our own table and have had trouble getting much cash out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Heretofore I have always avoided getting rooms in little town hotels because they are not so desirable as housekeeping rooms in a private home, but this time the Lord’s providence prevented our finding such rooms for housekeeping as desired, at any tiring at all reasonable in price. We were forced to go to a little hotel for the night, and found we could make arrangements for them to turn one bedroom into a kitchen with proper furnishings for housekeeping and pay the rent each week in produce from the country we can trade for in exchange for books. This is where they serve meals to those rooming here, and they can make use of much fresh foodstuff, They are also willing to pay us regular retail rates which they would have to pay at the grocery or market. By our buying from the farmers at market buying prices tho difference takes care of any losses formerly incurred iu handling the produce. So now we can feed ourselves and pay rent in produce, leaving whatever cash possible to get for other necessities.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another couple in the pioneer work tell of the arrangement which they made with the grocery men to exchange milk bottles (Southerners call them milk “jars&quot;, this colporteur tells us) for groceries or things they have. “We ask everybody for their bottles and trade hooks,” they write. &quot;One place they hustled up 12.&quot; This suggestion should be a helpful one for those who are working in towns and cities where it is difficult to get tradable articles.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It is marvelous in our eyes to behold bow the Lord has so wonderfully arranged this wilness to be given by means of the radio. These ISJ-mlnute lectures by Brother Butherford, so clear and concise, arc driving home the truth to the peoples of this country and other countries, concerning the message of God's kingdom. Just think of it, at the present time we have 211 radio stations broadcasting these lectures weekly! Not only is this message going forth in this country, but included in this list of 211 stations we have a station in Alaska, one in Havana, Cuba, another in Honolulu, Hawaii, and sixteen stations in Canada, Shortly we hope to be able to tell you how many stations are broadcasting these led ores in Australia, and also how many in France. The Lord has decreed that this message shall be sent forth as a witness to the nations, and this his people are accomplishing, by His grace. Every week there are added to this already large number of stations about four or five additional ones, until now the. list. Ims grown from some fifty slations, which began broadcasting December 7, to 211 stations in March, a period of only three months. At this rate of increase, it appears that we shall have 250 stations on the air by “Watchtower Week”, all hammering away at the Devil’s organization with these marvelous gems of truth. The Watchtower transcription programs have become so much in demand by the people that the managers of some radio stations who originally refused to put on our programs have since signified their desire to have them. Surely there can Jie no doubt in the minds of the Lord’s people that the radio is an instrument provided by the Lord in these last days to send forth his message. His blessing on the efforts of the classes to secure and finance stations is positive proof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An order recently issued by the liadio Commission requires that full-time stations broadcast at least 12 hours each day. A number of full-time stations have not been doing this, particularly on Sundays. This new order may work out advantageously to quite a number of our classes who have been unable thus far to put on the Watchtower programs. Undoubtedly many of these stations, because they must operate 12 hours on Sunday, will be glad to have our programs, and the classes in such places should be aide now to secure a contract at a very low rental rate; or perhaps some stations will be willing to run Hie records free vf cost, in order to fill up the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this country alone there have been distributed 4,006,600 radio folders announcing these lectures. These folders are supplied lo the classes by the Society absolutely at cost, so that the millions of people In fills country may bo informed as to how and when they can receive the message of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The radio is preparing the field wonderfully, as a tetter following on the page reveals. 'Tills is not a rare example, as a good many such letters have been received req nesting Hint someone call on them. Brother Rutherford, in almost every one of his talks, has stated that someone will call. Thus every one of the Lord’s anointed is committed to go from door to door with the literature so that the people may investigate for themselves and find in their own Bibles the statement of truth. We wish wc could quote here inore of the many letters that come in to us from the colporteurs and class workers, telling us how people are very eager to take the literature because they have heard the lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The radio and the field work are as one. The radio message goes forth over the air into the homes. The people hear, and are anxious to learn more. The remnant of the Lord go from door to door with the literature provided by I he Society and this is offered to the people at cost of production and distribution. 'Die people realize that this is a message from God, and when they have heard one or two of these heart-cheering talks they are anxious to receive some of the literature.

<p><span class="font4">The 676,OGG testimonies given in January resulted in leaving 117,032 books and 2.12,206 booklets in the hands of the people. This brings the total of books distributed for the year thus far, including “Midwinter Week”, up to 691,792. During the same period Just year tlie total was 728,418; so we are running a bit behind in book distribution. This is partly accounted for by the many Scripture </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies</span><span class="font4"> which were distributed during the November service week of last year when the special offer was made with the sets of seven. The stress many of the workers are giving to the booklets is also partly responsible, as well as the hard times, which have made it easier to place the booklets. While the booklets are a great witness to the truth, a mere complete presentation of the Kingdom message is given in the bouud books, mid of course the desire of the anointed is to leave us effective a witness as possible. We arc glad to report Unit since tlie new rates of 3 hound books or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lit/iit</span><span class="font4"> mid 4 booklets for $1.00 became effective (January 1) the percentage of books as compared with booklets has increased, anil we feel confident that as the friends become more accustomed to making these special offers tlie percentage of Imoks will continue to increase. Last year leads this by' only 36,626 books. With more class workers and more colporteurs in I he field each week, if special attention is given to the $.1.00 combinations, tills tend should not be difiicult to overcome, by the Lord’s grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When tlie booklet distribution is compared witli that of lust year, wc stand in amazement. The total for J anuary a mounted to 252,206, which, together with the &quot;Midwinter Week” figures, brings tlie grand total for the year thus far up to 1,511,844, us compared with lust year’s total of 666,411 for the same period. That, means that there has been an increase of 845,433 booklets. What a testimony this Is of the zeal and determination of the Lord’s anointed to do tlie work which the Lord has commanded them to do I Wil li such a substantial lead in booklets, time and attention cmi bo given to the $1.00 combinations without fear of running behind in booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This tremendous increase in booklets brings the grand total of literature distributed away above last year's total for the same period. Compare 2,203,636 with 1.394,829, which are the respective totals, and then praise the Lord for the privilege of having a little part in proclaiming the good news of his kingdom which will ultimately result in the vindication of his name.</span></p>

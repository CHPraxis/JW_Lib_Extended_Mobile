<p><span class="font2">And now for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font2"> report of what you have been doing during I lie first, quarter of the year. While the majority of I be people have been holding back and industries have been curtailing production because of the hard times, saying, “Business is bad,” “It can't be done,” etc,, the Lord's anointed have refused to allow the Devil to discourage them. When and where conditions are bad they have worked just so much liarder in order to leave the witness in the hands of the people. And they havc done it., too, as the figures show. Just look them over anil see for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the year</span><span class="font2"> opening with ‘Testimony Week', we had a good start for making 1931 bigger and better than ever. Of course the &quot;Scripture Studies Week” dining November, 11)29, helped to offset the big lead obtained al. the outset; but a comparison so far of the two years shows I tint the past three months exceed the same three of last year in total literature distributed by 621,150. While there were more bound volumes placed last year than this, the total being 54S.245, as compared with 512,734, Ilie booklet distribution of tills year so far exceeds tlm! of last llml. ibis shortage is more than made up. Think of it I 1,115,945 booklets as compared with 459,3341 The Kingdom is here. The Lord has arranged for this Kingdom gospel l.o lie preached, and has made provision by reducing the price on the bound books, for a wider circulation. It is anticipated that the attrucrive new offer of 8 bound books lor $1,&lt;IO will enable the friends to leave more of the bound books in the hands of the people from noir on and to quickly overcome the small shortage in books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is no use inliiiniizing the fact that this big increase in total literature distributed Is because of tin<sup>1</sup> Lord’s time for the message to go to whosoever will hear, and the appreciation of the Kingdom privileges, which cause the friends to work harder than they did last year. I That, we believe, is very pleasing to the Lord. Jusiend of -115,&lt;181 hours ! being spun I in the work, there was a total of 720.599 hours roiKjrteil. This means that during the three mouths just </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">past</span><span class="font2"> there were, on the average, 5.203 class workers and sharpshooters witnessing 4.64 hours each week, G8t&gt; auxiliary colporteurs witnessing 10.55 hours weekly, and 1,062 pioneers witnessing 20.85 hours weekly. This shows conclusively that those who really love the Lord are endeavoring to use their time and ! strength to the honor of bis name. |</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">luHtend of an average total of 5,022 class workers and colporteurs in the field weekly, there has been an average of 6,951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As is to be expected, I he literature has been left in the hands of more people because of this increased activity. There were 614,643 recipients of l.lie Kingdom message in printed form, as compared with 441,892 dur-, tug the same period last year. Besides these, many more were given a testimony at their door. The report of testimonies being somewhat i inaccurate, on account of 1.110 late notice given and also of the fact that some of the friends have overlooked recording them on their reports, it lui s been necessary to estimate the number for those who have failed to report them. While the average number of testimonies per hour comes to less than four, the final</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">results are indeed encouraging. This estimated figure, which we believe is conservative, comes to 2,027,040. This means that the quarter-mark towards the quota of 10,000,000 has been passed during the first quarter of the year. Can we do ft again during the next quarter? We hope that ail the friends from now on will .keep u careful check on their testimonies and will be sure to report them weekly so that we need not lose any in reaching and, if possible, surpassing that 10,000,000 mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This quarterly report, showing more workers (both colporteurs and class workers), more hours in preaching the Kingdom gospel, more people left with the message in “printed form, and more testimonies given, is indeed one to make glad the heart of all those who love the Lord and his kingdom.</span></p>

With clarion tones the Bible Itself answers, in the vision given to John In the Isle of I’atmos, where we read : “And I saw an angel standing in the sun [the light of the glory of God that shines upon the temple] ; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly In the midst of heaven, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Come ami gather yourselves</span><span class="font2"> together unto the supper of the great God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is the battle cry mustering God’s remnant on earth that they may take their assigned position before the battle is fought. The supper of the great God is a supper of Jehovah’s preparation for Ills remnant. It comprises the flesh of kings, captains, mighty men, and of horses and of those that sit on them, thus describing the Devil’s organization as it is arrayed for action against God’s people. To participate in this feast means that the anointed are witnesses of God’s open judgment forcibly executed on the Devil’s organization in the vindication of bis word and his name. This is meat and drink to the anointed, and by faith those who are really of the Lord’s anointed have entered Into</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During most of 1930 the remnant measurably entered into this feast by faith, but with the advent of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> (Books 1 and 2) this supper which the Ijord prepared assumes a depth of understanding, reality and appreciation never before conceived of by the remnant. Now that the contents of these books have been assimilated by the ‘eagles’, they can appreciate as never before the significance of the prophet's words, when he says, “Thus saith the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God, Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yow selves,</span><span class="font2"> and come; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gather yourselves on every side to my sanrifice</span><span class="font2"> that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood, . . . Thus ye shall be filled nt my table with horses and chariots, with mighty* men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord God. And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To the anointed this is as though it had already taken place. God has promised it, ami will bring it to pass. They are therefore absolutely sure of I heir position. <sup>r</sup>rhat being true, each one wants to get himself into this feast. This means actively participating in doing the work that the Lord 1ms provided for Iris people to do at this time, Throughout the world the anointed will assemble at this feast in a very particular way during the midwinter drive week, January 31 to Fcbrnary 8. That, however, does not mean that they are going to cease from feasting when this drive is over. There was a time in the past when the I,ord’s people believed Hint when the winter, with its inclement weather and innumerable difficulties from cold mid bad roads, set in, they should cease activity in the Kingdom work until the early summer, when conditions would brighten up again; but now it is seen that obstacles in the way of Kingdom service are simply things to come in magnifying the Jehovah. The hindrances snow and sleet are things</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">be overname of of rain, that can</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">lie .overcome hy intelligent planning and a determination that nothing shall stop the Kingdom work and the witness that the Lord requires his people to give at the present time. Therefore, after February 8 each service director should see that his territory is carefully checked over and such territory set apart for the remainder of the winter as can be worked to the best advantage during inclement weather. Apartment houses, apartments Over si ores, homes where there are vestibules— all these provide protection to the worker and to the prospect and can , : be canvassed effectively in nil kinds of weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ The combination used generally t.lirougliout the country should be the bound books ; the three for $1.00 in nil sections where business depression exists. This, however, does not mean that the worker is to limit himself to three specific books; but rather, he is to take all the books, ami explain them all 1) his canvass, and then call attentio-. to the different offers: $2.90 foi^ me set; $I.W tor any six vi linf first seven ; $1.00 for any three of tiie first seven, or for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> (Books 1 and 2) with four booklets. The success of winter canvassing depends to a very great extent upon the careful planning of the service committee hiuI the coojieration of the workers. In many respects this is the “add test&quot; of a capable service committee ; for there is very little difficulty encountered in working during the summer, when weather conditions, and everything else, are at their</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">best. Therefore this matter should</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Lie approached with prayerful consideration and an intelligent endeavor to work the most accessible sections of each assignment during the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I'lan your time. Thursday, Saturday afternoons anil Sundays arc the special days for group canvassing. In the winter weather the individual worker requires more encouragement because of the added difficulties that must be overcome. Therefore a special effort should be made liy all the workers to attend some or all of these drives, not only for hn ir sake, but also for the encouragement and help they may be to others who probably have greater difficulties to contend with. “That which every joint supplieth” is essential to tiie well-being of the entire body. It behooves each one of us, therefore, to consider carefully how we arc fulfilling our obligations in tliis respect. Our slogan should Ito: THURSDAY. SATURDAY AND SUNDAY IN THE FIELD. Mark your calendar early. Choose the group you will meet with on each day, and plan your work so that you will be there on time, determined to use your faculties to the Lord’s glory and the encouragement and help of the brethren,</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Folders Cheaper </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">j Back Calls Successful</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I It is very Interesting to us to see | how the friends are taking hold of piie distribution of the radio folders, ■'ince we began printing these we 'lave had orders exceeding two million. Enclosed with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font2">there is a copy of the new folder for the director and for each of the .colporteurs. This new design will, w hope, be even more effective than .he last one. You will note that jiiitc* a few questions arc printed on tills one, and it can be used Instead of the old question slips we used to print. We have just completed another printing of two million of these folders. Due to the fact I । hat we print them In such large quantities. the following new prices will go into effect on February 1; $1.00 for 1,000; $2.50 for 3,000; $4.00 for 5,000; $7.50 for 10,000.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">These prices cover the exact cost of paper and printing and the carrying charges. The pioneer colporteurs hiave had a special rate for some time, and tins still applies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When the office here receives let-iers from interested listeners to the radio programs, workers’ slips are made out and nisiled to Ilie class director or to the colporteur in the territory in which the listeners live, and hack calls are made. We believe there is no better means of 'placing books than by making Ihese hack culls, a few examples:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I called and placed the six liookg he did not have: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beeane-ilintlon, Government. l-lfr, I’ropheey</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ <sup>1</sup> , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;■ if .</span><span class="font2"> ... 5 ,i i i,.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Colporteur Offers Suggestion to Southern</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Colporteurs</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following letter from a colporteur who has had considerable experience in working Southern territory effectively, and who has been able to place a lot of literature In the bands of the people, indicates the Import mice of studying each situation to sec liow it cun best be handled. Many well-meaning colporteurs go out into a. territory without giving It real thoughtful con-sideratlom This letter from a colporteur offers wine excellent suggestions which would be well for others to follow. The letter reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Greetings from tiie field!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Am writing at this time to express a few thoughts that have been gathered from time to time in the work. I have noticed that some colporteurs who were really earnest and putting In full time in the work have failed to make n go of it in the South, due to the luck of knowledge of certain things that would mean their success in placing the books in the hands of the people. Many colporteurs do not know the full value of trading for marketable produce or do not know how to market tiie produce. For instance, hens in one locality are 12c a pound and by shipping to the nearest poultry dealer the same hens would net 18c. Hence the people could be allowed 18c and a much greater inunlier of hooks could be placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Colporteurs coming from the North to work Southern territory sometimes do not realize that they must change their canvass to suit rhe class of people they are dealing with, and therefore fail to accomplish as much as they otherwise could by adapting themselves to the conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Another mistake is made in the manner of working the territory. Some jump from one place to another in the county, worldtig a little here and there, which many times causes prejudice to spread over the unworked portion of tiie county and greatly lessens the possibility of placing the books, whereas if the territory were worked systematically from one side to the other a much more effective witness could be given. The towns should be worked last, as n rule; for there’s where tho preachers are, and many times Satan works through them to warn their “prisoners” of the fact of a messenger’s coming to their door, and thus keeps them from getting the message in permanent fortn.” post office town has been assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No one should work any territory not properly assigned, even though it be just across the county line and in the rurals served from a post office town within the class or colporteur assignment:. In other words ; keep within the county assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To properly report the year's work for the county, a record should be kept of the work done In each post office, town or city separately. However, the work done in the rural sections or in small towns Umi are not post office imiiits should be reported under this one heading: “Rural Work.” It will not be necessary to report to this office the rural work done under each post, office town. The one item will Buffice.</span></p>

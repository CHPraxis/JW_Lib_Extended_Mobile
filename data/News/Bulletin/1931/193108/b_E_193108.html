<p><span class="font4">The period designated Witness Week was set apart and this title was chosen for it during the latter part of 1930. This was before the new name “Jehovah’s witnesses” was considered and before arrangements for the Columbus convention had been undertaken, All of these points are very significant to the Lord’s anointed at the present time when they see the appropriateness of the title Witness Week for the first active campaign after the public adoption of the new name by the Lord’s anointed. It gives us positive assurance that the Lord had in mind the detailed events that were going to take place at Columbus and immediately following long before his people on earth saw or appreciated it. This assurance must thrill the hearts of the anointed, knowing that the Lord says, “Unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it.&quot; The converse of this must bo that when we have positive proof from the Lord that he is directing oven the minutest details and we are in harmony therewith our efforts must be fruitful to I he Lord's glory and pleasing to him. What a happy prospect for Jehovah’s witnesses as they enter into this Witness Week campaign 1 The name is most appropriate to inaugurate the first campaign after the adoption of the new name, and surely it is most appropriate to start the world-wide campaign with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet containing the resolution adopted at Columbus declaring that the Lord’s kingdom is the only hope for mankind and placing the issue squarely before the leaders and people that the time has come for them to render allegiance to Jehovah or bo entirely destroyed as opponents of the Lord and his organization. This is surely the Lord’s doing, and marvelous in our eyes. Those who were privileged to attend the Columbus convention saw much evidence of how the public in general accepted and fell in line with the great truths the Lord was revealing at that time. An Illustration of this was manifest at the time the new name was announced. Stores, restaurants and business places In general which were decorated with signs, “Welcome I.B.S.A.,” “Welcome Bible Students,” etc., in many cases were changed to “Welcome J.W.&quot; or “Welcome Jehovah’s witnesses” within a few hours after the announcement was made, and by Monday morning a very large percentage of these signs had already’ been changed. This in itself is proof that the Lord has manifested to his people that the time is ripe for them to publicly take their stand as his witnesses and make this manifest to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the Witness Week campaign from September 4 to 13 Inclusive, the new booklet, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World,</span><span class="font4"> at 5 cents, will be the main presentation. Every effort should be made to place this booklet in the hands of the people as quickly and as effectively as possible. The way the booklet went out at Columbus and the auxiliary conventions leads us to believe that the distribution of this booklet will exceed anything that has taken place to date. There wore between 300,000 and 400,000 of these booklets dis-</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Service Leaders to Work with Classes if Requested</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The Bethel family are going to have six days to jmt in the Witness Week drive with the rest of the friends. In order to have sufficient literature ready for the drive Brother Rutherford has arranged for both a day and a night shift to work in the factory in making these booklets, The Society hopes by that time to have more than 2,000,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklets printed and ready for the witness. Ail the brethren are imbued with the importance of seeing that this message is given speedily; consequently, as soon as the campaign starts on Friday morning, September 4, arrangements are made to close the factory, office and home so that the enilre family can have part in tbe drive for the four days Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In accordance with the usual custom, the service leaders will be sent to classes who desire brethren to lead them in the field service during the period September 4 to 7 inclusive. Sometimes after the drive we receive no (ice from different classes stating that they wished they had had a service leader but</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">With Gladness We Accept It</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has been pleased to give the anointed a view of the confidential relationship that exists between biinself and his witnesses. He has been pleased to confer upon this class a new name, regarding which he says when speaking of the enemy, “All ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen, for the Lord God shall slay thee and call his servant by another name.” The Scriptures tell us that the mouth of &gt;&nbsp;Jehovah himself shall name this new name by which the Lord Is going to call his servants. This name is referred to in the Scriptures in the following terms: “Ye are my witnesses that I am Jehovah,” or, Jehovah’s witnesses. Surely this manifestation of Jehovah’s love and consideration for his people is the most strengthening thing that the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Lords people could possibly receive at the present time. This signal honor is conferred upon the Lord’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> servants because with them Jehovah refrained from requesting one because they believed tlial: some other class needed him more. We do not believe that this is the proper attitude to take. Each class feeling that they will have a reasonable number of workers in the field during the drive and desiring to have a service leader serve them during that period should make their request. If there are sufficient brethren to supply all the classes, then all will be served. If not, and their class happens to be one that cannot lie served, then they can accept It as the Lord's will that they continue and push the service alone. But to determine beforehand that it is not the Lord’s will that they have a leader for that drive seems to be making up the Lord's mind for him instead of letting him overrule according to his will, and therefore each class that can have a reasonable number of workers in the field during Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday should make tho request immediately. Classes within a distance of 300 miles from Brooklyn will be served during these four days. In addition to the four days above mentioned, the factory and office will be closed also Saturday, Sepis supreme. The glory of his name and his word is the most vital thing In their existence. The conventioners at Columbus, Ohio, unanimously adopted this name, going on record that the Lord’s servants on earth shall be publicly known henceforth as Jehovah's witnesses. It would therefore be proper for every local ecelesia cooperating with the Society in the Kingdom work to arrange immediately to carry on their local activities under this name. All the workers in the field should represent themselves as Jehovah's witnesses. All other names, such as Bible Students, International Bible Students, I.B.S.A., etc., should be immediately discarded. When the Lord confers the title upon his people, not only is it fitting to accept that title, but it is wholly improper to disregard it or be indifferent toward accepting it. Therefore, let all those who are really the Lord’s make the name “Jehovah’s witnesses&quot; their name from this (ime forward, both collectively and individually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tember 12, enabling the brethren to serve the classes on Saturday and Sunday, September 12 and 13. Classes tlial. cannot be served during the first part of the drive will he served during the latter part. Please make your requests immediately, so that arrangements for sending out these brethren may be completed as soon as possible and the classes notified. The object in having these brethren serve classes during this period is that they may lead the friends in the field activities. These brethren will not serve public meetings, but will be prepared to give a class talk or conduct a service testimony meeting each day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">THE MESSENGER</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Never before have we received so many subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> newspaper. Before we went to Columbus, Ohio, we had more sub-i scriplions for this convention report than we had at any previous time. Due to this fact the Society decided to print a few more of each issue, knowing that after the convention was over the demand for this would continue. The complete set of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font4"> five issues, can still be had for 35c in stamps, or three sets j to one address for one dollar.

The financial condition amongst the people is very bad. If or this reason many may be hindered or even prevented from having something to read concerning the Kingdom. We must do our part to help them, and look to the Lord to provide the ways and menus. Our heavenly Father has, by and through Christ our Lord and King, graciously made provision that we may produce the bound books containing (lie message of the Kingdom nt less cost than when we first began to print them.

<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>The Fight Is On and We Are on the Lord’s Side</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The August 15 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Toner</span><span class="font4"> shows us the responsibility resting upon the witnesses of Jehovah to give Jehovah’s warning to Christendom. This responsibility cannot be avoided. Concerning this, Jehovah says: “When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou glvest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wleked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. ¥et If thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from Ids wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.”—Ezek. 3: 18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time has come to give this warning. The Lord has provided his people with literature to use for this very work. The question then is as to how to do the work most effectively. The plan of procedure follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ikfter Witness Week, during the remaining weeks in September, every clergyman, preacher, or leader of a religious organization of any kind is to be called upon and canvassed for the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope</span><span class="font4"> of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Iha World-. </span><span class="font4">If they will not pay for the booklet one should be given to them free, for this warning must be given to them by God’s witnesses. Jehovah made them “a watchman unto the house of Israel”. “Therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me,” he says to his people. Having joyfully-taken the new name of “Jehovah’s witnesses&quot;, the remnant class has a great responsibility resting upon them to faithfully live up to this name and to sound the warning to those who claim to represent God and yet who represent the Devil by being the leaders of his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Service directors and those who are holding individual territory assignments should begin at once to plan to call on every preacher in their assignment following the Witness Week. Look up the addresses of the various preachers in your territory, so that when the time comes to call upon them you will know just where to go and will bo able to make the calls in the least time. The calls should lie made personally, and the booklet itersonul-ly presented to the preachers, giving them the opportunity of paying for it if they will, and if not, of taking it anyway. When calling upon them let them know that this message is lieing delivered into the hands </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font4">all the preachers throughout the world and that it Is of great importance to them to read it that they too might Ite informed. In presenting the booklet to them be kind and courteous, but bold and fearless in your stand for the Lord and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now for a few suggestions as to ' how to get the names and addresses of the preachers. In the larger I cities, where classified telephone di- j rectories are published, one will find them listed under such headings as &quot;Clergymen”, “Christian Science must be given, and all those who really love the Lord will delight in having a part therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Remember, the report is not to be sent to rhe classes and colporteurs until with the September </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font4"> and when it is returned at the end of the month it is to show the entire number of booklets placed during the month </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in the hands of the rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Fear God,” not man, no matter how powerful in the affairs of this world he may be, “and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.”—Rev. 11:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Start now to make arrangements for doing this work, and when Witness Week has ended let the friends go forth joyfully and sound this warning to all the rulers of Christendom.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">Practitioners.” “Missions,” “Church Organizations,” etc. In other towns and villages, the names of the preachers can be obtained from the local newspapers. If the addresses are not given, they can be looked up in the telephone directory. This will be a good opportunity for some of the friends to do some service in the evenings in order to get everything arranged to carry on the work following Witness Week, so that it will be completed by October 1. A special report card will be mailed with the September </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> to all directors, colporteurs, and sharpshooters, on which to report the entire amount of work done among the preachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In making these special calls, the heads of religious organizations, such as secretaries of the Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A., Salvation Army captains and preachers, the heads of parochial schools, convents, monas-Icries, church boards, Bible Societies, etc., should also be included. This warning must be given to the rulers as well as to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the special stress of this campaign is to Ire laid upon getting booklets into the hands of every clergyman, the financiers, politicians and military rulers should not be overlooked. The special report card which wilt be sent out will have a column in which to report the. number of placements made with clergymen, politicians, financiers and military officers. Under &quot;Politicians” report the booklets left with congressmen, of both national and State legislatures, governors (together with other high state officials i, the chief municipal officers, judges, and the heads of government offices. The idea is not to include the petty officials, but the leading men who would rightly be considered as the rulers of the people. Under “Financiers”, report booklets placed iu the hands of only the executives of million-dollar corporal ions and with people known to be of the millionaire class. Army officers of the rank of colonel or higher, and navy officers with the rank of captain or higher, should be reported under “Military Officers”. Those of lesser rank should not be included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This information will give a good IdofL as to bow thoroughly the ruling class is receiving this warning which must be served upon them. Already the president of the United States has been called upon. In your efforts to obtain an interview with these prominent men, mention of this might be made with good effect, together with tine statement that this message is of such great importance, particularly to men of prominence and influence, that a personal call is being made upon the leading citizens of America, Great Britain and other countries. By adding, “That is my reason for desiring to sec Mr.--, so that. I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">can personally deliver to him his copy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be a big job to reach these men, but we know that the time 1ms i come for the warning to be given fol all. In doing this work, remember that you are one of Jehovah's witnesses ami have no cause for fear or lor being ashamed. This message</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">(Continued from page 1. column 2) tributed during the live days from Wednesday, July 29, to Sunday, August 2, in those ten cities. What will be the distribution by all of Jehovah's witnesses in this country for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ten</span><span class="font4"> days, September 4 to 13? Time will tell. The fact that the booklet Itself is the most beautiful and attractive booklet (hat we have ever presented for so small an amount; the facts that the message it contains is the most vitally important message ever deliverer! to the people; that the public have manifested an eagerness to get this booklet such as never before witnessed; that its message has been given and advertised over the greatest combination of radio stations ever banded together for one program ; and the further- fact that the people of the Lord have been fired with such a zeal, due to the vision they received at Columbus and the message contained in the Uhidicn-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tton</span><span class="font4"> book, that they are practically irresistible in their enthusiasm in presenting the Kingdom message, make us believe that we would not be greatly exaggerating if we were to say that we expect the results to be close to one million for the ten-day drive. Boiled down to cold facts, that will mean approximately 10,000 workers in the field, placing 100 copies each. That means 10 copies a day for each one of the ten days. This can be done. It is not an impossible task, by any means, ami undoubtedly a great many will place more than this number. We have the lord’s assurance that we can do all things through Christ who strengthenet.h us. Therefore, as his witnesses, let us go forth in faith placing this message in the hands of the people. The general plan of action during the campaign is to work all the large cities and towns in your territory first. Concentrate on the homes during the daytime; and for the evenings we suggest a plan that was very successful In Columbus and at some of the auxiliary conventions, that is. to place your workers down town at the busy intersections, having one worker on each corner, and place the booklets directly with I he people. Other local arrangements can be taken advantage of according to the existing conditions in lite different towns and cities. Some work can be done in subway cars, entrances to subway stations, or other prominent places around railway stations, where people are coming or going all the lime. A worker can dispose of a large number by working these places continually. In doing this work it should always be kept in mind that you arc the Lord’s witnesses ; consequently yon should be courteous, considerate in the presentation of the message and in offering it to the people. Discourtesy and rudeness do not react either to the Lord's glory or to the effectiveness of the work that the Lord's witnesses are doing at the present time, and much trouble ttrid misunderstanding has been caused because some tactless brother or sister thinks it is his or her duty to force or hammer the truth on people when they don’t want It. We are simply the Lord’s witnesses to present his message to those who desire to hear it. With those who don’t, the Lord will deal in his own way. The importance of doing this work speedily and effectively cannot be overstated now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In another part of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font4">you will be advised of a special campaign among Ilie clergy which will follow the Witness Week. While Witness Week, September 4 to 13, is to be the special drive with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet, this does not mean that the campaign with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet Is going to end with Witness Week; this campaign is to be pushed during the entire month of September, Work fust and try to cover all you can of your assignment during the month. Those classes where auxiliary conventions were held and who have I he </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet, and classes that have some of the booklets which they took from the Columbus con ven lion, may start immediately in the distribution of this booklet and work during all of August and September, centralizing, of course, particularly on the special drive week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you have a supply of the new booklets on hand, you Should get busy with them at once. If not, you can get a supply soon, as consignments are being made to the classes. Class, sharpshooter and auxiliary rates will all be the same, or 4e each. The pioneer rate will be the same as on the ten-cent booklets. No time should be lost in getting this booklet into the hands of the people. Make haste so that during August and September as much territory as possible can be covered with Ilie </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom-</span><span class="font4"> booklet.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Colporteurs Please Take Note</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the colporteurs have been sending in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions for friends they meet in the work, asking that they be entered on the “Lord's Boor” list. This should not be done. If anyone wishes to obtain the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font4"> under this arrangement, he should apply personally direct, to the Society. If dime through a colporteur, such subscriptions will not be entered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since colporteurs are. granted spe-| clal rates on subscriptions, they are requested to accompany their sub-! scriplions with remittance figured :i.t the special rates, if they wish to I nilminnIe extra bookkeeping. By sending in the full rate it makes a credit memo necessary In order to give the colporteur the benefit of the allowance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Onward marches God's glorious truth as ids true and faithful witnesses actively engage in proclaiming the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For tlie first nine months of this fiscal year the grand total of literature placed amounts to 4,277,911 books and booklets, to compare with 3,630,692 for the same period last year. This is truly remarkable and is a cause for great rejoicing on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses. These figures are in themselves an explanation of why Jehovah has given his people this new name. It is because of their doing the work which he has commanded them to do to the honor of his name. They rejoice in bending every effort to increase their kingdom interests that his name might be glorified. As a further proof of this an examination of the nine months’ report shows that there has been a more determined effort on the part of the Lord’s people to be actively engaged in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Please note that the number of class workers lias increased to an average of 4,812 and 215 sharpshooters working weekly from a total of 4,148 class workers and sharpshooters. The number of active auxiliaries has increased from a monthly average of 499 to 700, and the pioneers from 894 to 1,102. This makes a total of 1,288 more workers in the field weekly than during the same period last year. These have put in the time, too; and as a result a grand total of 8,445,455 testimonies have been given to the honor of Jehovah’s name, and literature has been left in the hands of 1,856,437 people, which is 229,105 more than last year’s first nine months. Wc arc getting right along toward the testimony quota of 10,900,000 for the year. With three months more to go, with only a little over 1J million testimonies to make, and a new booklet to spur us on, we ought to go over the top by working hard.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The one rat her disappointing thing about the report Is the fact that there has been a decrease in bound-book placements. Last year at this time a total of 1,580,526 books had been distributed, to compare with the 1,439,437 of this year. Tills, of course, is largely due to the financial condition of the country, and the fact that the friends have laid more stress on the booklet combinations than they have on the books. That they have been doing this is proven by the big increase in number of booklets placed. Last year’s figure . was 2,050,166, whereas this year’s figure is 2,838,474, an increase of 788,308. The activities with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font4">booklets during the next two months will send this figure soaring away above last year’s, but it is anticipated that the inauguration of the new prices on books on October 1, of 4 books for $1.00, will result in next year’s figure’s more than making up the book shortage In this year’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a joyful task Jehovah’s witnesses have at this time I ’They are absolutely sure that they arc in the right; for they are fighting on the Lord's side, with only one purpose and alm in life, and that is, to show forth his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What will be the figures for the next three months? Well, that depends on how active you are in preaching the Kingdom gospel.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">AVc are forwarding in a few days a stock Inventory form and an order slip. The object of the stock Inventory form Is to get the inventory of each class on October 1. This inventory will be used as a basis for allowing credit to classes desiring to be credited witli the difference between tlie old prices and the new prices which go into effect October 1. Classes that desire to share some of the burden of the expense incurred in the reduction, by not taking the credit, may authorize their service director to sign the Inventory slip, as the class’ representative, stating to the Society that the class wishes to bear this amount. The order blank is primarily for the purpose of ordering </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> for the drive. This will be released in time for the November drive. Each class should he stocked up with a large supply of this book. Also, they should stock up well with all the other books and booklets that they need to cany them through the full and winter campaign. Remember, the new prices on clothbound books go into effect on October 1 ; so order a good supply. At 4 for $1.00 on the English and 3 for $1.00 on tlie foreign you'll need a lot of them. Send your order in as soon as possible. We will fill them sometime just before October 1, 1931.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>What Is a Service Convention ?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">From time to time wc receive advice in the office that a num tier of local conventions, which are termed “service conventions”, are not really service conventions at all, as far as witnessing to the name and purposes of Jehovah from house to house are concerned, because most of the time Is spent in the halls by a number of brethren in discoursing and theorizing and a number of others spend a great deal of time and energy in preparing elaborate meats and serving them to the convent!oners. After these two forms of service are done the majority of those attending the convention have very little time or strength left for house-to-house service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wc recommend that In all cases service conventions devote the entire forenoon and a portion of the afternoon in the house-to-house witnessing and that not more than two talks lie given on any one day. In almost any good-sized town meals can be obtained at a very reasonable price in nearby restaurants. Besides a number of friends bring their lunch along with them. It is unwise to waste time and strength in such work as preparing and serving food for the assembled friends, when that time can be used for magnifying tlie name of Jehovah and bestowing real blessings upon tiie people. Obtaining meals In these restaurants would mean only n few cents to each one and would be considerable in the magnitude of the witness that could be given to the Lord’s purpose.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Reports for the Special Drive</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">In accordance with the usual custom a special report is required from the classes for this week. Therefore each director will see that the report for the week preceding the campaign closes Thursday night, September 3, and Ilie drive week report commences with Friday morning, September 4 and continues up to and including Sunday, September 13. Colporteurs will arrange to make a similar report covering the drive week. Sharpshooters are being forwarded a special report card with instructions covering the drive week activities.</span></p>

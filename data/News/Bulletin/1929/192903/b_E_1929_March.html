<p><span class="font4">month of January and also for the four mouths ending January 31, 1929. A close analysis of these figures reveals a number of interesting facts which will, we trust, be helpful to the service committees and the workers in planning their work for the remainder of the year. In considering the figures for January, the fact that She first twenty days of the month were devoted to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font4"> drive makes that the most outstanding event of the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ANALYSIS OF JANUARY ACTIVITIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Iii the February </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> we called attention to the fact that, due to the epidemic of influenza, we hardly expected that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font4"> drive would come up to the quota set for this period. We are free to admit, however, that we &lt;li&lt;l not expect that the decrease in the drive would come anywhere near the disappointing figures shown on the table above. Our quota for the drive was approximately one million booklets. Our sales for the period were 199,509, or about 800,000 short of what we expected. When we advised you in the January </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font4">that the March </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> would carry the results of the drive, we did not expect that our report would be so poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, facts are facts, and no army can hope to be victorious if it is afraid to face the facts as they exist. The pertinent question that these figures bring up is, Why did we come so fur short in the peoples </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Friend</span><span class="font4"> drive in January? The first cause undoubtedly was the effect of the flu over a large portion of the United States, which retarded the activity of the workers in many of the classes. The second contributing cause was the intensely cold weather that existed in sections of the country where the weather is usually mild at this season of the year. The southwestern states, which usually have an ideal climate for our work during the winter months, bad their worst winter in years, snow, sleet and ice tying up traffic and paralyziug business in general in some sections. The North and the Northwest were also tied up with similar conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CLASSES’ RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IN SLUMP</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While these facts undoubtedly played the major part in retarding our sales, there were other causes which resulted in so small a sale of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font4"> booklet, and these are found amongst the classes and the workers themselves. During the October and November drive the average sales per hour per worker were 17 booklets. During the January drive the average was five booklets per hour, which seems to suggest that the real force of the message was not appreciated by the friends to the same extent as when </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">booklet first came </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">out and that</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">same ‘punch’ into their canva. for the booklet and It did not over' so well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CLASSES NOT REPORTING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another reason is that praetlcMr one-third of all the organized claBs In the country have not sent InW’-ports for the month of January, “e received reports from only 610 mjt of the 910 organized classes. TIffire does not seem to be any real reason why this condition should exist, for regardless of how bad the weather Is, a postcard can be dropped* in the mailbox. Even if a class has been unable to do any work during the week, a report should be mailed to this office. Otherwise it is Impossible for us to properly plan the work and cooperate with you in disposing of your stock and magnify the name of Jehovah. Therefore we again request that each service director do his part by seeing that a report card Is forwarded every week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONTINUE WITH </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">PEOPLES FRIEND</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From this time forward, every combination of books sold should include a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples FrM </span><span class="font4">and this booklet should be ofTtgxi i,u every home where none</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">other literature can be placed, so that this message will get into the hands of the people as quickly ns possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">DELIVERANCE</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> AND </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">RECONCILIATION</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> SALES WEAK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Considering the figures for tbe four months just ended, it will be noted that we arc particularly weak In the distribution of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation.</span><span class="font4"> These are 12,000 and 10,000 short of ttie peak that Got?-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">emment</span><span class="font4"> has reached. Therefore an effort should be made to tighten up on the canvasses for these books. Examine your presentation at your workers’ meeting. Discuss the proposition, and see if this difficulty can not be overcome so as to bring </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font4"> up to the same level as the other books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As an Indication of how tlie public appreciates </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font4"> we have before us a copy of a catalog issued by a book-publishiug house wherein they quote &quot;Deliverance, by Judge Rutherford—$1.40”. Of course this is entirely unauthorized by us, but it does illustrate tbe public’s idea of the value of our books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ANALYSIS OF FOUR MONTHS’ ACTIVITIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total sales of bound books for the period of four months amouuted to 17.5 percent of our quota, while 33J percent of our time has already expired. In other words, we have sold only oue-sixth of our quota for the year In one-third of the time, and with our booklet figures we are still farther behind. We have disposed of ouly one-ninth of our quota lu one-third of the time. Sale of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend </span><span class="font4">has not reached fifty percent of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">number sent to the classes, which</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Pioneers Asked to Report on Completed Territory</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">Pioneer colporteurs who hold territory assignments of counties that they have completed are asked to enter the number and kinds of books sold in each of the places worked, and the date of completion, on the assignment sheet and return it to us. If any have gone over their territory once and wish to recanvass it before going to some other place, write us to this effect when sending in the assignment sheet, and we shall be glad to re-a.sslgn it. to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">constituted the quota; and all the time set apart for the special drives with this booklet is past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This indicates the necessity for careful planning on the part of the service committee and the workers in the field in order to overcome this handicap. While it is true that the foregoing figures are for the four worst months of the year and Include the time when the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend </span><span class="font4">campaign was under way, nevertheless it is going to take careful planning, persistent work and a maximum amount of time in the service in order to overcome the handicap that we are faced with now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A further analysis of the figures shows that during the first four months of the year only 25 percent of the quota of time has been put in, instead of 33J percent to keep up with the portion of the year that has expired. The calls made have amounted to only twenty percent of the calls that should be made during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The average number of workers per week wa.s set at 4,000. Durlug the first two months we went well over the 4,000 mark each week; but the drop In the last two months brought the average number of workers in the field each week down to 3,668, or 91.7 percent. The number of classes reporting is far short of tlie total number. Evidently a number of classes do not appreciate how necessary their reports are in order to intelligently prosecute the campaign that the Lord’s people have before them at the present time. The number of classes reporting in January was GIO. The average number reporting for the four months ending January 31. was 692, out of 910 classes. Evidently twenty-five percent of the classes do not appreciate their responsibilities in tins connection and have not reported once during the first four months of this fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These figures are uot presented for the purpose of discouraging or disheartening the friends. We are still convinced that our quota will be more thau reached before the end of the year; but, rather, these figures are presented that every one might realize what we are faced with and understand the amount of work necessary in order to come up to the goal that we have set for ourselves. In all probability, if the number of classes who have not reported had reported regularly there would be a better showing than indicated in tlie table above.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Special Combination For This Week</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">As announced in the February 1 H’ateJi </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tower,</span><span class="font4"> the first IB SA Week fur .1.929 takes pla.ee Muy 19 to 26. Each service committee and worker should commence planning for this event right now. The drives should lie arranged to cover tlie larger towns in your assignment that have not been worked during the winter months. The towns which you intend to canvass during that week should be chosen as soon us possible and captains appointed to look after tlie witness in each town. These captains should arrange to get well acquainted with the territory In advance. Figure out how many workers each captain will fh * quire and how the workers can be * most advantageously distributed to avoid duplication of work and waiting around for books and territory. Also, the means for transporting the friends to these different towns should bo considered, and whether interurban trolley, bus or train is to be used. Competent guides with a thorough knowledge of tiie territory should be appointed for euch party, and depots for additional supplies arranged for in convenient locations which would be known to all the workers in that town. These can usually be arranged for In small stores. Of course, if automobiles are used, they will constitute the depots for the literature and should be conveniently parked so as to be accessible to the workers. In this way many of the retarding influences and conditions that would hold up the work and waste considerable time may be largely eliminated before the drive commences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MOST ATTRACTIVE COMBINATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tlie particular combination to be used during May IBSA ’Weak-wili—J be the five books. The Society has arranged to ship to each class whose reports indicate that they are disposing of these combinations in their lerritory u limited supply for IBS A Week. These combinations are being enclosed in a very attractive </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Flash-tone</span><span class="font4"> container which can be used to display the literature in a prominent place in the home, such ns on a library table. This can also be placed in the bookcase, thus keeping the combination always intact. We believe that this container will add very materially to the attractiveness of the combination aud be a big help In selling the entire combination at one time. People will rarely request that a combination packed in sucti a container be broken. We believe that the advantage derived from this method of presenting the books will be a big help in placing eutire sets in the homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">booklet quota reached, and one-third of the year passed! That looks bad, doesn’t it? But we are not discouraged; for when you see the two new booklets, we feel sure that you'll be anxious tn put them out Just think, two new booklets, covers iu four colors, really Interesting reading, the best yet, and to be sold for only ICkJ apiece! Are they pretty on the outside as well as wonderful on the inside? You just wait and see. They ought to sell like hot cakes. In fact, we are wondering if that 1,600,000 booklet quota is going to be high enough.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>MAY 19 TO 26 IBSA WEEK</span></h1>
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Biggest Witness in History of the Church</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">All Kindreds and Tongues to Engage in World-Wide Message</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first IBSA Week of this year is set for May 19 to 26. It should be viewed as a spring drive of the Lord’s army on the enemy’s camp. From November to April tbe Inclement weather and short days retarded the activities of the Lord’s people, or at least limited their activity to their home city and a few of the larger towns tn their assignment. The winter season always bas a more or less depressing effect upon the public whom we have to canvass. When they open the door cold winds pierce them and, due to the fact that the workers may have either snow or mud on their shoes, the people often do not feel like inviting them In. Consequently we are handicapped during that period. However, spring Is now here, with its sunshine, and the people are in a more responsive mood. Every one seems to be enjoying life. This season brings hope and cheer; an awakening to life is in evidence everywhere. The Lord seems to be tuning the world for the Kingdom message. Every anointed servant of the Lord should be Imbued with the spirit of the season, much more bo than any one in the world could hope to be, due to tbe fact that not only have we the sure evidences of spring, but behind it all we can clearly see the great awakening which It symbolises and the great God, our Father, who arranged it all. In this way the Lord is going before his people, preparing the way for them. The Lord also assures us that in this day of judgment he will cause the wrath of men to praise him. Never has this been brought home to us more forcefully than in considering plans for IBSA Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PENTECOST</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first point that stands out In this connection Is the manner in which the Lord overrules the agencies of Satan to his own glory. In their efforts to confuse the people regarding Jehovah God and his purposes and to relegate his name to the background, Satan and his representatives have set Easter Sunday this year to take place on the 31st of Mardi. Pentecost, which is 50 days later, will therefore, according to their reckoning, fall on May 20. Throughout Europe and in South America Pentecost is extensively observed. May 10 and 20 are set apart this year as holidays during which most of the people are relieved from their secular employment. The Lord’s remnant in those countries where Pentecost Is so observed, appreciating their privilege of magnifying the name of Jehovah, will undoubtedly be glad to take advantage </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">um</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> arrangement </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> the adversary </span><span class="font5">and stage a counter-attack during these two days particularly, which are the first two days of IBSA Week, and also the remainder of the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If concerted action Is taken by the friends throughout the world, undoubtedly the witness will make itself felt from one end of Satan’s organization to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">VICTORIA DAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tlie second occasion whereon the Devil and his associates are going to find themselves confronted with the Lord’s army pushing the battle to the gate will be on May 24, which also comes within IBSA Week. May 24 is observed throughout the British Empire as Victoria Day. The British Empire is the world-power of our day, and therefore represents the visible phase of the Devil’s organization. What could be more appropriate than that the Lord should arrange that our spring drive should open with a direct attack upon the enemy’s main stronghold. Without doubt the majority of the friends throughout the British Isles, Canada and Australia will be released from secular employment from Friday, May 24, until Monday, May 27. These days will be set apart as a &quot;week-end holiday”, few firms caring to upset the week-end by openlug for a few hours on Saturday morning. What a wonderful climax this affords for IBSA Week in the British Empire! We are convinced that this possibility has not escaped the notice of the friends In these (Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER Network Aids Canvassers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Many Books Sold Because of Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The April 15 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> carries a notice of a nation-wide network broadcast to be given by Brother Rutherford on Sunday, April 21. During this broadcast and the remainder of that Sunday every available worker should be in the field canvassing with the books, particularly in districts where radio stations in the watchtoweb network come in clear and strong. There Is no greater joy or more thrilling feature of the service work than that of calling upon those who have their radios tuned In and are listening to the message coming over these hook-ups. We are here appending a few testimonies which were recently gathered at a convention where the workers were out In the field during the watchtoweb network program. We might say that these testimonies were from one of the most difficult sections of the United States to canvass with the truth literature. These are only </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fl few of many meh testlmonlffl</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A Special Week for Colporteurs</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Flash-tone Cartons</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Not to Be Used Before May 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The flash-tone cartons for the five-book combinations are not to be used before IBSA Week, since they have been obtained as a special feature of the drive. In view of this, colporteurs are requested not to order them before April 15. We do not fill orders for cartons alone, but only when the combinations of the five books, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Deliverance, Creation, Reconciliation </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font5"> are ordered packed in these special cartons. An additional 5c is then added to the price of the combination, t»th to colporteurs and to classes, for this attractive box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These cartons have been obtained as an experiment. If they aid tn tho placing of more complete combinations, more will be obtained. Please remember that they are not to be used before the beginning of the big drive on May 19.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>DON’T FORGET</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Many classes have not filled out and returned the Inventory sheets covering their stock. This is materially retarding onr plans for helping the classes dispose of their surplus stock. Therefore, If yon have not forwarded your Inventory, kindly arrange to do so as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">that we are receiving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother K. canvassed two University of Maryland college boys on the &quot;campus” during the watchtoweb hour. They Invited </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> down to their Fraternity House, where about thirty-five boys were present Brother K. asked them if they wanted to hear something good. Then he turned on their radio to the watchtoweb program. After the Drama he sold them all the books he had (86) and made arrangements to have a meeting with them the next Thursday evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another brother in the party met some more watchtoweb radio enthusiasts and sold all the books he had—fifteen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One brother, coming to the porch of a house, heard Brother S. announcing the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font5"> book after the Drama. He knocked and held up his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font5"> saying, &quot;Here is your book.” The party took </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Creation </span><span class="font5">also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another brother called on a house after the watchtoweb program and canvassed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">They wanted everything he had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Forty Hours in Eight Days to Be the Average for Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Heretofore no special record has been kept of the activities of the regular colporteurs during IBSA Week. But in view of the fact that all the anointed throughout the earth are going to be putting forth a special effort at that time, we thought that you too would like to do the same and to know the results of your activities. Consequently we are making arrangements to tabulate the results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now here’s the plan. Since IBSA Week Is to be from May 10 to 26, including two Sundays, we ask that you make out your report for that week to include the entire eight-day period instead of the usual sevenday week. This will mean that your report for the previous week will be for only six days. Then send us your Report Card Sunday night, May 26, before you go to bed. The auxiliary colporteurs are asked to do the same, as we are going to keep a special record for them too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CLASSES VS. COLPORTEURS?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The classes are entering tbis campaign with a determination to equal the colporteurs. Since the auxiliary colporteurs' sales are included in the class reports also, the regulars will have to put forth a real effort if they don’t want to be left behind, judging from the results of last year’s May IBSA Week. But, when you consider what has been done by an average of between 700 and 800 colporteurs working weekly and averaging only a little over 17 hours a week and what could be accomplished if all of the 1062 who are now enrolled were to average 40 hours during this 8-day period, you can see that there really Is a good possibility of your being shoulder to shoulder with the classes when the final results are tabulated. Then, besides, new recruits are Joining the colporteur ranks daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Remember, also, the consecrated throughout the entire earth are going to be working with you, singing forth the praises of our God. They are going to be putting forth a more strenuous effort than ever. What a great shout it will be!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wbat will he the final report from the battle front at the conclusion of this great attack? We are looking for a big advance in the front line sector held by the colporteurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">? Saturday ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sunday has proven to be a very excellent time for canvassing and so wo are inclined to forget that a few years ago much of our work was accomplished on Saturday afternoons. We wonder how many could get into the service Saturday after</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">noon as well as Sunday, Let us try It.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Many Joining the</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Increased Enrollment</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Stresses Importance of Canvassing Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thoroughly</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It makes us very happy to see the way in which the friends have been responding to the call for more colporteurs. Each mall Is bringing in more and more applications and requests for information on how to become a pioneer or an auxiliary. Since the mailing of &quot;The Time is at Hand&quot;, February 23, 329 applications have been sent out and 105 new colporteurs have been enrolled. Surely the time Is at hand for the greatest witness yet to be'given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the colporteur list increases, it becomes doubly important for those who have a territory assigned to them to endeavor to work it thoroughly. In times past some have just skimmed over their assignments, taking a few of the more important towns and leaving the rurals and out-of-tbe-way places untouched. They have made frequent requests for additional territory, sending tn uncompleted assignments. When. only a few colporteurs were in the held, such territory would not be reassigned the same year; but now it means that when the territory is turned over to some one else to complete, the cream has been taken and the one following has to bear the burden. Surely those in the remote sections are as well entitled to receive the message as those in towns and on the main thoroughfares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course, during cert ain seasons of the year it is extremely difficult to work the rural sections on account of mud and bad roads. We do not expect the impossible, but bring this to your attention in the hope that those who have not been attempting to cover their assignments will put forth an effort to do so. Some write us that they can’t</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Continued from page 1, column 2) </span><span class="font5">countries and that they are now busily engaged in making their arrangements. The name “Victoria” means “to conquer” or “I conquer”. “The sword of the Lord and of his anointed,” is the battle-cry of his people. Let all the anointed throughout the earth then make this a real victory day; and not only a victory day, but a victory week. It is written, ‘Lind they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by Hie </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of their</span><span class="font5"> testimony.” Surely recognizing the time we are in and the manner In which the Lord goes before his people, preparing the way, and the wonderful opportunity to use the forcmentioned provisions of Satan io God’s own glory in advancing the Kingdom message, will inspire every one of the Lord’s anointed to get behind a mighty witness during the May IBSA Week,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the foregoing, there are throughout the earth local and national holidays of which the friends in different countries will undoubtedly be glad to avail themselves, such as Independence Day in Armenia, which takes place on May 28, and the holiday of the great Constantine and Helene, in Greece, which is observed on May 21. These days have been used to defame the name of our God and to confuse the people respecting his purposes. Now his people who really appreciate the issue of magnifying his name in the earth will be glad to take advantage of the op-portunlties these holidays afford to do thia and to lift up a standard for the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Colporteur Ranks </span><span class="font5">get Into the rurals because of having no automobile. At the same time a frail colporteur sister, whose report was given in the October 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font5"> wrote us how thoroughly and satisfactorily she was able to cover such territory afoot, using the parcel post to keep her supplied with books. She has found this to be so successful that she has come to prefer It to using an automobile. Other colporteurs who can not afford to operate an automobile have worked their rural territory and outlying towns by means of a bicycle. Their reports as to this means of travel have been very favorable and encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Recently the following letter was received from a colporteur in Idaho: &quot;I was feeling a bit discouraged because the roads were still blocked with snow. Even the highways have been closed part of the time on account of snow-drifts. I was thinking that I would have to wait till the roads got good in the spring before I could again work rural territory. But rain, enow, bad roads, cold, or even the Devil, can not hold the Lord’s army back ; so I thought, ‘Why should I be a slacker?' I know that Is what the Devil would like to see: slackers in the Lord’s army. So, after I had finished the town territory, I started out afoot and canvassed about four miles out in the country and then canvassed back on another road, and did the same thing today, and came In happy in the Lord. The farmers about all ask a fellow in on n cold day, and one has a chance to warm and rest while showing the books. Although the houses are quite far apart, so that I could not make nearly as many calls us in town, I sold more bound books in the two days than I had sold lu two successive days in town for some time. So I say to myself, ‘Why sit down and wait for the roads to get good enough to ride around in a car?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EVENING CANVASSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It) the United States we have no holiday within the period covered by Muy IB SA Week, However, in this country we have many advantages not enjoyed in European countries. As a rule, hours of secular employment are shorter. A big majority of the friends who are working are through work about five o’clock in the afternoon. Many of them will be glad to take a little lunch on at least two or three days during the week and devote the period from five to nine o’clock to evening canvassing. Many of the friends in the larger cities take their lunch with them and devote their noon-hour to canvassing business sections and offices, which can be done to on advantage at that time. There are two Sundays and one Saturday afternoon in IBSA Week which can be devoted entirely to service by practically all the friends. In addition to the foregoing, many of the friends may be able to make arrangements with their employers to have the whole week, or nt least one or more days, off from their usual work and devoto it to the service. We are convinced that the importance of the occasion would justify the friends in getting some time off from their secular employment for this purpose. To cooperate in this Ilie director should make a careful canvass of all workers in his class who can get away from their avocation either all or a part of the week. Ascertain when they can got this time off, and provide territory for them in which to work. Our recommendation is that hi this country all the friends arrange, as</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>A COURT DECISION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">There la still a measure of timidity manifest among certain of the friends because of bombastic efforts made by some overzealous but ill-advised officers of the law. For the encouragement of such we append here the decision of the county court of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, where a brother was arrested for canvassing for our literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">IN THE COUNTY COURT of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ALLEGHENY COUNTY, PA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Commonwealth of Pennsylvania vs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) No. 97 of 1029.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mike George</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Judge Snee in disposing of this case, after hearing thereon, entered an oral judgment that the summary conviction be sot aside and the fine and costs remitted to defendant. The Court bases this decision on the fact that defendant was not engaged in “business&quot; at tbe time of his arrest, considering &quot;business” as being anything engaged in for profit or personal gain. He further said that he felt tha Council of the City of Duquesne in framing this ordinance did not contemplate it would embrace workers of an organization tsueb as the International Bible Students Association while engaged in a work of charity from which the worker derived no personal pecuniary profit.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>IBSA Week Report</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">A special report card is being prepared for IBSA Week and will be mailed you with the May </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span><span class="font5"> Thia eard covers the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">eight</span><span class="font5"> days of IBSA Week and Is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in addition </span><span class="font5">to your regular weekly report. Do not confuse it with your weekly report. Remember this is In addition to that. Forward your weekly report as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We again ask the delinquent directors to either forward a report of the class activities every week or write us why they ore unable to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">far as possible, to take off May 24 aud Saturday morning, May 25, and join with the friends in the British Empire, who will have a holiday on these dates, and, of course, the following Sunday, in staging a mighty world-wide climax to our IBSA Week, While it is true that the British Empire Is the mighty worldpower through which the Devil to a great extent controls the affairs of the earth, It Is also time that the financial wing of his organization is definitely entrenched lu this country and through It he is oppressing the people throughout the world. Unison of action, part icularly in the British Empire and the United States, should mark our attack during this period. Therefore, if it can be arranged for the friends in this country to set apart, at least these three days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, May 24 to 26, with the friends in the British Empire having n holiday during this period, we believe that the world-wide witness will have a very telling effect upon the Devil’s organization everywhere. The presentation of an uncompromising 'witness to the name of Jehovah will comfort many who are mourning because of the oppression of the adversary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We should appreciate a brief report from each director In the United States before April 15, stating how many of the friends In their respective classes will be able to set apart these three days for all-day service, so that this information maybe given in the May </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font5"> If the foregoing arrangement can be adopted also by the friends in other countries throughout the earth, It</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The $1.00 Bible</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Depots Stocked to Meet Demand</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the colporteurs are becoming quite enthusiastic about offering the 51.00 Bible with the combination of 5 cloth books, saying that it aids them considerably in placing more books. At 82.08 the offer has a big appeal to the public. Of course the Bibles should not be sold separately; for unless the reader has the key to open the divine plan, he is left without the witness. Because of the many who are now using these Bibles in their canvassing, it lias been found advisable to stock up the depots at Chicago, St. Louis and Oakland. Colporteurs may now send their orders for them either to this office or to one of the first two named depots. They will not be in stock at Oakland until about May 1.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>A “PEOPLES FRIEND” WITH EVERY SALE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Of tlie 5,000,000 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font5"> which have been printed, there is still a considerable stock left. This booklet contains a message which should be placed in the hands of the people as quickly ns possible. If all work together in this and endeavor to leave at least one of these booklets at every home, including it in every sale that is made, the stock will be rapidly disposed of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The classes and colporteurs reported 153,171 different people as having purchased some of our literature during tbe month of February. If a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font5"> booklet had been included in every sale, the number distributed would have been almost a half more than were actually placed. Tlie total of these booklets sold was only 105,559,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">win, of course, be so much the better uud will result in an unprecedented witness given during IBSA Week and will also give us a real start for our summer campaign. The service department at Brooklyn would appreciate hearing from the different branches regarding their plans for tills drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOOKS AND 10c BOOKLETS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The colporteurs, to date, have made more than double the sales o£ bound books made by the classes durlug the same period; and In the booklet sales they are 34 percent ahead of the classes. However, the classes have disposed of over a million and a half </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font5"> in addition to their other sales, while the colporteurs have disposed of approximately 300,000. The distribution of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font5"> booklet has of necessity retarded tlie sale of the bound books and the ten-cent booklets In the classes during the past few mouths; but we are expecting that a comparison of April’s figures will witness a decided reduction of the difference that exists between the col iwr tours and the class workers in their sale of bound books aud of booklets. We are hoping that IBSA Week will see the classes exceed tlie colporteurs in their sales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the new flash-tone carton for displaying the combinations, and with the two most attractive booklets ever put out by the Society just shipped to the classes on consignment, wc believe that they have the accessary ammunition to put them over the top without any difficulty, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">It can be done.</span><span class="font5"> We are looking forward to the July </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font5"> wherein we will let you know to what extent you have gained your objective.</span></p>

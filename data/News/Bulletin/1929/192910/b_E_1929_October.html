<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">To Be an International Campaign “Should I Sell Scripture Studies?”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Greatest Offer Ever Presented to the People</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Every Class Making Special Arrangements</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As stated In the October 1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font5"> the Society has set aside the week beginning Sunday, November 10, and ending Sunday, November 17, inclusive, as a special week for the sale of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures. The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> has repeatedly emphasized that the fundamental doctrines, as outlined In the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font5"> have never been changed. Those fundamental doctrines are just as essential now as they were twenty-live years ago. Past experience has evidenced that the Lord himself provided the food contained in these volumes for the nourishment and blessing of his people. The charge that the Society is opposed to placing these books In the hands of the people can not be substantiated by any statement appearing In any of the Society’s publications. On the contrary, it is the purpose of the Society to stage an international campaign using the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> exclusively. Tills drive will include the United States, Canada, England, Germany, Greece, Toland. the Scandinavian countries, and others. The peoples of those European countries dwelling in the United States are also to be witnessed to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this campaign it is hoped that eaeli one of God’s anointed will have a part. Brother Rutherford has arranged to adjust the factory schedule so that tbe Bethel family may have some time to participate in this special effort. This drive will constitute the fall campaign for this year, instead of the live-cent booklet usually distributed. The entire set of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies </span><span class="font5">will be offered to the public at $1.25. This is the greatest offer of its kind ever presented to the people; a library on the Scriptures that cuts its way through the false doctrines of the Devil's organization just as thoroughly and as effectively now ns it did ut any time during the past forty years. Every one who lias some of the later books by Judge Rutherford and is interested in their message will he anxious to obtain the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures, </span><span class="font5">which the Lord used to lead and feed his people during the time when lie was preparing Ihe way. There are millions of people iu the world today who have heard Judge Rutherford over the radio. Other millions have read his iiteratur-e and are Interested in it. A good proportion of these will be anxious to get a set of the books that first interested him and started him studying these precious truths of God’s Word from the standpoint of Ihe Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely no one wall contend that the Lord will not use the message contained in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> to the blessing of these people, when we have such abundant evidence of their benefit to God's people in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore let each one enthusiastically get behind the campaign and push it to the glory of the Lord from one end of the earth to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CAMPAIGN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a big field for the distribution of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies</span><span class="font5"> tn </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> in the territory covered by the watciitowkk chain network in the United States and territory which has been recently covered with the Inter books, written by Judge Rutherford, both in tills country and in Europe. If the canvass suggested in another part of this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font5"> is used, which connects up our present work with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies tn the scriptures</span><span class="font5"> and shows their relationship to that work and to the momentous events that are transpiring in the earth, a large number of these </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies</span><span class="font5"> can be placed in the hands of the people during the eight days set apart for this special work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore let the service director in each class set apart the thickly </span><span class="font4">(Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font7">ANNOUNCEMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Attention, all ye auxiliary colporteurs, service directors and class workers! An important change in the auxiliary colporteur work and requirements goes into effect October 1, which we hope will make it possible for many more to enter this branch of the work and for those to conliriue who are already enrolled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From that time forward the requirements will be a minimum average of twelve hours' canvassing a week, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ineludinff</span><span class="font5"> Sunday, instead of ten hours’ canvassing a week, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">exclusive of</span><span class="font5"> Sunday. In other words, it means that if </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">worker is able to work six hours or so on Sunday, and the balance of the twelve hours' time during the remainder of the week, lie can enjoy the special rates and privileges of the auxiliary work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Instead of reporting their weekly sales to the service director as well as to us, from now on the auxiliaries will be asked to report weekly to Ibis office only. As heretofore, they will receive their assignment of territory from the class service director, provided they are working with a class. ’They will keep a careful record of all books sold in the assignment; and when the assignment has been completed, it will be returned to the service director, together with a complete report of the sales. From now’ on, therefore, no colporteur sales will be included in the weekly report of class activities sent in by the service director. The director will keep a record of books sold in the territory, for his yearly report of the total work done in the class assignment. If a quota is set by the class, the work done by colporteurs working with it may also be taken into consideration in attaining this goal hut should not be confused with the weekly reports of the books sold by class workers only, sent in by the director. Henceforth, service directors should not include in their weekly report sales made by any colporteurs, regardless of their rating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We believe that this arrangement will greatly aid in simplifying Ilie work. Knowing just what the class workers in each class (exclusive of the colporteurs) are doing, the service department can more accurately judge the size of the consignments which should be sent to the respective classes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Make It Short</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and Cover Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following is a suggested canvass for placing the sets of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies</span><span class="font5"> in the homes of the people, You recall that for the last few years we have had five-cent booklets and that these were placed in the hands of the people very rapidly, due to the fact that we urn tie a short, snappy canvass and did not spend much time telling the people all about the booklet. We believe that this same method can be used with this set of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies,</span><span class="font5"> because we are offering to the people such a line set of volumes, seven of them, for only $1.25. It should not lake much talking to distribute these among the people during this special drive week. We might say;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Good morning. I represent Judge Rutherford, the international radio lecturer, who broadcasts over </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">great chain of stations every Sunday morning. Many people have wondered liow he first became interested in Bible study. It is this very set of volumes I have here which he read, which led him to the (Continued on </span><span class="font4">page 2, column 3)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Many Reasons Why You Should</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A Witness to Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several letters have been received from zealous and conscientious friends who desire to carry on the Lord’s work in the Lord’s way, asking this question: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;In view </span><span class="font5">of the increased light which the Lord </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font5">given his people now, should one of the Lord’s anointed sell </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">sets of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps you have had the same question in your own mind. Therefore we are going to give you our view of the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Beyond any question of doubt, the Lord’s blessings have been upon the publication and distribution of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> In times past. They have been used by him during the harvest period to enlighten his people concerning his divine purposes. Many of those who are in present truth today first eiime to know and love the Lord through their reading of these books. They still contain the ten great fundamental doctrines of the Bible, which, even with all the increased light on the fulfilment of prophecies, have not been changed. Nor is there any likelihood of their being changed, for the increased light but further proves their correctness. The fact that today we see more clearly the fulfilment of certain prophecies is in exact accord with the Bible statement that ‘the path of the just shines brighter and brighter unto the perfect day’. Should one then hesitate to sell these books, because certain prophecies are not so clearly explained? No; for the books themselves serve as an additional proof of Hie rapidly increasing light and should </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">fur</span><span class="font5">ther aid one, if he reads them together with the later books, to see that he is on the rigid track in his search for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who is there that lias been in the right heart condition that has not received much comfort and consolation as he has read these hooks? They have brought this comfort because of tlie great fundamental truths which they contain about God's purposes. Paul, in 2 Corinthians 1: 4, allows why Jehovah has given this comfort, saying, “that we may be able to comfort them which arc in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves arc comforted of God.” Having received this comfort, then, through reading these books, why should there be any reluctance In offering them to others?</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers Expected to Have Big </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Part in Set Drive</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A Real Experime</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nt for Back Calls</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Place Orders Soon for the “Studies”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneers, what are you going to do in tlie world-wide one-week campaign with the sets of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies?</span><span class="font5"> Of course you want to have a part in it. The zeal and enthusiasm with which you have entered into the two other special drive week’s during the past year lias convinced us of this. And in order that you can have a real pud. in it, we are anxious to do our part. We know that it would be difficult for you to meet your expenses unless a Special price were made to you in order that you could ulToni to offer the set for $125. Therefore the Society has arranged to bear this burden and offer them to you considerably below their actual cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We believe that at the special half-price rate at which these sets arc to be offered to the public you will be able to place more books than ever before. What do you think you can do? Here are a few figures to think about. During May LBSA Week, which corresponds with this special week in November in length of lime, you averaged 4,85 five-book combinations, 2.20 two-book, .05 three-book and .23 four-book combinations, or a total of 7.43 sales of combinations per colporteur. Some, of course, did much better than this, whereas others did not do so well. Besides this, many single book's were sold. Now if eight days are given to offering the seven books at this half-price figure of $1.25, we should not be surprised to see you average about twelve set-sales each. This will mean, of course, that some would have to sell more than this, in order to make up for those who on account of sickness may be unable to he out full time in the work. Twelve sets may sound like a lot, to some; but after all, it is not quite two sales a day for the eight-day period. Results show that if one (Ctniliiuied from page 1, column </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2) </span><span class="font5">populated sections of his territory which are covered by the chain hook-up, and, if not In the chain area, territory manifesting the greatest interest and where the largest number of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance, Creation, Reconciliation</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font5"> have been placed during recent years. This territory should be districted for the drive. The minimum number of culls set apart for each worker should be about fifty. This inakes an ideal assignment for one week’s special work and should be covered by one worker without any great difficulty. Out of the fifty homes set apart, a conservative estimate of sales would he four. Therefore the average for the week should be approximately four sets of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scrip-ht-rcs</span><span class="font5"> per worker. During this drive the canvass for the. sets should be short and to the point, and where there is no interest shown the worker should hurry on io the next home without wasting any time in talking about the other literature. This is to he a drive exclusively for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">4,309 WORKERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year 1929 there was an average of 4,309 workers in the field each week. We believe that there will be more workers out during this special drive on the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies. </span><span class="font5">However, using the conservative figures of 4,309 workers, each calltalks booklets, he sells only booklets ; if he talks books, lie sells books. Therefore, docs it not seem reasonable that If he talks sets of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies</span><span class="font5"> at half price, he will be able to sell them too? And surely it is the desire of all those who love the Lord to place in the hands of the people the great truths which he has given them In the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No doubt you have some good territory which you have gone over with the latest books and which you would like to recanvass with these sets during this week. Give those who have obtained the latest books the opportunity of this wonderful bargain. Many were not at home when you made your first canvass of the territory<sup>7</sup>, while others were </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">too </span><span class="font5">poor to buy. Here’s an opportunity to xuake soiue good back calls. Why not let them also have the opportunity of obtaining the message before you leave for another territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Send in your orders to the depots or to this office. We shall appreciate It if you order In lots of multiples of seven sets, if possible, since seven seta will nicely fill one carton, fourteen sets two cartons, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Remember, the drive is for the one week only. Begin making your plans and preparations now. If you have a stock of sets on hand, then will be the time to place them in the bands of the people. If you send us a statement of these we shall be glad to credit your account with the difference between the usual pioneer price and this new one, so that you will not have to bear the loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As heretofore, the report for this week will be for the entire </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">eipht </span><span class="font5">days, instead of the usual </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">seven-; </span><span class="font5">which will mean that the week previous will be for only </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sigs,</span><span class="font5"> ending Saturday, November 9, instead of Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ing upon fifty homes and selling on an average of four sets during the week, it will mean that at the end of the week we have canvassed over 200,000 people and placed over 17,-000 sets of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures, </span><span class="font5">What will the results show?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely the fact that the Lord has prepared the message in this way and placed it in tire hands of his servants is proof conclusive that it is bis intention that they should, as his 1x111108808, place it in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another feature that should be taken advantage of at this time is calling upon the large number of people who have shown marked interest during recent years and who have been specially followed up by one particular worker. These people, in practically all cases, will have Ilie later books, written by Brother Rutherford, but not the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures.</span><span class="font5"> Each worker who lias been instrumental in follow-up work among those people and in developing their interest up to the present should make It a point to call upon them and offer them a set of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font5"> to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">complete</span><span class="font5"> their library of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Evenings, when the whole family is at home, or at least those of the family wfio are most interested in the truth, is the ideal time to carry on tills phase of the work. The director should make special plans, setting aside these names for the different workers, and strive to as-1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">During Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother Rutherford has set aside three days of this campaign, so that the members of the Bethel family may have n greater part in the distribution of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies. </span><span class="font5">This will mean that approximately ISO brethren will be spending three days full time In canvassing from door to door, giving the witness of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">lids will also permit some of these brethren to serve classes from eastern Ohio to the Atlantic coast, and as far south as Norfolk and Richmond, Va. There will not be enough brethren, of course, to serve all the classes, and preference will therefore be given to those classes making early application. Classes desiring a brother from Bethel Lu serve with them and assist them during this special campaign arc requested to have their application in before October 21. These brethren will lead the friends iu the field, and will also be prepared to give some lectures in the evenings. They can arrange to leave New York Thursday evening and bo ready to go out with the friends Friday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past two drives of this year the Bethel family placed a considerable number of books and received many blessings in so doing. Their big job is making “better and more books”; but when a drive is on they are nil glad to take advantage of these blessings.</span></p>

This he has been doing, and many people have been encouraged by his lectures and also his own publications. Why is it that 15,600,000 copies of these books which you see right here have already been sold? It Is because they contain such a message of hope and comfort. They give you a clearer understanding from the Bible itself of God’s great purpose, not that man should live on the earth in sickness and sorrow, but that he should enjoy perfect life and happiness. Furthermore, they show that mankind will receive these blessings through his kingdom, which is near at hand. You want to know about such a kingdom, don’t you? In Order that you might, for this week only, we are offering this set of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> for half its usual price.

In fact, the people living outside of the drive territory should be given preferred attention; for those who are within the area which is being covered will in all probability he canvassed anyway.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The auxiliary colporteurs are to have an active part in the campaign with the seis during the eight days, November 10-17. The rate granted to them will be the same as that extended to the classes; i.c., 91c for the entire set of seven volumes. As a mailer of convenience, then, if you are an auxiliary colporteur working wiUi a class, you can obtain your stock direct from the class stockkeeper instead of ordering a separate stock from the Society. If you are not with a class, you may order direct; for, of course, you will want to have a part in this work. Regardless of whether the books are obtained from the class or from the Society direct, remember the new arrangement, as announced in another part of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font5"> calls for a report of your sales to Ilie Society only. It is no longer necessary to report weekly to the director, hut only when you complete a territory.</span></p>

As of old. 1he Lord went before his people, putting their enemies in confusion ami preparing Ills witnesses to accomplish the good pleasure of his will. In order to appreciate the magnitude of the work that the Lord is now doing, we must realize that the Devil, through his organization, controls all the resources of the world and is bent upon the destruction of God’s faithful witnesses, ami that, if it were not for the protection of the Lord, none of them would last twenty-four hours. Yet, despite all this assembled opposition, it. has pleased the Lord to use his little band of ■witnesses to give the greatest testimony of all time to the glory of his name and the establishment of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The figures for the week speak for themselves. However, a brief comparison of the outstanding features of the week's drive with some events of the past will be found very encouraging. The number of workers in the field during this IBSA Week were 1,580 more tliun were out during the May drive. The number of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font5"> sold was more than the combined total of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font5"> sold during the IBSA Weeks in which they were released. In the number of bound books sold there was an Increase of 12,646 over that of May of this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Undoubtedly the radio chain hookup did much to prepare the people for the new book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font5"> and also to stimulate the workers to a keener appreciation of their privilege in distributing It. The increase in the bound-book sales brings forcibly to our attention one outstanding fact, and that is that the people in general will take what is properly presented to them. They do not know what is best for them, consequently they arc unable to determine what they should buy. The Lord, however, knows what, they need most, and from time to time places his message in the hands of his servants to carry to the poor groaning creation. It therefore becomes the privilege and duty of the Lord’s people, realizing that the Lord has provided them with the message, to present this to the people. In the past we were prone to let the people determine what they should take, and usually they took booklets rather than bound books because they were cheaper, The determining factor was not that which the Lord provided for their best interests, but their own preference, which was usually selfish. Therefore, in order to properly represent the Lord and do his work at the present time, the servants of the Lord should watch his guidance carefully, realizing thul: he has provided them with the different niessages that he wishes carried to the people, and stress that message as being for the best interests of the people at that particular time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The bound books contain the message in its most permanent form and will undoubtedly lie retained and reread long after the booklets have been destroyed. Therefore it is for the best interests of the people to induce them to buy the bound books. This, of course, does not mean that the booklets do not have their part to play in God’s witnessing work now. There tire many people who are so situated that it is impossible for them to spend more than the few cents required for the booklet. There are others who are more or less skeptical and can not at the present time be induced to invest in more than a booklet in order to investigate the subject, while there are still others who are so selfish and so eager for this world's goods that they would not be willing to spend more than a few cents even to obtain the knowledge of God’s kingdom. Therefore booklets are ail that can be placed in the hands of these people, and every effort should be made to leave one or more with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">WHAT </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">LIFE</span><span class="font4"> DID</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During IBSA Week the Lord provided a new book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font5"> By means of the radio hook-up, particularly, the Lord gave his people a vision of its importance and of their responsibility toward its distribution. Enthused with this vision they went ont and enthusiastically offered </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life </span><span class="font5">io the people, and the people took it because it was presented with enthusiasm. Undoubtedly a great number of these people would have been satisfied to get a ten-cent booklet, hud they been offered that, but the Lord's people, realizing the importance of the new book, and stressing it:, imbued the people with their enthusiasm, so that the people themselves realized their need of this book. Therefore it seems evident that the Lord's people, having the mind of the Lord, arc in a belter position to determine what the people now need to help them understand tlie Lord's purposes than are the people themselves, and should do everything possible to leave with the people that which will do them the greatest good, and this will undoubtedly be found in the bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">COMBI NATIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are one or two points in our IBSA Week activity, however, that might be improved upon. We mention these here, not with any idea of cri I seizing the work done, but rather that we might profit by our experience and use these weak points as stepping-stones for greater success in the future. There was a decided drop in the number of combinations placed. During August IBSA Week we left only 6,010, as compared with 8,200 during May IBSA Week; a drop of 2,100, mostly in five-book combinations. This was due, undoubtedly, to the fact that the friends became so enthused about the new book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font5"> that they forgot to stress the combination of the six books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Conditions are generally better in August than in May, and with the same amount of emphasis placed upon the combinations, we should have sold a larger number than were placed during May IBSA Week. It would be well to keep this point in mind in the future. The sales per worker and the hours per worker show a decided decrease also. This can probably be attributed to the 1,580 new workers who entered into the service during August; they, being inexperienced, were unable to make as many sales as those who were longer in the work. This resulted, of course, in reducing the average for all workers. The same reason would account for the drop in hours per worker. Apparently most of the new workers did not devote the same number of hours that those did who arc regularly in the field; consequently it meant a reduction in the average number of hours per worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">MORAL: Be regular in the service, mid therefore more capable of glorifying the Lord and receiving richer blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Continued from page 1, column 4) </span><span class="font5">l-’iirtlicrmpre, the fact that the Lord's blessings have so unmistakably been upon the publication and circulation of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies,</span><span class="font5"> and the fact that he has had these printed tmd placed in the hands of his people to be carried to others, constitute them a real kingdom interest. What is to be done with this kingdom interest which the I .ord has given to his people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Millions of people are suffering from misery, hardship, aches, pains and distress, due to the oppressive organization of the Devil. The market, is flooded with literature which contains no trulli whatsoever. It is rend by the people but gives them no hope, and they know nol which way to turn. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies</span><span class="font5"> contain the kingdom message, which will give them this hope and comfort. The workers meet many people daily who manifest an interest in this message but who feel that they can not afford to purchase tlie books. Arc those people to be left hungry? Rather, the Society has decided to make a special offer to them by cutting in half the selling price for the set of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies</span><span class="font5"> for a period of eight days in order that all the people of good will mav &quot;partake of the waters of life’’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>What to Do Now</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer Set of Six Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During October and November, with the exception of the week set aside for ttie special drive with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Script urns,</span><span class="font5"> a special effort should be made to reach the farmers, who have been busy during the summer and fall with their crops. The harvest is nearly completed now. These people will be receiving returns from their crops and considering plans for their winter comfort and entertainment. We know that any plans that do not take into consideration the Lord and his goodness are worse than useless. Therefore it is the privilege and duty of God's anointed witnesses to do everything possible to awaken the people to a consciousness of their need in this cotmeclion. What better way can this be done than by calling upon them mid telling them about, tlie Kingdom and placing in their hands the kingdom message. This is the best time of the year to reach the farmer. He has the time to talk to you and to read, and has a general inclination to relax after a strenuous summer. He will have more money at this season of the year than al: any other. Specialize on the six-book combination for two-forty-five as your main offer. If conditions are such that tlie farmer is unable Io purchase the six books, of course smaller combinations may be arranged, always keeping in mind I hat the more of tlie books you place in tlie home, the greater the variety of subjects tlie purchaser has to consider, and the more likely he will be to find one or more that will appeal to him and induce him to investigate tlie message that the books contain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why, then, should one who really loves the Lord and rejoices in Ins truth hesitate to sell the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures f</span><span class="font5"> They contain the great fundamental truths of the Bible. They have brought many of those in present truth today to a position where they have learned to love and honor Jehovah. They stand as a testimony to the truth of tlie Bible statement concerning God’s giving to his people an ever-increasing understanding of his purposes. Uis blessings have so unmistakably been upon their publication and distribution in the past that those which he has placed in the hands of his people now become a real kingdom interest. In view of these points, should there be any doubt of their accomplishing still more good if they are distributed, when Jehovah himself says, in Isaiah 55:11, &quot;So shall my word be that gocth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void; but it shall accomplish that which I please, and It shall prosper in the thing wliereto I sent it”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Report for Nov. 10-17</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your weekly report for this special drive week should cover the entire eight days. Therefore each class director and colporteur will close his weekly report for the week commencing November 4 on Snlur-day November 9. The special drive week report: will commence with Sunday, November 10, and will close Sunday night, November 17. Please follow these instruclions carefully. Sharpshooters will kindly send in a special report also (separate from the regular monthly report), covering the sets of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> they have sold during the special drive week.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>44,571 “UH” THE THRILL IN IBSA WEEK</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Army of 10,088</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">You’re One of These, Aren’t You?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Was the past IBSA Week better than the one in -May? That's the question that has been in the minds of all those Interested in the Kingdom work. Now for Ihe figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the first place, the distribution of 3,500,000 circulars preceded the great chain broadcast over 97 radio stations, and millions listened to the heart-cheering lecture and rejoiced. Then 10,OSS messengers of the Lord responded to the call to action and joyfully went forth with the good news, selling an average of 12,868 bound hooks a day for each of the nine days. This represents an in-erense of 1,540 workers over the number responding during May. These were thrilled with the new book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font5"> and with the privilege of offering it io the people. Consequently the people could not but he impressed with their spirit arid their message. The totals show that almost 35 percent of all the purchasers bought st copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span><span class="font5"> The workers sold almost 5,000 copies daily </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">this new book, or </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">grand total of 44,571 copies for ilie entire drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now here Is an interesting fact. The number of 10c and 5e booklets which were sold decreased from 121,671 and 44,155 during May </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">IBSA </span><span class="font5">Week to 97,578 and 38,283, respectively, during the August drive. This made a decrease in the toliil literature distributed, which was 251,670, as compared with 262,548 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">May. However, the real witness given during the last IBSA Week was far grealer; for literature was left in 128,201 homes, as compared with 119,353 during May, or an increase of 8,848. The total number of cloth-bound books sold during the August drive was also far greater than during May, totaling 115,809, ns compared with 9G,6S0. Surely the results are gratifying, in that they indicate the real effort which the consecrated have put forth in singing the praises of Jehovah. The average number of hours spent in the work was slightly less for class workers, due to the large increase its tiie number who participated, but the auxiliary and regular colporteurs took advantage of the added day and increased their time in the field. Wasn’t it a happy time?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>A Helpful Suggestion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Tt will be uoted that since August 25 all watciitoweb chain programs are announced as sponsored by The Watch Tower, instead of by the International Bible Students Association. This emphasis of The Watch Tower during each week’s program will serve the double purpose of enabling radio listeners to identify the broadcast when they tuue in, and consequently to identify in the mind of the householder called upon by a worker that the books offered are more of the same message. Therefore, always mention The Watch 'Tower when calling upon the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Inventory</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The service directors will please see that their inventory is properly made out and forwarded to this ofiice as soon ns possible after October I.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Sell 1</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">9,129 More Bo </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Important to Class</span><br><br><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Colporteurs</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Change Takes Place Oct. 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another Important change takes place, beginning October 1. From now on there will no longer be a branch known as the class colporteur service. There will be only the pioneer and auxiliary branches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those class colporteurs who are putting in twenty-five hours or more a. week will be classified as pioneer colporteurs and be given pioneer rates. Those who work less than twenly-iive hours a week will be classed as auxiliary colporteurs. Their system of reporting weekly to the Society only will continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If there are others who arc able to give their full time to the colporteur work, but who, due to some peculiar circumstances, are unable to leave their homes which are in class territory, by making special arrangements with the colporteur department they will be granted the pioneer rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is essential that these nminge-merits lie made in this manner in order to assure the class workers of sullicient territory to keep all busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Weekly Reports for 1930</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In reviewing the matter of the submitting of weekly reports by directors during 1929, we find that as the year progressed the service directors became more and more appreciative of the need of submitting prompt, regular and accurate weekly reports. Al the end of 1929 it is noted that there is but a small minority who have yet to understand and appreciate the need of submit ting reports each week, whether or not any sales have been made. For 1930 we have set for ourselves a goal of 100 percent; so this minority will necessarily have to be overcome. It can, and by the Lord's grace, we hope to see it done in 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We wish, to strongly emphasize to the directors of 1930 that your cooperation is both requested and needed In order that we may be able to reach the goal mapped out. It’s a simple matter, requiring very little time and work, to make out and submit to us each week a report of the activities of your class. The thing resolves itself into a question of HOW much interest a director takes in his work. We find that the directors of the large classes, who have the most reports to gather in from the workers each week, submit weekly reports; it’s the directors of ihe small classes who fail to submit a report regularly. So it’s not a matter of amount of work involved, but is just a question of HOW much interest a director has in his work. Let each 1930 director take a personal interest in his work during the year, and, if this is done, we are most certain to reach our 100-percent goal. Let’s go to it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This applies also to the regular and auxiliary colporteurs. Let each colporteur take this to heart and really consider this as a kingdom interest.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>i</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ks than in M</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ay Canvassers’ Slips</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">These Have Been a Big Help to Many</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the friends have found It helpful to use the question slips that the Society publishes. We now have a new one, with questions on the six books, which, we believe, the friends will find helpful in selling the six-book combination. We are now offering these question slips to the classes at $1.00 a thousand, instead of the previous price of $1.50. Due to the fact that the friends have been using so many of these during the past year, we can print them In larger quantities, and therefore at lower cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The radio slips have also been reduced to $1.00 a thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Where extra printing Is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font5">done on these slips, or a different layout is desired, the usual price </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">$2.00 a thousand will apply, or $1.50 a thousand if ordered in lots of five thousand or more.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We trust that the friends will lake advantage of using the question slips and radio slips in their Kingdom work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">DO YOU HAVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A DIRECTOR?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are still n number of classes who have not sent in their recommendation for the 1930 service director. If we do not receive these recommendations, or some advice from the class explaining why they arc held up, we can only assume that it is the wish of the class to lie discontinued as a service organization and remove them from our tiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers to Receive One Copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">from Now On</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It lias been the custom.to send all full-time colporteurs two copies of each issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watch Tower; </span><span class="font5">but, from now on, only one copy will be mailed. If </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">sample copy of any issue Is desired, they should make a special request for it. Sample copies </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> will be mailed to pioneers </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(be </span><span class="font5">same as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Meaning of Symbol “jr”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some question has arisen in the minds of some of the colporteurs and service directors as to the meaning of the symbol “jr”, which lias appeared on the monthly statements of their book accounts. It stands for the set of till of Brother Rutherford’s books. Prior to the publication of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font5"> it represented the set of five, but now it represents the set of six. When combinations of less than the six volumes are ordered each book will be recorded separately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">books, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,464 </span><span class="font5">10c booklets, and 2,417 5c booklets. As with the regular colporteurs, tiie total of literature distributed was less than that during May, but the total </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">bound books was more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely it was a joyful occasion! Tile </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">new book </span><span class="font5">did put </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">LTFF </span><span class="font5">into the campaign.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Time an Interesting Factor Auxiliaries Averaged 20.44 Hours During IBSA Week</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">47,948 cloth-bound books sold In nine days! That's what 997 pioneer colporteurs reported for the August IBSA Week, which surpasses their total for the May drive by 6,477. During the nine-day period the colporteurs who reported averaged about the same number of hours each day in the actual canvassing; but instead of working eight days, they kept up a steady pace for the entire nine. Therefore the total number of horn's for each colporteur averaged 37.86, instead of 32.81. For some reason or other, the number of reports for the August drive fell off to 097, as compared with the 1,040 during May. With 1,218 entered on the active list, we are wondering what happened to the other 221.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">average number of books sold per colporteur during this period was 48.09, as compared with 39.88 during May. Why was this? Can you guess? Yes, it was because of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span><span class="font5"> Never before has il new </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">book </span><span class="font5">been taken up by the colporteurs as has this one. It shows how desir</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ous </span><span class="font5">they are </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">follow the Lord's leadings anil to carry on the work in his appointed way. During the drive 13,302 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font5">an equivalent of almost 28 percent of the total number of volumes, were placed by the pioneers, l-lnthusiasm for this book has been running high, but it is hoped that the decline In the number of sales of 5- and 6-book combinations which occurred during the drive will be changed to tin increase. Many of the colporteurs are writing to us that they are finding it just as easy to sell the entire set of .six books us it was to sell the live. We </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">would </span><span class="font5">encourage </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font5">to continue to work with the entire set of six, for we really believe that it will not only leave </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">wider witness for the truth but will also help you to continue in the pioneer </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sale of the 10c and 5c booklets dropped from 34,059 and 10,150 during May to 29,682 and 7,114, respectively, during August, but, surprising as it may seem, the total number of purchasers rose from 32,770 to 34,356. This shows conclusively that if one stresses a single book In preference to a combination of booklets, he will sell books. When he talks a larger combination, he sells them. Because of the decrease in the number of 10c and 5c booklets which were sold, the grand total number of pieces of literature placed was less than in May, being 84,744, as compared with 85.6S0. The witness given, however, was much greater and more effective, on account of the larger number of purchasers and the increased number of bound books placed, and also the greater number of hours given to the proclamation of the message, which totaled 37,756, as compared with 34,127.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work done by the auxiliary colporteurs was also very gratifying, in that 456 averaged 20.44 hours in the actual canvassing during the nine days, placing a total of 9,540 (Continued on this page, column 3)</span></p>

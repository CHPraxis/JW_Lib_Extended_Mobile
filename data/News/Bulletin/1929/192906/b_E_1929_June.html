<p><span class="font4">I USA Week lias come and gone. We are glad to tell you tliat the results have heeti beyond our expectation. The table shown above Indicates that we have just tormina led the greatest distribution of the Kingdom message that the United .^States has ever witnessed in So short a period of time. Thore hail been a greater number of workers in the field in the past, but never at any time had the number of hours been put in the service in so short a period as were put in during IB SA Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total average time for uux-ilhiry colporteurs and class workers was 9.54 hours. Ill this. 7.oil workers participated, making a total of 71,651 hours, or nearly 9.H0i) dsli.1-bour days. During this period ,8fi.7&lt;i8 dill'erenl. parlies purchased one or more books or booklets, in these purchases there were 55,215 hound books. This is more bound books than were sold during any four-wcok month this year. The same excellent results are evidenced in the sale of ten-cenl booklets. There were ■86.708 sold, which is more than were sold during any one month this year, with the exception of April, during which month 200 more booklets were sold titan during IBSA Week. Surely this is u marvelous record, indicating that the Lord's blessing was upon those who used their facilities to glorify His Name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A comparison with last year’s May IBSA Week figures also is interesting. During the slime period last year there were 45.8.1.4 bound books sold, or 9.-101 less than were sold in JBSA Week Illis year. During IBS A Week this year we had 440 less workers in the field in the class service. Nevertheless, because of added zeal and m’l.ivity. the Lord blessed tlieir efforts in a larger distribution of the bonnd books. The sale of ten-cent booklets last: year was 00.885, against 87,659 this year, or 3.226 more than this year. Tim I wus doubtless duo Io the fmt tliat efforts were concentrated on the distribution el' Ilie live-book condnmi-tirni. There were 7.600 loss of Hit' five-cent booklets sold this year, making a total of about 10,500 Iwjoklels (Continued on page 2, column 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">'file auxiliary colporteur division of the Lord’s anny tmmbarded the enemy with 8,391 books. 10,358 10c booklets, am! 3,096 r&gt;c booklets. The tot.nl ammunition poured out was 21,84,j pieces of literature. When the call lo battle was sounded. 470 responded, mid these have reported as being on the battle-front for an average of 19 hours during the week. There were 143 ‘casualties', by which we mean that this number of those on the list have not yet reporter!. We hope tlml these will rush in their reports so that wo shall Know tliat they have not been lost hi &quot;no man’s land”. Some of the literature was left with each of 9,279 prisoners in the enemy's camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Like tin- regular colporteurs, flic auxiliaries have been stirred with a burning zeal to “turn the battle to 1he gate” and have put forth a special effort in canvassing for the live-book coinbiiiatioiis, selling 927 of these, as compared w 11 ti 306 two-book combinations, the next; highest:.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">’There were 262.506, vr over a quarter of a million, books am! booklets placed in the hands of the people during IBSA Week! That Is the result of the combined efforis of all the class workers and colporteurs. When you consider that ibis represents books placed during :i total of 105,762 hours in the actual canvassing by a total of 8,548 workers, you have n lit Ue idea of Hie extent. of the witness that has been given in this country during this eight-day period. If the Lord, had appointed 1ml. one person to do this work-, it would have taken him 57 years, 1:1 months mid 10 days, working 5 hours a day mid 7 days a week. In his wisdom he has poured out his spirit on all llesli so tlmt all of the anointed might have the privilege of giving the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A lot.nl of 90,1180 bound books were sold, 121.671 10(i booklets and 44,155 5f booklets. As 119,353 people purchased the literature, flint</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Had a Splendid Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We feet that you would be interested in the report of the Bethel Family also during IBSA Week, Therefore we are glad to say that 184 members of the family were out in the service during the last, three days of that week anti wei-e able to place 2,239 bound books, and 4,960 ten-cent bookie Is and 1.365 five-cent booklets, or a total of 8.564 books and booklets. This menus an average of -17 books and booklets per worker. The family much appreciated this season of fellowship with the field-workers everywhere, The occasion was one of much blessing to them, as evidenced by the expressions of the different brethren at the conclusion of the three days Of field service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Even though there were 143 who tor from three to four days out of did not report., the final results j the eight, this army of 1,037 plowed show a marked improvement over through muddy roads and weathered that which was done at tliia time the storms for an actual average of last year.

<p><span class="font4">!would mean that probably at least | half a million riiJTerent people will now have the message in their home. Surely it is encouraging io see how the Lord Ims blessed “bis sons and his daughters” as they have carried out their divine commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are particularly impressed with these figures in that. I hey demons! rale turn’ those who are. of the remnant are appreciating more find more their privileges of service. 'There Ims been more lime spent in tin<sup>1</sup> field by the workers than ever</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">before. The regular mid auxiliary eofporteins have made records that will be difficult Ie equal, and the class workers have put in almost as much time as is customary for the auxiliaries. The result shows, therefore, that In hours spent per worker, Uris wn.s the greatest of all IBSA weeks. Tn 1927 there wore about 1.000 more workers in the field, with Hie result that the total of booklets sold was about 68,000 in excess; but 1:lie cloth-bound books sold were some 25,000 less than this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers Make Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Average 32.89 Hours During the Week</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were 85,627 books and booklets sold by the regular colporteurs during IBSA Week. Of this number, 41,465 were books, 34,012 10c booklets, uni] 10,150 5c booklets. The largest number of colporteurs in the history of the church participated in tins great drive. Reports have been received from 1,037 so tar, and it is apparent that there are still n few more to be heard from, since we have 1,217 enrolled. If you are one of the 180 who haven’t reported, please hurry in your curd so that our records may be completed.</span></p>

Il was a beautiful song tlml: was sung, and 32,745 appreciated it enough to purchase some of 1.1 io lilernturc. Of 1he combinations sold, the five-book seemed to be the most popular; for tlie total number was 4,529. as compared with the 2,297 of the two-book combinations, the next best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now we should like to give you an accurate comparison of this year’s work with that of lust Maj’; but since the figures compiled for 1928 were for only seven days instead of eight, we m e unable to do so. However, when you realize tliat during seven out of the eight days of May IBSA. Week of 1928, 580 colporteurs instead of 1.037 participated and only 11.088 cloth-bound book-s instead of 41,465 were sold, we feel tliat: yon too will have much cruise for rejoicing. The IBSA Week ending September 1, 1928, was better than the one tn May, 1.929, but at that only 749 reported selling 25,451 cloth-hound books.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">cessity of buying more than one map for each county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another advantage derived from tins map is that in allotting a section to any ear or number of cars care can be taken to sec that there are sufficient homes on each road to keep the workers busy during the time allotted for the work. It should be made an objective for each driver to sec that the section of territory assigned to the car is completed in the time allotted. Of course, where weather conditions upset your plans this can not be followed out to the letter; but generally speaking, this method </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">can be </span><span class="font4">used to advantage. This colporteur says relative to this method of working rural territory; “We have been using the rural route map system as suggested in the Winter Colporteur Bulletin, and also the two-car and flag arrangement [described on page 11 of the same]. We all like it very much and have been doing thorough country canvassing in a systematic way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another feature of planning your rural work is to carefully ascertain whnt the different districts produce, On account of the wide range of products and the great difference in climatic conditions. It is impossible l.o state in a general article like this just whnt would be the best season for working each rural section. But each director should make n careful study of his territory to see just what time of the year the farmers are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">most</span><span class="font4"> likely to have the money with which to oblain the books, In a general way, sections which are devoted to dairying and truck funning should be good to work in the spring and early summer, when the grass is green; for then the cows are giving plenty of milk and there is also a good market for early vegetables. Sections that raise wheat, oats and other grains should be good to work when the farmers receive money for their crops. In most sections grain is harvested in July and August. Corn, apples, potatoes, cotton, etc., are the full crops; and tobacco, which is cored after it is cut, is usually not marketed until November or December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course many of the farms produce several different, crops; but if a study is made of the territory to ascertain when the farmer is most likely to have the money with which to buy, and he is called on then, It will be possible to place more literature; and this will also serve as an encouragement to the workers. The same principle applies to local industries also. If all conditions are taken into consideration and the workers are placed in the sections when the people are likely to have the money a thorough canvass should be made of the entire assignment at the best seasons of the year. Class workers can assist the director in securing tin's information by filling out the complete information on their workers’ slips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be found that if consideration is given to these various points it will materially help in the distribution of the message in these sections; and the friends’ being able tn get better results from the efforts put forth will be a source of encouragement to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Order Blanks on Hand</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We recently shipped to the different classes a three-month supply of order blanks Io be used for ordering literature. Some of the classes have already used most of these blanks. Where any more are required, an order may be sent to this office and we shall he glad </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4"> furnish more.</span></p>

<h1><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>Maps Aid in Planning Work</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">The favorable summer weather has come at last and the ideal time for working the rural territory is here. However, many of the advantages available when working rural territory arc often lost, due to lack of careful ijla'nning and systematic study’ of the territory conditions. Therefore, in making your plans for this year, arrange to get cither a rural route map, as suggested in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Special Colporteur Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> (Winter Edition), or a county map subdivided into townships, which can be had at the office of the county highway engineer (generally in the court house building of the county seat), or at some printing office for ten oi' fifteen cents. Sometimes these are handed out free as a means of local advertising. However, the post office maps are the best; for the others do not always show the highways and the homes. If the post office rural route maps can not be obtained, these latter will give you an outline of the different townships and their relationship to one another, which will be an advantage in planning your work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Where the post office rural route maps are obtainable the service committee should take this map and carefully study the different roads, count the houses on the road and make arrangements for a sufficient number of cars and workers to work the different sections intelligently without duplicating or waste of time,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR VIRGIN TERRITORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The facts have demonstrated that each year a number of roads arc ignored because they are rough and generally hard to travel, but on which from twenty to fifty farmers are found to live. These are the best possible prospects for our literature. They are hardly ever canvassed by any of the firms who usually send their men out, due to the fact that they are so far from the main highway. Some colporteurs have been known to sell from one to five books in every home iu these “backwoods” places. Therefore, in planning for your rural work this year, give special attention to the people who live away back from the main highways, and see that they are worked during June, July and August, while the roads are in pretty good condition and before harvest work sets in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MAP</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A very good way to use these rural maps is suggested by a colporteur. &quot;A driver’s guide” is made covering the portion of the territory that the driver is going to. work on any particular day or drive. This guide is made by pinning a piece of typewriter tissue paper to the county rural route map just over the route you want to take and then tracing off a map covering Hie section of territory to be worked. Put directions on it, with the regular dots representing the homes, school-houses and churches. Draw in all the cross-roads, in fact everything that appears on the original map. When this section is to be worked, give it to the driver, with detailed instructions showing him how to get to the part where he is going to begin work. If you have two Or more cars in that section of the territory, carbon copies of the section can be made for each driver, with instructions where to start and where to finish, so that one driver will not bo working the territory of another driver. This plan eliminates the ne</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Colporteur Not to Serve as Stockkeeper</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our reports indicate that in some classes the stockkeeper appointed Is also an auxiliary or pioneer colporteur and in many eases the class and colporteur stocks get so mixed that it is next to impossible to know what belongs to the class ami what to the eoiporteur. This has worked a hardship to the colporteur and to the class. We request therefore that arrangements be made that the stockkeeper be some one other than a colporteur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Who Is Entitled to Class Rates on Books?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When interpreting the January </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> regarding the number of hours necessary to get books at class rates some of the directors have gone to the extreme of insisting that the workers sign a card or a slip of some sort before they can receive the literature at class rates. It was not the intention of the Society that this should be done. It is up to each individual to determine whether he is spending on an average of three hours a week in the service or not. It is entirely between himself and the Lord. If any misrepresent the facts for the purpose of gelling the books al class rates without: complying with the time requirements, they are answerable to Ilie Lord, and not to any human Iteirig. Therefore, any brothers or sisters going to the stoekkeeper and requesting books nt class rates indicate that they arc putting in the necessary time to entitle them to such rates.</span></p>

But this is more than offset in the 9.401) bound books that were sold over last year’s figures. for each bound book contains approximately six times as much Information us the ten-cent booklet, and constitutes a more permanent witness. The report is encouraging also from the standpoint of the sale of bound-book combinations. There were 8,022 bound-book combinations of all sorts sold, against 20,797 single bound books. Practically half of the bound-book sales were eomliiiiatlons of two or more books. Therefore, from whatever standpoint this IBSA Week’s activity is viewed, it only emphasizes Ihe thought that the Lord’s hlessing was with his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much could be said in favor of every feature of the work, but space forbids us to go into much detail In this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font4"> There was only one disappointing feature in evidence, and that was that 91 classes did not report at all. 11 would seem that classes that are not sufficiently interested in the Lord's work to either report their activity or send in some explanation of why they were unable to cooperate with the rest of the church throughout, the earth during this special week are not sufficiently interested or active to be retained in the list of organized classes. However, we do not wont to cast ii shadow’ over Hie excellent results of IBSA Week by dwelling upon this feature; but: in fairness to the classes that did report we want to say that even the excellent results that were obtained might have been still bel l er if all classes Imd fully reported.</span></p>

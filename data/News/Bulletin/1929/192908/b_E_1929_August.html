<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Inaugurates Campaign</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Millions to Be Informed of Broadcast on Aug. 25 </span><span class="font3">It is with great pleasure that we tell you that at least 75 stations are to be linked together on August 25 In this great international network. The message to be given hy Brother Rutherford, “Health and Life for the People,” will inaugurate the IBSA Week campaign. This will prepare the minds of the people so that they will be in a receptive mood when the workers call witli the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ADVERTISING </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">LIFE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to increase the effectiveness of the hook-up the Society has prepared a new radio flier specially for this occasion. On one side appears the announcement of the hookup, giving the time, date, subject, and list of stations. On the reverse side is the picture of a man reading </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font3"> and a word or two about the book. The announcement is attractive, simple, and to the point. We are sending a few samples to the classes so that the friends can get a better idea of it. Beneath the announcement of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> is the statement that a world-wide distribution begins August 25. Colporteurs desiring to have a part in this work should send in their orders soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We here remind you of the instructions contained In tile July 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> regarding the distribution of the announcement slips. The workers should begin using them about three weeks before the date set for the hook-up, handing them to those on whom they call, ut the conclusion of the canvass. One week before IBSA Week concentrate on the larger cities and towns, giving special attention to those sections that have been set aside for IBSA Week canvassing. The largest number should be circulated during the three days just before the broadcast. lu this way the broadcast will be fresh in the minds of the people, and also the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For newspaper advertising the Society will be glad to furnish plates at 50c each, or mats at 10c. Before ordering make sure whether the newspaper you intend to use requires the plate or the mat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Inclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> the director will find a suggestion for advertising the broadcast on the spare tire of your automobiles. You can follow the design suggested, having some painter in your vicinity do the work for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By giving the hook-up wide publicity in the above-mentioned ways it is hoped that a larger number of people will be reached and prepared</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Life,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Big Hook-up, and Make Your Plans Early for the Field Work</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">August is by far the most outstanding month of the year 1929 as far as the Lord’s anointed and their commission to be his witnesses are concerned. The new book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font3"> is to be released for public distribution during IBSA Week of that month, giving us a combination of the six most attractive and valuable books in the market to offer to the people, the value of which can not lie estimated in dollars and cents, because they contain a message of hope, peace and life, without which all else is worthless. IBSA Week starts on August 25, and a great international broadcast on the subject “Life and Health for the People” will introduce the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> and inaugurate the drive. This broadcast will take place from ten to eleven a. ni., Eastern Daylight Saving Time. With these three great contributing factors the August IBSA Week should result in the greatest of all witnesses to date. Brother Rutherford has so arranged the time of the broadcast that practically every worker in the United States, Canada and the isles of the sea may be able to listen in on the talk before they start out in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">TUNE IN</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wherever possible the classes should arrange to have a good receiving set in their places of meeting, so that they can bear the message while they are assembled for service. The friends should gather at the meeting-place an hour, or at least half an hour, before the broadcast takes place, so that all arrangements, such as territory distribution, transportation, supplies of literature, and any other details pertaining to the day’s activities, may be completed before the broadcast commences. As soon as the program is concluded let each one take his place, advancing as a part of the mighty army of Jehovah, singing the honor of his name. In this manner all the Lord’s anointed from coast to coast will start as one mighty unit in declaring the purpose of Jehovah. Surely the prospects of having part in this great drive will thrill the heart of each anointed child of God and will induce each one to make a special effort to have part in the opening of the campaign as well as continuing the united effort throughout the nine days of IBSA Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We would suggest that on the opening day, particularly, the friends east of the Rocky Mountains take their lunch along with them when</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>ive Aug. 25 - Sept. 2</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Six-Book Combination</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">they assemble for service In the morning, and, Immediately following the broadcast, go forth into the field, spending the remainder of the day iu the service. This will avoid the necessity of returning home for their meals and will enable each one to make the opening day the big day of the drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THREE BIG DAYS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a climax to August IBSA Week we have Saturday, Sunday and Monday, Angust 31 to September 2, during which practically all the friends will be released from their secular employment and thus be enabled to devote the entire time to the witness work. There will, consequently, be more time available for the work than there was during May IBSA Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A method that has been found very beneficial in using periods like this has been to have a number of the friends get together on Friday evening or Saturday morning and go to some of the larger towns in the outlying territory and establish a headquarters, and work from that headquarters during the three days. Thus they save time and energy and give a much more effective witness than if they hud to drive to the territory every morniug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We would recommend that in setting apart territory for IBSA Week the service committee consider this proposition and lay aside some territory for those who wish to undertake a week-end drive as suggested here. Definite provision should be made to supply sufficient territory for every brother and sister iu the class who has all or part of these three days available for service. The responsibility to make these provisions rests primarily upon the service committee in each class. However, if no provisions are made by the committee, it would be the duty of the class to request that such arrangements be taken care of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">YOUR VACATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another matter that should be given consideration during this period is that at this season of the year a number of friends are enabled to take their vacations. Surely nothing can bring greater joy or satisfaction to the Lord’s people than devoting a certain part of tfielr vacation period to the work of magnifying the name of Jehovah. The joy that this brings is not to be compared with anything else on earth. Therefore we strongly urge that, wherever possible, the friends arrange for their vacations so that the vacation period will include IBSA Week, and in this manner (Continued on page 2, column 2)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>“Simply Beautiful”</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Adds One More Color to Our Attractive Set</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">You all know that Brother Rutherford has written a new book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life, </span><span class="font3">because the July 15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Walch Tower </span><span class="font3">announced it. But we just must say something about it. It is a clothbound book of 364 pages, Is printed in a little larger type than our other books, and contains six tinted pictures Illustrating different passages In the book. There are also eight paintings, reproduced in four colors, which add to its attractiveness. As for the cover, it is of beautiful red cloth, upon which “LIFE” is stamped In brilliant gold. The center panel is embossed in a most striking way. But we will not say any more about It, except to repeat that “it’s simply beautiful”. As for the most important part of the book, the message it contains, it will thrill your heart as you read it, refresh you with its timely truths, and increase your love for the Lord and his cause. This message is not for ouly the consecrated, however, because everybody wants life. When canvassing, try asking the people, “You want life, don’t you?” Of course they must say “Yes”. Then offer them the book and show them how life can be obtained. We believe these books will sell like pink lemonade on a hot day at the circus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“When can we start?” Wait a minute; we’re coming to that. Tbe &quot;Author’s Edition” has been sent to all organized classes, as announced, and the regular edition will follow, so that every one will be supplied before IBSA Week. On August 25 IBSA Week will be introduced by a nation-wide broadcast, and when advertising this hook-up </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> will be advertised at the same time. The new radio flier will prepare territory for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span><span class="font3"> Thon on August 25 the campaign with this new book begins, and is to be stressed all through IBSA Week. The people want “LIFE”, and now we have it for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">COLPORTEURS TO ORDER</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The colporteurs are going to have it too. Beginning August 1, we can fill orders for colporteurs from all depots, except Oakland, which will have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> on August 5. This vvill be in ample time for a supply to reach you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Isn’t it great how the Lord provides these good things to give the people from time to time I We know you will agree and say, &quot;It surely is!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Possibility of Surpassing May’s High Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On your marks! Get set! All are awaiting with anticipation the starting signal of the next great attack, wbicli opens with the big radio broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The colporteurs are urged to hurry In their orders for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font3"> so that after the lecture they will be ready to rush out into the field with this wonderful new book added to their coinbin ation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wliat are you going to do during tins coming IBSA Week, colporteurs? Can you surpass that wonderful record you made in May? Let’s see what the possibilities are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">NINE-DAY DEIVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This coming IBSA Week you will have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nine</span><span class="font3"> days instead of only eipftl. With one Saturday, two Sundays, and a holiday, there is an advantage of a holiday over last May. With the additional day you will have the opportunity to talk to more persons than usual. May was a rainy month, whereas during August the country roads are usually good and the weather better. Thus there should be a good chance for improvement in tiie average number of hours in the work per colporteur. Tiie number enrolled is about the same. In May there were 1.248 regulars and G16 auxiliaries. Now there are 1,255 regulars and 617 auxiliaries. But of those enrolled in May, only 1,040 regulars and 474 auxiliaries sent in their reports for IBSA‘Week, These figures include the few straggling ones which were received after tabulating the figures for the June </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span><span class="font3"> Therefore there is another opportunity for surpassing May’s figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And don’t forget this GREAT BIG ADVANTAGE. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> will be added to the campaign. Isn’t that a wonderful title? When you see the book, with its encouraging message and its beautiful binding, pictures and pages, you'll be so anxions for the 25th to arrive that you’ll find it difficult to wait until the starting time for offering it to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Everything points to an even greater IBSA Week for the colporteurs than that record-breaker during May. To accomplish this, however, it will mean a lot of work, for remember what you did in May. In that IBSA Week 1,040 regular colporteurs averaged 32.81 hours in actual canvassing and sold 85,680 books and booklets. Then 474 auxiliaries averaged 10.G8 in the actual canvassing and sold 21,940 pieces of literature. That makes a grand total for ail the colporteurs of 107,620 for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">eight</span><span class="font3"> days’ work. Can you surpass it? We know that you want to because of your love for the Lord and yonr desire to have an ever-increasing part in spreading the message of his kingdom. The total number of 42,899 hours given in the service by all the colporteurs thrills us ns much ns the number of books actually sold; for It is really the effort put forth that is most pleasing to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tire time is not far off. Begin to make your preparations now, so that you can be in the field as much as possible during these </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nine</span><span class="font3"> days. If you have to move to a new territory, you should be there before August 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Continued from page 1, column 1) for the house-to-house work of IBSA Week, thus affording a greater and more favorable field for the message of the Kingdom and Its blessings.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Director Appointments</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On July 15 we forwarded to the secretary of each organized class the annual request for the names of three brethren from which the Society will choose one to serve as director for 1930. If this matter bus not been brought to the attention of tiie class by the time you receive this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font3"> please ascertain the reason, and if tiie secretary did not get the above-mentioned letter, advise us immediately and we will forward another. All classes should have this information in the Society’s office before September 10, so that they In turn may be advised of the appointment by October 1, which is the beginning of tiie Society’s business year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Consignments of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Consignments of the new book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font3"> are being made to all tbe classes whose accounts are in good condition and who have not specially requested that no consignments be made. Classes which do not receive such a shipment should send in their order direct, so as to have the books for IBSA Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some of the auxiliary colporteurs and sharpshooters are being consigned a few of the new books, also provided their accounts are low enough to warrant it and, further, that their reports indicate that they are placing enough books to make snch a shipment advisable. If you ate an auxiliary colporteur and do not receive a consignment, you will understand the reason. We suggest that you order, then, the number you desire, since we do not wish to overstock any one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On account of the frequent changes in the addresses of regular colporteurs, no consignments are being made to them. Full-time colporteurs should order their own stock of books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Continued from page 1, column 3) they can use the time to the Lord’s glory nnd their own blessing and refreshment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Preparations for this IBSA Week will be the same as those for the May IBSA Week. Please read carefully the suggestion on planning for drive week outlined in the March </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font3"> and the questions for service committees and workers in the May </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font3"> and make your arrangements accordingly. We were very much surprised and much disappointed to receive advice that some of the classes made no special effort to arrange for pressing the witness during IBSA Week in May. Any class finding their service committee either negligent or indifferent in regard to their privileges in this connection should take the proper steps to have the committee removed and some competent brethren appointed in their place. The Kingdom and the witness which tbe Lord will have given regarding it are the biggest things in the world, and nothing should be permitted to interfere with our privileges in relation to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">EVENING WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">August IBSA Week has many advantages over that of May, in that we have longer evenings for evening canvassing. Weather conditions are better and the friends have gotten into the swing of canvassing, and a much more effective witness should be given. In this connection it is going to be very interesting to watch the comparison between the May drive and the August drive. During May the class workers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Sharpshooters’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IBSA Week Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For IBSA Week's report the sharpshooters will please use one of their monthly cards and cross out the word “Mouth” and mark it “August 25 to September 2, IBSA Week”, and report their sales for drive week on that card. This is in addition to your regular </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">monthly </span><span class="font3">report. Send in your monthly report as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">throughout the whole United States averaged 9.54 hours each in the service and sold 176,921 pieces of literature to 86,608 purchasers. Witli the advantage of weather conditions tiie total sales of literature during the August drive should exceed 200,900 pieces and the number of purchasers should reach 100,000, due further to the fact that we have nine days for the August drive and had only eight days in May. These figures, of course, include the auxiliary colporteurs also. Let each of us determine that, by the Lord’s grace, we are going to put forth the accessary extra effort to bring the sales up to those suggested above. iVe are convinced that tiie Lord will idess the effort if we honestly endeavor to do this thing to the glory of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The territory to be worked during August IBSA Week should be the most densely populated portion of your territory not already covered with the bound-book combinations this year. Check up on yonr territory situation. Know it thoroughly before IBSA Week, and have each captain familiar with it, so that the drive will he inaugurated without any confusion or duplication of effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">COMBINATIONS FOR IBSA WEEK</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The combination that is to be specially pushed will be the six bound books: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life, Government, Reconciliation, Creation, Deliverance </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font3"> for $2.45, There is nothing else In the world that can be compared with the combination that yon have to offer the people. This set of volumes contains the Kingdom message, which is essential to the people in order to get life, peace, and happiness. Therefore a very special effort should be made to place the entire set in all tiie homes possible. The prospects of placing this library of the Kingdom in the hands of the people now at a price that they nsually have to pay for one volume of fiction or other literature in the market today is something that should enthuse every one of the Lord’s people, because one is offering the people something better than reading material : one is presenting to them the knowledge of God's provision and arrangements by which they may have peace and happiness and, Ultimately, life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SIX BOOKS TIIE BIG THING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let no worker hesitate to offer this combination of six books to die people. Tiie average person will be glad to take the six books as quickly as he would take three for half the price. Many sales of complete sets are lost on account of the timidity or diffidence on the part of the friends In presenting the entire combination, If for any reason you are unable to place the six bonnd books In the hands of your prospect, then drop immediately to a 75c combination composed of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font3"> three ten-cent booklets, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend, </span><span class="font3">This presents a most attractive variety, one book and four booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Classes and Colporteurs Reminded to Send</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">But One Report for IBSA Week</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the adding of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> to the books to be sold a new report curd has been made for both classes and colporteurs, with a special column provided for reporting its sales, and a new space for reporting the number of purclmsers who hove bought the six-book combination. A consignment of the uew cards is being sent to the classes; but </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">not to the colporteurs,</span><span class="font3"> on account of their frequent changes of address. In case the colporteurs have any of the old cards on hand, we ask that you use these before ordering the new ones, by making tiie following changes on your present card:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Cross out the “Set 7 vol. Studies” heading and write “Life&quot; above this. Report therein tbe number of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> sold. Then for reporting the number of six-book combination purchasers, divide the column for reporting the live-book combinations, using the first half of the column for reporting the number of five-book sales and the other half for reporting the number of six-book sales. If you sell any sets of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Studies</span><span class="font3"> during the week, report these in the blank space at tbe bottom of the card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Together with the colporteur’s copy of this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> a “supply order blank” is inclosed. Please read this over carefully, and when you are in need of some new report cards fill it out In accordance with the instructions and send it In to us. These “supply order blanks” are not inclosed with supplies of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> sent to classes, as they are for the exclusive use of colporteurs. Colporteurs are urged always to use them for ordering supplies, so that they will be sure to get the supplies. Please print your name and address plainly, so that there will be no mistake made by the post office. A new slip will be included in each order of supplies sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Again it is called to the attention of all classes and colporteurs that for IBSA Week there is to be but ONE of the regular weekly report cards made out. Do NOT make out two, but merely send the one card for all sales made from August 25 to September 2, inclusive. This will mean that your report for the week preceding IBSA Week will end with August 24. The report for the week following IBSA Week will begin with September 3.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Don’t Forget: Bethel Is to Be Closed Aug. 18-Sept. 2 </span><span class="font3">Colporteurs and classes are again reminded of tbe vacation period of the Betbel family, during which the factory and office will be closed from noon of August 17 to the morning of September 3. Be sure to have plenty of hooks and territory to last through this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">dealing with vital features of God’s plan which can not bnt appeal to those to whom they are offered at a price well within the reach of every person’s pocketbook. If you are unable to induce your prospect to take your second offer, then drop immediately to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> alone for 45c. Endeavor to leave a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> in every borne possible. Keep in mind that this is a special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> drive and that every home shonld have a copy of this book whether they have any of our other literature or not.</span></p>

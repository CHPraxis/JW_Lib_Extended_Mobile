IBSA Week, August 25 to September 2, will be inaugurated by a nation-wide hook-up. The president of Ilie Society will give a lecture over this coast-to-coast network on the subject, “Health and Life for tile People.” A sixty-minute program, originating in New York city, will begin at </span><span class="font4">ten </span><span class="font2">a.in., Eastern Daylight Time.

<p><span class="font2">To avoid confusion and the misunderstanding which some of the classes have had about reporting work done during IBSA Week, it has been decided to eliminate tlio specialty prepared curd for IBSA Week. For the drive of August 2-5 io September 2 the classes will follow the practice observed by the I colporteurs during the May drive, i.i».. of using one of their regular weekly report cards. Instead of reporting Um work done during the seven days of tlio week only, this : card is to be held until 1 lie conclusion of IBSA Week and Ilie results of the entire nine days, from August 25 to September 2. are to be included. This will mean, then, that the report for the week following will be for a period of only five days instead of seven. Colporteurs, as well I as classes, are asked to follow this practice. Remember, then, that only mm report card for the entire nine days is In be sent to us for next . IBSA. Week.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>of Regularity</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Regulars and Auxiliaries Sell 122,722 Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May’s figures have now been compiled. The results show that both the regular and the auxiliary colporteurs put In their best month SO far this year. During the month 1,092 regulars and 523 auxiliaries, or a total of 1,015 reported at least once. The average to report weekly numbered only 907 and 419, respectively, or a total of 1,320. But the 1,326 worked more diligently during this month than during any previous month of the year. The regulars averaged 24.47 hours a week In the service, and the auxiliaries 11.30 hours a week. This Is a marked increase over April’s figures, which were 21.43 and 8.40, respectively. It but demonstrates what can be done when the colporteurs really put forth the effort; and we want to congratulate you for your good work. W'e feel sure that Ulla has been a very Joyful month for you; because when one puts forth a real effort to magnify the name of Jehovah, he is sure to receive a rich blessing. In fact, from the many letters that we have received from all parts of the field testifying of the joy that has been experienced </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font4">mighty campaign, we are assured of this. That the Lord’s blessings were on your efforts is clearly </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">manifest </span><span class="font4">in the sale during the month </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">268,828 pieces of literature, which includes 122,722 books, 109,721 10f booklets and 36,485 5^ booklets. This literature has been left in the hands of 106,204 purchasers, which does not represent the total number, because many of the colporteurs have not been reporting them on their weekly cards. It will be much appreciated if in the future every </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font4">makes out these cards carefully and is sure that all the requested Information is filled </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Summer is now here, and with It come better weather and roads. The farmers are beginning to harvest their crops, and they will be in possession of money with which to purchase the literature. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The best </span><span class="font4">months of the year are before you. Now is the time to start ‘making hay while </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">sun </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">shines’, as the </span><span class="font4">saying goes. If you wish </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to stay in </span><span class="font4">the colporteur work until the end and without Interruption, we </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sug</span><span class="font4">gest that you put in regular </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">hours </span><span class="font4">each week and endeavor to meet the minimum average at least. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">This </span><span class="font4">minimum has been set with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">your </span><span class="font4">own interests at heart. The May figures demonstrate that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tho only </span><span class="font4">way for one to meet his expenses in the work is to really seek </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">first </span><span class="font4">the interests of the Kingdom, which means to work hard. Due to much backward weather, which </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">has dis</span><span class="font4">couraged many farmers as to the prospects of a good </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">crop; the </span><span class="font4">seasonal depression which usually conies during the month of May; and the Increased number of new and inexperienced colporteurs who have engaged in the work, the average sales an hour per colporteur </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font4">creased to 1 1/5 cloth-bound books, 1 10 booklet and 1/3 5tf booklet Hence, if you wish to continue </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font4">the work, regularity Is essential; for only by putting in the time can the books be sold. We appreciate the many difficulties which you encounter, and want to assure </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">you </span><span class="font4">that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font4">is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font4">earnest desire </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to co</span><span class="font4">operate with you in meeting them.

<p><span class="font4">(Continued from page 1, column 4) says: “I want to thank you so much for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Special Bulletin,</span><span class="font4"> May Issue, which you sent me. Sunday morning, when I was out In the service, 1 put In practice many of the invaluable suggestions from this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font4"> and I had more success than I had ever had. Three out of every four calls were sales; and bound books, too.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Special Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> has been Issued for the benefi t of the workers; and we would urge that it lie kepi as a manual and referred to repeatedly. One can not remember all the suggestions by just reading it over once or twice. We suggest that each worker, before going out into the work, read part of it, try to remember a point or two, and then experiment with these in your canvassing. The next time you go out, try some other suggestion; and finally you will have proven to yourself the value of the suggestions made therein and will have made them your own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One sister writes us how her having followed the suggestion of agreeing and sympathizing with the customer aided her in placing the message in the hands of a party who would not otherwise have listened. She says, “I approached a lady who was sitting on the porch. She Said to me right away, ‘Ob, I am sick and nervous and I can’t read. It makes me so nervous.’ So I put up tho book and said, ‘That is to bad, I atn sorry.’ Then I said, ‘Won’t It be grand when the Lord will heal the nations and make the earth beautiful and there will be no more sickness?’ To my surprise she said she was looking for this very thing, and her face looked so happy as we talked. Then I said, ‘You know these hooks of Judge Rutherford are right along this line.’ She said, ‘Is that so?’ And eagerly she picked one up and began to look at it. She couldn’t take all, but took </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span><span class="font4"> I have been wanting to know how to canvass better, but my lack of knowledge has caused me to act and speak in the wrong way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Suggestion for Answering “I Haven’t Any Money in the House Today”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A brother writes us, “Here’s a little suggestion for what it is worth. When they say, ‘Well, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">haven’t any money in the bouse today,’ and seem a little interested, just pull out your order book In a confident way and smile and say, ‘Oh that’s all right; we’ll just open a charge account for you. When is pay-day? I’ll see you then,’ and either leave the books and collect Inter or deliver later as you are accustomed to do.” Another brother writes, “I have had a number of successful sales of the sets by taking a deposit where I size up the person as reliable.&quot; The taking of a deposit and giving the customer a receipt with one book oftentimes impresses the customer with the obligation which he has incurred in leaving the order with you and aids in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">making the </span><span class="font4">delivery inter </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of the fall order,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Bicycles Used for Rural Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Colporteurs Have Covered as Much as Sixty Miles a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Day Without Difficulty</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now is the time to cover the rural sections. Some of the colporteurs in times past have used bicycles to good advantage In this work, but with the coming of the automobile many have overlooked their possibilities entirely. You might, therefore, be interested in the experiences of some of those who have been using them effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The bicycle is comparatively cheap and easy to operate and to keep In repair. Because of its serviceability and economy as a means of covering territory, some colporteurs In house-cars have carried one along with them as part of their equipment. The heavy house-car can he parked, and gas, oil, and expensive tires saved, while the rough roads and rural sections are being canvassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One brother writes us that he is able to cover from 30 to 60 miles a day without trouble on his bicycle. Another one tells us that in his usual day’s canvassing he figures on traveling about 30 miles and on delivery days he often covers as much as 50 miles. Of course endurance like this comes with practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAPS A GREAT HELP</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You might be interested in knowing just how he plans his work. As soon as an assignment of a county is received, he obtains a map showing the rural routes. If he can not buy one from the government or some store, he goes to a public library where he is frequently able to trace off a copy of some map on their files. He then selects some centrally-located town as his headquarters, where he keeps bls stock of books and from which he rides out each day. A carrier arrangement which bolds a suitcase is attached to the front of his bicycle. (Some prefer to have a rack in the back, as well as in the front, so as to more equally distribute the weight.) He claims to be able by means of this to carry as many as 65 books without overloading, With a stand attached to the rear wheel, the bicycle is held in an upright position while the call is being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As he starts out each morning he loads up with enough books to keep him busy for the day. He so plans his work that the delivery date for any orders that are taken is set two weeks from his first day’s work in that particular section. By doing this, he is able to allow those who give him orders nt the end of the week, one week’s interval before the delivery. The orders taken during tlie week warrant his spending another day in making these deliveries in that section after having canvassed It.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If one does not feel capable of traveling so far to and from the territory, several changes in headquarters can be made. In this way all the rural route in the county can be reached with the least amount of traveling. This brother informs us that when he has taken an assignment of a county he calls at every house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The hicycle can be used not only by pioneer colporteurs but by class </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">workers </span><span class="font4">as well. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Many </span><span class="font4">of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the classes have done very little In their rural</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Territory Boundaries</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It has just come to our attention that instructions have been given to certain classes without consulting the Society’s headquarters to disregard their territory boundaries In disposing of their surplus stock of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peopled Friend</span><span class="font4"> booklets. The instructions should NOT have been given. It is important that all classes and colporteurs observe strictly on all occasions the boundaries of the territory which has been assigned. When these boundaries are disregarded, some one else suffers. Classes or colporteurs should never work outside of their own territory. The only exception would be where classes have a working agreement with one another to assist in their respective fields; but even in such a ease definite arrangements should be made first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Individual friends are also urged not to follow the practice of taking a bag of books along and working any place that might look good, without knowing who holds the territory. Your doing so may be with a desire to honor the name of Jehovah, but it may mean that you are working in some pioneer colporteur’s territory whose livelihood is dependent upon his sales of books. All isolated territory should be obtained from this office, as the Information regarding where the colporteurs are working is available only here.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The early summer opens up an excellent field for the Kingdom message in the various resort hotels, among both employes and guests; and plans should he made to work these at the most advantageous times. It is often difficult to reach tho guests of the very large ho'tels, but the smaller hotels and boardinghouses can be reached if plans are carefully made anil competent workers appointed to handle the work. The employes also can be reached in the same manner. Each case will be a problem for the director to work out. No specific plan can lie made to cover all of these, lieyond the fact that in most cases the employes can be reached between 3 : 36 and 5:30 p.m. and after 8:30 p.m. This would provide excellent evening work for brethren who have to work during the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Novel Suggestion for Selling Booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One colporteur writes us that their party has been able to place a number of booklets in the hands of people who are not iu position to purchase the set of five books. She writes, “We are putting all the booklets together and calling them our paper-covered set.” Having talked the cloth-bound set first, one has emphasized the desirability of such a purchase. A paper-covered set at a very small price is thus made to appear very attractive.</span></p>

Sisters who have considerable time during the week have not gone out into the work because of having no one to take them. Women as well as men can obtain bicycles adapted to their use. They are easy to learn to ride, cheap to operate, and cover the ground quickly. They have an added advantage in working rural sections, in that no time is lost in waiting </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for other members of &amp;&nbsp;party to finish their calls.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Strong in the Lord and the power of hist might, the little bund of the Lord’s anointed again obey the command of their great. Captain and go forth to sing aloud the praises of their God. The great enemy, Satan, with his Hf.upendous power, would frustrate their efforts, but 'he that is with them is far greater than all the opposing hosts'. In faith and confidence, and with great rejoicing, preparations have been made for another IBSA Week. All is in readiness for the great drive to begin. Three and a quarter million leaflets advertising the radio hook-up and the new book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font4"> have been printed and distributed. Announcements have appeared in many newspapers and have been made over a large number of radio stations. Then from const, to coast is heard the key-note speech as Brother Rutherford addresses millions of listeners over a vast hook-up of more than seventy-five radio stations. Was there ever a time more opportune for calling on the people? Naturally the remnant awaits with keen anticipation the time to offer </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font4"> to the people. At last it comes. For nine days without a let up, culminating in a whirlwind finish during Saturday, Sunday and Labor Day, they 'press the battle to the gate’ and find tiiat again ‘tire Lord of hosts is their strength and n crown of glory and a diadem of beauty unto them’. Surely it Is a time of great, rejoicing, for action in the Lord’s cause always brings joy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">LIFE, LIFE, LIFE, LIFE I Louder and louder grows this glad refrain as those in suffering and misery learn through the pages of this new book bow life is to be obtained. All mankind want it; but before they get it they must first know the way. Therefore this IBSA Week centers around </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span><span class="font4"> &quot;Six books for $2.45” features the campaign. If the person called upon is unable to take all six, each worker drops to a 75c combination made up of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font4"> three ten-cent booklets, mid a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">People* Pricnd.</span><span class="font4"> But If still unable to spend that much, then </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life </span><span class="font4">alone for 45e is offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A harmony and unity of action exists among those who see eye to eye, even as the Lord has promised. Bethel Is closed so that those usually engaged in making the books can join their brethren in the field. Their vacation period coming at this time finds them scattered into many parts of the country and coming as a reenforeemeiit to the little companies of the Lord’s anointed here and there. Classes have been stocked with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font4"> and the colporteurs, us ever, stand ready to cooperate in the same great campaign. Having helped to prepare the field by the radio, the radio workers show their willingness to be used by the Lord in any and every capacity and they too get their hag of books to go out into the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a privilege it is to join in with such a band of devoted workers who serve the Lord because they love him above everything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In August 1926 IBSA Week the classes placed 18,881 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance, </span><span class="font4">which book made its initial appearance at that time. Last August, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font4"> was the special book In the campaign for the five-book combination. At that time 12,086 were sold. What will be the record for 1929, with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lifet</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“Have you finished reading </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life!&quot; </span><span class="font4">“Sure thing!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, no doubt, you feel just like all those from whom we have been receiving letters during the pa4it few weeks. How’s that? Well, you can hardly wait for IBSA Week to start, so that you can get out into the service and OFFER </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">LI I'D</span><span class="font4"> TO THE PEOPLE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And speaking of letters, we wish that you could read over some of the many that we have received from the colporteurs. They seem to be thrilled with the prospects of this new book. We nre looking to them to do some big things during IBSA week. That you may enjoy with us some of their good letters, we are giving you a few excerpts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I received the new book. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life, </span><span class="font4">and think it wonderful. I want to do all J can to put the wonderful message of life in the hands of the people,”—Colporteur in Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I have just finished reading the new book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span><span class="font4"> It’s wonderful. I enjoyed it from cover to cover and prayed silently all through its pages for strength and power to be able to put them out, rejoicing every step of tiie way.”—Colporteur in Arkansas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I feel that if I did not write to thank you for timi wonderful new book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font4"> I would be like the lepers Jesus healed who went their way and forgot to thank their healer. The book stumps truth inside and out.”—Colporteur from California.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“We received the new books entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font4"> and appreciate them very much. We hope to be permitted to place many of them In the hands of the truth-hungry people.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>September an Ideal Month for Canvassing</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord, through his prophet, calls upon his people, saying, ‘Trove me now' herewith, salth the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.” We are convinced that this will be the happy portion of all the Lord’s witnesses who have been faithfully engaged in his service, particularly during the August IBSA Week. We believe that the Joy and the blessing which the Lord will have poured out upon his people will be a source of stimulus that will make September the greatest month of 1929. There is no greater joy on earth than the consciousness of spending one’s vitality in obedience to the Lord’s command; and although many of the workers may he physically tired and weary from the effort put forth, the joy that is their portion will undoubtedly more than compensate for It. This joy may be theirs permanently as they continue to use theii-power to glorify the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">September is the most ideal month of all the year for canvassing. The weather is brisk and invigorating without being cold. People are. In general, settling down after a more or less restless summer. Children have returned to school, and people are considering the weightier things of life. Their minds, in many instances, are turned to educational lines. Most homes have children in the primary school, In college, or In the university. They nre spending much money in the education of these children. Many are wondering what returns it will ever bring them. God's witnesses should take advantage of this trend of thought in the minds of the people. Most branches of education taught in the institutions of this world arc at best only man’s conception of things. The wisdom of this world Is their highest standard. This wisdom may or may not help them in coping with the selfish competition that exists in the world, but it offers absolutely no consolation, help or comfort in the preparation for man’s eternal destiny. It contributes nothing iu his fight for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">'Therefore, at best, the people are merely feeding upon husks and are dissatisfied. There is only one way to life: ‘This is life eternal; to know thee, tiie only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.’ God's witnesses, therefore, anointed by the Lord to carry his message to the people, hold the key to happiness and peace of mind, yea, even to life itself, in tile ministry of reconciliation that the Lord Ims committed into their care, to be his witness to ah the people about the planting of , the new heavens anil the laying of j the foundations of the new earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To any of the Lord’s people who have taken the trouble to write down and carefully consider and compare the seventy-two chapter titles contained In the six books written by Brother Rutherford, it is very evident that the Kingdom message which the Lord has provided for the people is not complete unless the entire six volumes are placed in each homo. In this connection we would strongly recommend that each worker take the lime to copy down and carefully consider these seventy-two titles. lie should go over them repeatedly, so that he may have clearly before his mind how very important and essential each one of the six books is, in order to carry out Ilie commission from the Lord to properly place with the people the message of reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore September's first and chief offer Is the six-book combination, al. $2.45. You can not effectively present this combination unless you realize its import yourself. Therefore we emphasize that each one try to visualize the Importance of the message these books contain, in order that you may present it to the people with greater force and conviction. In territory where a large number of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font4"> have already been placed and it is deemed advisable to offer a five-book combination, offer the set without </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font4"> for $2.10. In territory where </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> have been widely distributed, the remaining four books may be offered for $1.75, From this time forward our object should be to place the entire set of six in the home or fill in the remainder of the combination for those who have some of our books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During recent months one out of every fifteen to eighteen sales has been a combination of five books. We lieiieve that the same percentage of six-book combinations can be placed if the friends familiarize themselves with the importance of the message they have for the people and consistently offer it to them. Of course where conditions are had and the people have very little money, smaller combinallons can be prepared and offered to them. However, it should always be kept in mind that the message of the Kingdom which Hie Lord has commissioned us to bring to the people now is much more necessary aud essential to them than anything else they could have for their money. Even the small amount of food that they could buy for the nominal sum that is asked for our literature would last, them for only a very short time; while the comforts and blessings from the Kingdom message that is obtained from the literature would be theirs for all time.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Important Features of Service Organization</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>All Should Re Familiar with These</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">For the benefit of the classes ami their service committees and individual members we give here a brief summary of the things that arc essential to a proper service organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">WHO CAN ORGANIZE FOB SERVICE </span><span class="font4">In order to maintain a service organization </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font4">class should </span><span class="font2">have </span><span class="font4">at least four members who not only can but will engage In the canvassing work with </span><span class="font2">some degree of </span><span class="font4">regularity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THE TWO PARTS OB' A SERVICE ORGANIZATION </span><span class="font4">Each service organization is composed of two parts, both of which must work together in order to give the witness effectively. These two parts are tile service committee and the workers, The service committee consists of the service director, the stockkeeper and the service treasurer. In a small class it Is all right for the director to be stoekkeeper also, but the position of servlet treasurer should be held by another member and should not be combined with another office in the service organization. It is the responsibility of the service committee to formulate plans of action. These planar* to be presented to tlie workers for their discussion and approval. It will then be the responsibility ol the workers to carry Into action the plans finally agreed upon by the majority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">DIRECTOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The director is appointed by the Society and serves as its representa- i tive. Ue Is also the representative of the class, inasmuch as he is chosen by the Society upon the recommendation of the class. He is therefore a servant of both the ee clesia and the Society. The duties of the director are twofold. His responsibility to the class is that of directing its service activities; and bls responsibility to the Society is that of carrying out the instructions he receives from the office from Him-to time through TFatcft </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tourers. Bulletins,</span><span class="font4"> letters, eie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SUBDIVIDING THE TERRITORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the director’s chief dutie’ is to see that the class territory i: properly subdivided into personal assignments and canvassing-partj assignments. This division should be so made that the class can work it most effectively. lu order to de this the director must know the territory: the naLlonalities in the various sections; the class of peo plc, whether rich, poor or middle class; when the people are paid: what are the best days or seasons to canvass, and why; the approximate number of homes in each assignment, etc. This will enable him to determine how many workers cat: cover a certain part of the territory I in a given period of time, and will I eliminate much waste of time oe- i casioned by sending too many work- i ers into an assignment, or not j enough. This information should be <sup>! </sup>recorded on tlie workers’ territory I datu slip. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THE BEST WAY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">TO CANVASS TERRITORY i</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having properly subdivided the. territory and knowing it, the ilirec- : tor is charged with the response i billty of arranging to have it ; worked by the workers best suited ' to the different sections. Some workers are better fitted to meet Hie wealthy and educated; others, the middle class or Ilie business people,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">KEEP WORKERS IN</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CLOSE TOUCH WITH INSTRUCTIONS </span><span class="font4">It is Hie duty of the director to bring to the attention of the class all instructions and communications from the Society, so that Hie class rittiy know what each worker should do to give the most effective witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">MONTHLY STATEMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each month a statement of the class account, is forwarded to the class in care of the director. It is the special duty of the service committee 1o examine this statement of tlie condition of the class account. Further, the service committee shall give to tlie ccclesla, through its service treasurer, an account of the amount of money that has been remitted to the Society during the month, the value of the books still in stock, and tlie amount of money on hand. The last two items should be sufficient to balance the amount due the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REPORTS AND CORRESPONDENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each week the director is to make a report, to tlie Society on the regular weekly report card, whether there lias been any work done or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All correspondence of tlie service committee with the Society is to Ite done by and through the director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Once each month tlte director should make a report to the ecclesia of what has been done during the month and of ihe plans outlined for the coining month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The director is to see that a record is kept of the sales made, hours canvassed, number of purchasers, elc., in each town, so that be may be able to make out a yearly report when culled upon to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ASSISTANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The director should appoint u worker to act as his assistant The assistant will aid the director in carrying out all the details of bis office as may lie requested by tlie director, anil will act in tlie place of the director In all matters when for any reason the director is unable to' act. Particularly the necessary detail work of keeping records, handling reports and making up the weekly report, etc., should be assigned to Hie assistant director. The assistant should endeavor to relieve the director of till the detail work possible, so that Ihe director may-have more time for the direct: supervision of tlie work in progress mm for planning tlie work in prospect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tlie director is io do everything possible, not only to see that the work is properly mapped out, but also to encourage and stimulate the workers by concerning himself with their problems and offering, sympathetic suggestions that will help them to meet: the conditions in the ter ri lory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">STOCKKEEPER</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The stockkeeper will have charge of all the supplies of literature furnished by ihe Society for the service work. It is the duty of the stock-keeper to keep full aud accurate account. of the stock committed to Ins care. All supplies for the work will be obtained from the stockkeeper. Tlie best course to follow is for the workers to pay cash for all hooks obtained from the stockkeeper. Credit may be extended to such workers as can not advance the money for tlie books, with the understanding that It is the duty of the service treasurer to collect from them the price of the books as they are sold, and, in case the worker is inactive, to notify the stoekkeeper.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Recommendations for Directors</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Regarding your recommendations for directors for 1930: There are sti.il a large number of classes that have not sent in their recommendations. Kindly see to it that tins matter is given consideration and that the recommendations are forwarded before September 10. We note that the brethren in the foreign-language classes have been very slow about sending in their recommendations. These, as well ns the English classes, arc urged to give this matter attention nt the very first opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">who will request Ihe return of the books that have not been sold. The stoekkeeper should turn over to the service treasurer all money received for books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The stoekkeeiier will make out orders for literature as may lie required, using the regular order blank, and hand the order to the director for liis approval, The director will send in the order to the Society, Always try to place orders for id least one hundred pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">DO NOT STAMP LITERATURE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Books and booklets are not to lie stamped with the name and address of tlie ecclesia, nor with any other in formation. Neither should any circular or card be inserted unless such insertion has been approved by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SERVICE TREASURER</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service treasurer will liavc charge ot nil money received from the sale of the books which have been shipped to the ecclesia by the Society. The service committee will make up the account once n month, and each month the service treasurer, as the representative of the ecclesia, will pay for all literature <sub>4</sub>&lt;old during the month, turning tlie cheek over to the director to forward to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">WORKERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The workers arc those consecrated ones who take an active part in the service, and upon them depends to a very large extent the measure of success of the plans of action. The service meetings are Intended to bring the workers in close touch with the plans of action, so that a united front may be presented to the enemy. The workers can greatly assist the service commitlee by sincerely endeavoring to carry out the instructions for action issued to the committee by the Society. By submitting to the director prompt reports of their activities they will enable the director to send in to the Society without delay the regular weekly report requested of him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">PRICE OF BOOKS TO WORKERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each worker who engages in the held service an average of three hours a week, and so reisirts to the service director, will be granted class rates on the books. Workers who do not average three hours a week will pay the regular retail price for tlie books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">OTHER POINTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Workers only should have a vote in the plans of action to be undertaken by them. II: depends upon them to carry out the plans, and therefore they should determine what course of action is io he adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the event that, the director should be unable, neglect, fail or refuse to carry out the instructions of the Society, the workers should bring the matter to the attention of the ecclesia and of the Society as soon ns possible, Tt is hoped that</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Classes and Colporteurs Urged to Report Promptly</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Do you want to know the final results of IBSA Week? Of course you do ; and so do we. And, besides this, you arc anxious to know the total results of the year’s work, which ends with September 30. Now each colporteur and class can help us greatly in obtaining these final figures by promptness in sending in their weekly report cards during the month of September. Colporteurs are urged to make out their weekly reports each Sunday night and mail them at once. Class directors are also specially requested to mail their reports as early us possible. If you are a class worker, you also can help in this by so reporting your weekly activities that: the director can tabulate the class figures by Sunday night. IC you don't do this, it delays his report to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Remember, but ONE report is requested for IBSA Week, from Sunday, August. 25, to Monday, September 2, Inclusive. The report for the week preceding will be to August 24, and for the week following will begin with Tuesday, September 3.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>July Report</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The Inly report of the classes and colporteurs, with a combined sale of 178,871 books and 220,220 booklets, is very gratifying. With August, September, and IBSA Week yet to hear from, our propects for 19211 are the best yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Continued from page 1, column 2) It has been more than twenty-five years since we frst entered the colporteur work.”—Colporteurs in Arkansas,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘‘Have just received the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font4"> for which I am very thankful. What I have read in it makes ine want to be on the firing-line more than ever,”—Colporteur in Kentucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We received the new book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life. </span><span class="font4">Sister K---- and I are thankful to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the Lord for this line gift from you. The book is attractive, the cover massive, tlie contents and pictures up to date. The book will sell like hotcakes. We believe all colporteurs arc eager to place this book among the people.”—Colporteurs in New Hampshire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I wish to express my appreciation of the new book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life..</span><span class="font4"> It is certainly beautiful ami will surely awake the remaining good people out of their slumber. I myself shall do my best, with ail the help our Lord has so graciously provided.” —Colporteur in New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The colporteurs are such a joyful aud appreciative lot of people that we can’t help but love them very inneh because of their devotion to the Lord.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">this action will not be necessary, but the work in any ecclesia should not be hindered by inattention of the director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Neither the service committee nor any member of it is authorized to involve the ecclesia in any financial obligation without first getting tlie consent of the ecclesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Books are to be sold nt the price fixed by the Society, and workers should offer literature for sale at that price, known as the retail price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In ec-cleslas having no brother available to serve as director but having enough members to carry on a service organization, a sister may net as class sharpshooter, whose duties will be similar to those of a service director. The ecclesia may make its recommendations to the Society accordingly.</span></p>

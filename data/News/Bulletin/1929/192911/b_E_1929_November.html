<p><span class="font4">On account of some of the service directors’ not knowing in advance about the information which would be called for in their annual territory report to the Society, they failed to keep a complete record of the class activities during the past year. When the report was requested they were unable to furnish the complete data. In order to safeguard against a recurrence of this situation, directors and colporteurs are asked to read and follow carefully the following instructions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Directors, or their duly appointed assistants, nre to keep a record of the books placed in EACH town assigned to the class, books placed In rural territory to be Incorporated under the town from which the rural routes emanate. The Information required to be kept for EACH town will be the SAME as required from week to week on the weekly class report card; in other words, not only the books and booklets placed as appearing on the report card, but also the hours canvassed, obtainers, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to keeping a record of the work done by the class workers in EACH town assigned to the class, as stated above, the same information is to be kept of the work done by any colporteurs, auxiliary or pioneer, who may be working in the class territory. In this latter case, the colporteurs are requested to cooperate. To properly do so, each colporteur working In class territory is to give the director a full report of the books placed, hours canvassed, etc., in EACH assignment received from the service director as soon as each assignment has been completed, and at the end of the year on any uncompleted territory.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Work Increases 101 Percent Over Last Year</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">During the year beginning October 1, 1926, to September 30, 1927, a little bund of full-time colporteurs worked hard all year to place 224,345 cloth-bound books. Then the spirit of the Lord stirred up the zeal of others, for ills time had come for a far greater witness to be given to the honor of his name. The colporteur list began to grow. The following year’s report indicated an increase of 1G2 percent in the total number of bound volumes placed. During that twelve-month period an average of 444 regular colporteurs reported weekly and placed 588,662 cloth-bound books. The increase was amazing. Would it continue? Some may have said, ‘No, the zeal of the friends is merely spasmodic and the next year will show a reaction.’ Now the time has come to give you the report of what did happen. Not only have the colporteurs equaled last year’s high peak, but they have actually surpassed it. Instead of there being a decline, the average enrolment during the year 19281929 has grown to 1,132, and the average number to report weekly hag increased 90 percent, or to 834. These have placed 101 percent more bound volumes in the hands of the people than they did during last year. Think of itl Within two years’ time the average number of , full-time colporteurs in the field r eBrtr'wT’vk Tins Increased from 227 I to 834; and the total bound books placed, from 224,345 to 1,184,478! It ■ is almost unbelievable, but it is the <sup>;</sup> truth, nevertheless. But that isn't : all. In fact, besides placing over a million cloth-bound books during ; the past twelve months, they have disposed of 855,616 Wtf booklets and 393,522 5^ booklets, or a grand total of 2,433,616 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A total of 957,674 different families have been made glad by this literature which has been placed in their homes; and many more have received the witness at their doors without response, as the total number of hours spent in the actual canvassing indicates. This was 910,-35G. It would have taken one man almost 208 years, working 365 days a year and 12 hours a day, to accomplish tills. Surely the Lord’s time has come for the witness to be given that he is God,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Throughout the year these colporteurs have averaged 20.98 hours n week in the actual canvassing. We arc glad to report that during the past few months there has been an improvement in this weekly average, and it Is hoped that during the next year the pioneer colporteurs will show a marked improvement. It is because we desire to see the pioneers continue in the service that we try to encourage them to give more time in the field work. An average of 25 hours weekly should be the minimum, and, to really make a success of the work, much more . time than this shonld be given. One would hardly expect to hold a secular position very long by giving this amount of time. Surely the Lord’s work Is far more important than merely working for one’s daily, bread. Full time in the work is still the pioneer requirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of the 010,356 obtainers, 324,(536 took one eloth-bound book, 74,431 two books, 25,962 three books, 10,297 four books, 109,038 five books, and 7,786 six books. Thus it is seen 1.1)at of the combination offers, the five books proved to be the most popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All colporteurs reporting weekly placed an average of 1,420 books, 1,026 10(1 booklets, and 471 booklets during the year, to 1,148 different people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Truly it was a wonderful year for the regular colporteurs. Never have they left such a wide witness for the truth nor covered so much territory. While the quota of 1,400, 000 books and 1,600,000 booklets was not reached, that which was accomplished was truly remarkable. With ihe new system of reports now being kept, it is hoped that a more accurate basis upon which to figure the estimates will enable the colporteurs to make their next year’s quota.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Shows Big Increase for 1929 Nears Half-Million Mark</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Seven years ago the Society announced the opening of a new branch of the service for those who could give at least ten hours a week to the coIjM&gt;rteur work. This was called the auxiliary colporteur service. The report at the end of that year indicated that the average number to have their names on this list each month during the year was 194. The years that followed showed an increased interest in this work nntil the peak year of 1924 was readied, at which time the average enrolment was 364. Then there was a slight decline until the beginning of 1928 when many of the anointed became more appreciative of their privileges of serving Jehovah. The enrolment during that year jumped to an average of 515 for each month. Of this number who have bad their names on the active list, not all, however, have reported regularly, each week. As a matter of fact, during the year 1928 the average number to report each week was only 263; and during the year just closed, 409. This represents an increase of 55.3 percent over last year’s record. Isn't that encouraging? We know it is, especially to those who have enjoyed the blessings received from the increased opportunity of service which this means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A comparison of the number of books placed is equally encouraging. In 1928 the total number of books placed by the auxiliaries was 108,708 During 1929, tills figure was increased to 158.099, or by 45.4 percent.

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">The uniformity in the activity of the classes throughout the country has been a great incentive to the weak and timid workers and has done much to encourage them, greatly contributing to the wonder- । ful witness given during the past year. There are very few organized classes in the country now that are not in the field at ten o’clock every Sunday morning. The chain hook-up causes the Lord's message to penetrate the walls and prepare the people to receive the Lord's witnesses. The large number of brethren who have reported to this oilice the favorable reception they have received at the different homes during the time the radio programs are being broadcast is an Indication that this is the ideal time to call upon the people. The Lord seems to bless this united action of the radio service and field service lifting up the voice and with the voice together singing the praises of Jehovah and witnessing to the people regarding the establishment of his kingdom, as well as declaring the judgments written against the Devil's organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">After the November 10 to 17 drive with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in ihe Scriptures, </span><span class="font4">which will then revert to their original cost of $2.50, every class should return immediately to pushing the campaign with the six-book combination in tlie rural sections before the extreme weather sets in and makes it very difficult to reach the farmers. There is no question that tills is the most desirable time to do this part of our work. This work should commence immediately, and should continue as long as pos-placcd; so there is no basis for a comparison. However, the present results show that, in addition to the books, you placed 157,713 10^ booklets and 172,029 Peoples’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Friend </span><span class="font4">booklets, or a grand total of 487,841 different pieces of literature. This is almost a half-million pieces of literature which have been left in tlie homes of 220,017 different obtainers. Of this number, 65,802 secured nt least one cloth-bound book, 6,475 two books, 2,477 three books, 1,607 four books, 12,326 five books, and 643 six books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The average number reporting weekly failed to come up to the time requirement set for this branch of the work, averaging only 8.45 hours a week in the actual canvassing; but it is hoped that the new arrangement, permitting the auxiliaries to count their Sunday time, will enable them to maintain the average of 12 hours during this coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During 1he past year those reporting weekly placed an average of 387 books, 386 10 booklets, and 421 5(1 booklets, with 538 people.</span></p>

It will release a number of the friends who at present have to devote a certain amount of lime io radio activity and will enable them to enter the field. It will facilitate arrangement for a definite time to commence the proclamation by radio and in the field, and thus, going forth as a unit, the Lord’s army will be irresistible. The Lord, through his prophets of old, particularly in Isaiah 53 and Joshua 7, seems to suggest that this method of attack is intended for this time. Therefore we suggest that all classes, in every language, arrange to cancel all services prior to four o'clock in the afternoon on Sunday and be in the field at ten o’clock ready to commence with those of like precious faith throughout the North American continent.</span></p>

But we are faced with that inconvenience throughout the wilder in the various secular pursuits in which some are engaged. Surely if we can endure such Inconvenience to carry out our responsibility along a secular line, we should be willing to endure far more to carry out our commission from the Lord. There is a tendency on the part of some of tlie friends in different sections to feel that because the weather has turned a little cold, and, as a result, the work becomes less convenient, they should cease activity until tlie warm weather returns. However, when we realize the importance of the commission that tlie Lord 1ms given his people, and the groat privilege of being associated in that work, there is no possible inconvenience sufll- ' eiently great io cause us to slack our hands at this time.

<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Message Placed in 2,184,744 Homes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The complete report for the class activities for the past year is something that will bring great, joy to the hearts of those who were privileged by Ilie Lord's grace to have a part therein. In every branch of activity it exceeded our expectations. While some features of the quota have come short, it has been more than imide up by activities along other lines that were not included in the original quota. Thus from the standpoint of the distribution of the message the year’s work was au entire success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> the local activities are dealt with each month, and ■ in this issue a summary of the year’s activities throughout the country is submitted. During flic past year the kingdom message was placed in 2,184,744 homes by class workers, auxiliary colporteurs and sharpshooters. Allowing an average of five people to a home, that means that the kingdom message was made accessible to almost 11,000,000 people in the United States as a result of your activity during the past, year. Surely this is n marvelous witness, the greatest that has ever been given by the classes of this country ; and undoubtedly it. is Ihe Lord's doing. In the 2,184,74 1 homes you placed 3,410,27(1 different pieces of literature, or 1} pieces for each •homo. By &quot;different pieces of literature” we mean cither a book, a booklet, or a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples’ Friend,</span><span class="font4"> When we compare this with the fact that, there are 13,000,000 homes set apart for the classes in the United 'States to he witnessed to each year, It indicates that about one-sixth of the homes accepted some portion of the kingdom message during the past year. This is the greatest record that has yet been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As time goes on many more people will come to realize their need : of more knowledge of God’s king-; (loin and the blessing it will bring to them, so that the work of the i coming year should even exceed that of the past year. Those who have received some of the literature will be anxious to get more, and their friends, who undoubtedly will hear about it, will be prepared to receive some of the literature. Therefore our prospects for 11)30 are very encouraging Indeed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Viewed from one standpoint we - did not reach the quota of 900,0(10 bound books and 1,400,000 ten-cent booklets that we set for ourselves last full, having placed only 730,525 . bound books and 1,022,275 booklets; but in addition to this we placed 1,357,476 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples’ Friend</span><span class="font4"> during the year, which were not considered in the quota. This more than offsets the shortage in books and booklets, which was loss than a half-million pieces. The quota of workers for last year was exceeded. The quota was an average of 4,000 workers a week, and we had an average of 4,309 in the Held weekly. The quota of hours set was on average of four hours a worker each week, and we reached an average of 4.5 hours a worker. Taken as a whole, therefore, these figures Indicate that those friends who participated in the work during the past year have a keener appreciation of their privileges and are therefore more consistent and regular in the work, and spending more time in the service; and as a result the Lord has blessed them by permitting them to give a greater witness limn ever before. IVe might say in Uns connection that the peak of number of workers dropped 400 from the peak of 1928, showing that: there are fewer actual workers in the service, but, despite this circumstance, the Lord gave a greater witness than ever before. This in itself proves that it is the spirit of Jehovah upon his people that is doing the work; that Jehovah is not dependent upon human agencies, and uses them only as they are wholly devoted to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Unite Efforts</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In connection with a united drive on the Devil’s organization in the large cities, where there are a number of classes speaking different languages, it might be well to have n “get-together” meeting on a Sunday every month or so, all participating in Ihe drive in their own territory from ten until two or three o'clock, and then assembling for testimony and refreshments, in this way stimulating and encouraging one another; for in the Anal analysis God's anointed are all one people with one common objective: that of glorifying the Lord. While the brethren speaking the different languages can more effectively serve people speaking that, language, and for that reason should organize separately, they should not lose sight of the fact that they are all a part of the servant of Jehovah, with one common commission which all are responsible for fulfilling. They should therefore meet periodically, check up the territory covered, and see how the work is progressing amongst them and cooperate more effectively in carrying out our commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wo hope that all classes will follow the practice of starling in the field service regularly every Sunday morning at. ton o’clock, so that this united drive on the Devil’s organization may be prosecuted with force and enthusiasm.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Directors’ Change in Address</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The Service Department of this office should be immediately advised of nil changes in the address of service directors. A SEPARATE letter concerning changes in address should he addressed to this department. A notification ONLY to the Watch Tower or Gohlen Age department does not reach the Service Department; and, therefore, mail sent to the directors regarding service matters is frequently delayed on this account. Directors will ay-ways he certain to receive their service mail promptly if they follow this suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Colporteur Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As stated In the “Announcement” in the October </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font4"> auxiliaries are to make out but one weekly report card henceforth and to send it direct to this office. NO colporteur report is to be included in the weekly report of the class. However, each auxiliary colporteur working in class territory is to turn over to the service director a complete and accurate report of the work done in each assignment received from the class, when so completed. The information to be given for EACH district assigned is the same as appearing on the weekly report card, namely, cloth books listed, booklets, hours canvassing, combinations, etc. The auxiliary does not make out any yearly report; his yearly report data is that which he turns over to the service director in whose territory he canvasses. This same rule likewise applies to pioneers working in class territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Continued from pngo 1, column 4) </span><span class="font4">Lord’s arrangement. The Lord places the members in the body as it pleases him. When the Society, established by and used of the Lord, determines upon a policy or course of action, every one who is a part of the Society must of necessity recognize that he is then bound by that policy and charged with the responsibility of carrying It to a successful conclusion. When the Lord definitely states that he places the members In the body as it. pleases him, then lie, end he alone, is responsible for its policy. I am convinced that he is behind his organization ; therefore I rejoice to have a part in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have canvassed for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies </span><span class="font4">for the past fourteen years and have never known of any one to whom they have not proved to be a blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why any should take themselves so seriously as to practically say to the Lord that that which he provided for his people during the Elijah period is now unfit for food, is beyond me; and I trust that, by the Lord’s grace, I may never get info a position where I would criticize him or his arrangements as his people of old did, with such terrible consequence to themselves. “To obey is better than sacrifice.”</span></p>

By thus carefully planning the work, the most inaccessible parts of (he assignment will be worked under the most favorable conditions and the main roads and cities he left for the extreme winter, when the other parts can not be reached. AU the friends in the class should try to cooperate willi the service committee to the fullest extent in carrying out this campaign. If the service committee should require fifteen workers to clean up a certain part of the territory hefore winter sets in, and only five respond for this part of the work and the other ten insist upon working somewhere else, it means that only one-third of the work I that should be done can be accomplished before the winter sets in and I makes the territory inaccessible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Undoubtedly every one who can is anxious to be out in the country during this ideal fall weather. Where the privilege of serving the Lord and witnessing to the Kingdom may be combined with healthy and beneficial recreation, those who take advantage of such opportunities receive a double blessing. Housewives and mothers who find It difficult to get very far from home because of their household responsibilities may, in many cases, be able to take advantage of these privileges, because iri many cities there are arrangements to look after the small children in the schools during the noon hour. The schools provide lunches and supervise the recreation of the children when it is necessary for the mother to be away for business reasons or where the children live so fur from the school that it Is dangerous and impracticable for them </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to go home for</span><span class="font4"> lunch. We are advised that the care taken of tbe children during this period is exceptionally good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would he within the rights of any mother who is engaged in business to avail herself of this provision during the time, or on the days, that she is thus occupied. The Lord’s business is the most important business on earth; and surely if parents avail themselves of this arrangement in order to take care of secular matters, the Lord’s people who have a commission from him to be diligent proclaiming his kingdom will be glad to take advantage of it also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to get permission to leave (heir children in the care of the school, it is necessary for the parents to make application to the school board or principal and state specifically the days they wish to do so. We understand that the cost of the meals rims from about 15e to 25c a day, Ou account of prejudice, probably, (he school hoard may not consider the proclaiming of God's kingdom a sufficient reason for giving permission to leave children in the care of the school. However, there is no reason wby the school board should be informed of the nature of the business which makes it necessary for the mother to be away from home. On those days when you intend to take part in the house-to-house work, all that is necessary is to state that you will be engaged in business and therefore desire to take advantage of the school’s arrangement for looking after your child, or children, as the case may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We would recommend that the director arrange to get Information ns to whether there is such provision in your city, and if so, to instruct (hose who wish to make application for the privilege, or have some competent brother or sister do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore real cooperation is necessary to see that the different features of the campaign are successfully carried out.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">‘ During the past year more terri-i tory has been covered in the United : States than ever before. Pioneer colporteurs have been working in many counties which have hereto-I fore never been canvassed, and the f classes and colporteurs have been working In many remote rural sec-i tions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">i On account of this some are in-i dined to say, ‘Well, now that we I have canvassed our territory there i is nothing more for us to do.’ But <sup>1</sup> is such an attitude pleasing to the ■ Lord? When the Lord sent Moses to t Pharoah he did not tell him to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">go </span><span class="font4">, only once, but had him return time ! after time. .Moses did not stop until ! the Lord’s time bad come for him I to lead the people out of Egypt. I Likewise Noah preached concerning i the coming flood, year after year, r So at this end of the age, once over I a territory would not indicate that ! there is nothing more to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord desires his anointed at this time to continue In this work, [ even though it be to cover the same i territory many times each year, until his due time to do his mighty act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When you stop to consider the matter, territory should not be con-<sup>1</sup> Sidered as thoroughly canvassed until it lias been gone over at least eight times a year. Why? Well, per-; haps the first time you call, no one ‘is nt home. The second time, the lady of the house Ims just had a quarrel with her husband or the milkman and feels too grumpy to listen to you. The third time else , has a cake in the oven and has not time to listen. The fourth time she has on her hat and coat and is just : going out. The fifth time, as you are talking to her, the baby starts cry-. Ing or the telephone rings and detracts her attention. The sixth time I she lias been prejudiced by her ; preacher, listens to what you soy, but ■ will not respond. The seventh time , she becomes more interested but i her husband is out of work and she doesn’t consider the books of suffi-<sup>:</sup> cient Importance to deny herself : Other things. Finally, the eighth time, you have the opportunity to i talk to her when she is In a receptive attitude, and takes the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘But,’ you say, ‘suppose that Um first one who calls leaves the books, then what about the other seven calls which are made?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much good can be done by all seven. As our mission is to educate • the people concerning God’s purposes, a word of encouragement can be given to get her to read the hook she has. Figures show that while ’ the five-book combination was the most popular in the combinations distributed during the past year, yet the majority were single book distributions. Hence, those who ob--taln one, two, three or four books can be encouraged to read those they have and to complete their sets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If it were true that books can not be placed in territory which is recun-vassed, then </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp,</span><span class="font4"> which the friends have been offering to the people du Hag the past eight years,</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">would be at the bottom of the list in the total number placed. But this year's report shows that, instead of being at the bottom of the list, It is actually at the top, leading with a total of 384,896, und </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation </span><span class="font4">coming second with 371,285. ‘But,’ you say, ‘this must be because of the large number of pioneers who have been in territory which has not been canvassed heretofore.’ The fact is, however, that tills Is not the case. With the pioneers, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation </span><span class="font4">led with 241,029, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp </span><span class="font4">came second with 237,176: On the -other hand, in class territory which has been worked repeatedly the auxiliary colporteurs show </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font4"> leading with 31,045, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crea-' tion</span><span class="font4"> second with 29,526; and the classes reported </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font4"> leading with 147,720, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font4"> second with 130,256. In other words, in territory which is canvassed and re-eanvassed, the demand for the literature is stimulated rather than diminished. One person takes a ixiok, reads it, likes it, and tells his neighbor about it. If he docs not read it, it is then time for some one io cull on him and encourage him io do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let us remember that we are nol book agents, but witnesses for Jehovah to educate the people concerning the fact that he is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this connection, we urge the friends to work all territory as thoroughly as possible each time they go over it. Why? Experience has shown that if at the first time over a territory it is only partly worked and a few books left with a few different people, the second one who calls is likely to find a great deal of prejudice. After the first worker leaves the territory the preachers soon learn of bis activity. So few having receivefl the message. I lie prejudice which is aroused frightens them into silence, if they have read the hooks, or into not reading them at all. If the territory has lieen worked thoroughly the books will have been left in the hands of more people, and more will have come to see whose representatives this class really are, 'Ilie people are more likely to come out with favorable comments which will help to break down the opposition. Each time around, the cyels of more find more are opened to the real issue. Kittle by little the prejudice is broken down until, finally, certain sections which were first considered as very iliflicult territory become fertile fields in which to sow the seeds of truth. When the workers get into a prejudiced section, they should try to remember that even though their success may he small this time, it is their privilege to i prepare the field for the next one who calls. When the work is thus considered, it becomes a real privilege to serve in this kind of territory as well as where the people listen to you gladly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Some of the friends have misunderstood the article which appeared in the October </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> regarding the pioneer colporteur requirements. Full time In the work Is still the requirement for pioneers; but the import of that article was that if one is unable to give nt least 25 hours a week to this work, then he would come under the auxiliary colporteur classification. By full time is meant that one is not dividing his time between secular employment and the Lord’s service. Those who desire to do this should enroll in the auxiliary branch of the service, as the pioneer service has been arranged to make it possl-blc for one to give his entire time in honoring the name of Jehovah. Of course, it is a privilege to give more than 25 hours in the canvass-tng; in fact, It would seem almost essential that one should do so if he desires to remain in this work. For those who can give their full time to the colporteur work but</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Some of the friends, in their zeal for tUe Kingdom, have failed to recognize the importance of carrying on their work in an orderly manner. They have picked up their bag of books, saying, ‘I guess I’ll call on the people of this town or rural section. 1 don’t believe any one lias ever been bore.’ They work the territory thoroughly, have a good time, and come home satisfied. The next week a colporteur who has been duly assigned to work that territory arrives, only to find that some one has just preceded him. The Society, acting upon the information at hand, has Informed him that the territory has not been worked for some time and is in need of the witness. Consequently he has made a long and expensive trip to get there, instead of to some other territory where there is no one to witness to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following is a sample of the letters we receive from time to time. A pioneer writes us, &quot;We find that this section was covered about two weeks ago, ami also about two months ago, as well as last spring, as stated on the assignment. The assignment also states that only the business section was covered last spring, whereas we find that everywhere we have been it 1ms been address to which you wish to have us address you. If you omit your local street address or post office box number, we presume that you wish to have books sent in care of general delivery. Some wonder why they don’t, hoar from us, and find later that letters and orders for books have been waiting tor them to call at the post office and depot, because of this omission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Where There Are Several Classes in the Same Assignment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To avoid confusion and needless reworking of territory where an English class and one and more classes speaking other languages are organized for service in the same assignment, it is necessary to so adjust the local territory that each organized clues may have a different, yet definite, assignment to work. The order of arrangement to be followed in such a ease is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All territory assignments are to be received through the English service director, the English-speaking director receiving his class assignment direct from the Society. It will be the duty of the English director to assign to each organized class in his territory assignment such territory as can be adequately covered by that class. Once the territory is so assigned to a class, the supervision and responsibility of seeing that it Is worked no longer rests upon the English director, but will then rest solely upon the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">covered. Brother------told US that</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">he had worked a part besides the business sections (to which he was assigned) and that lie hud worked one of the main roads from here. Brother and Sister ------ of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">-----class told us when we passed through there that they worked here in the summer, and w<sup>r</sup>e are also told that other workers were here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All, of course, rejoice In seeing so thorough a witness given, but how much better It would have been if the friends who desired to work in this territory hud first obtained assignment of it from this office and, upon its completion, had made a report to us as to just what had been done. Willi this information at hand, we should have been able to suggest, to this colporteur that, Instead of his making a long and expensive trip to this territory, he might spend his time, strength, and money to a better advantage in reaching a section of the country that had not been so recently, covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our correspondence indicates that some classes have not been observing their territory boundaries and. that some colporteurs have thought It is their privilege to work where-ever they please. Consequently, from time to time these misunderstandings aud confusions arise, sometimes resulting in a real hardship to colporteurs. If all the friends cooperate, a more thorough and orderly witness can be given throughout the eiHiro country. In the Interest of ihe Lord’s work as a whole, and your brother or sister in particular, let each worker be sure that he works in territory that has been duly -assigned by the Society or, If he lie with a clues, by the class service organization.</span></p>

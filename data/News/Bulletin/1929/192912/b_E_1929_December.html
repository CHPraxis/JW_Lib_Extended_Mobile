<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Half of This to Be Books, and Half Booklets</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">844,997 More Books than Were Placed Last Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Plan for the Year’s Work to Be Published Soon in Special </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We suppose you are all anxiously looking forward tn what the quota will be for the year 1930. The Lord has so wonderfully blessed last year’s work in the distribution of the books and booklets among the people of the earth that wc are convinced he will have his truth go forth this new year as never before. And so certain plans and arrangements are being made by the Society for the coming year, so that an even greater amount of literature may be distributer! to give the witness of the Kingdom. This is the biggest thing we have to do, and the Lord has blessed your efforts in taking this Kingdom message to the people, and he has greater blessings in store for you now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">First of all we will consider the quota for workers. Last year we had an average of 4,309 class workers in the field. Of course, this included the auxiliary colporteur workers, but as you know, during the coming year, the auxiliaries will report separately and so they will have a separate qnota. Taking into consideration that all the foreignspeaking classes are now included with the English-speaking workers, and including the sharpshooters, we believe we can keep our quota of workers for 1930 the same as for 1929, namely, 4,000 workers witnessing weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year we anticipate an increase in the auxiliary field. Last year, at its best, there were 732 brethren enrolled in the auxiliary branch of the work; but we helleve there are many more than tills who can find twelve hours a week to use In the house-to-house witnessing. This Is one field of the service which every one should investigate at this time, and It may be possible that you can so arrange your work that we can raise the mark for 1930 even above that for 1929. We are setting our quota, then, at 800 auxiliary colporteurs. We believe that by the Lord’s grace we can reach this quota, arid this field will be greatly vfliarged and the workers enriched with the Kingdom interests. It is the Lord who takes the talents (Kingdom interests) from the unfaithful and gives them to those who prove their devotion to him. We believe there are many in the classes who are given more talents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The average number of pioneer colporteurs enrolled during the past year was 1,132. The average number reporting was 834. We believe that, with a consistent effort on the part of those class workers who can see their way clear to engage in the pioneer work, we can set a quota of 1,200 pioneer colporteurs for 1930. There arc, no doubt, many of the auxiliary colporteurs who will be able to start in the pioneer work in early spring, and there are also many class workers and ex-ploneers who will want to be in the front ranks of the battle. Full-time service brings all-time joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This means, then, that we anticipate 4,000 class workers, 800 auxiliary colporteurs, and 1,200 pioneer colporteurs, or a total of 6,000 engaging tu the field service during the next year. Cau we do it? We’ll try.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now, how many books and booklets do you expect can lie placed by these 6,000 workers in the field? Our estimate is based upon the actual work done last year by the class workers; and by removing the auxiliaries and what they placed, we have arrived at the following conclusion. But before giving you these figures, we want to remind you that in a very short while the Society will be publishing a special </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hullciin</span><span class="font4"> tlmt will give you in detail the reasons and the argument why more books can be placed In the bonds of the people this coming ' year than last. This special </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font4">we hope to get ont during the month of December, and we believe that it ' will greatly rejoice the hearts of the anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At ihls time we want to show that the amount of books and booklets worked up in our quota is really possible for every one. First, we will consider the class workers. During this coming year we shall have seven books, as has been announced in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tote er,</span><span class="font4"> which will Include </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy.</span><span class="font4"> If each class worker places one seven-book combination a month, that will mean twelve combinations a year per worker, which is equal to 84 books. In addition to tiiese twelve combinations, each worker should be able to place four three-book combinations, equal to 12 books, five two-book combinations, equal to 10 books, and 85 single volumes during the year. Totaling this we find that it is equal to 191 cloth-bound books per worker a year. If we average our 4,006 workers throughout the year, this will mean 764,000 cloth-bound books. Putting our figures in round numbers, we set the quota at 750.000. In addition to the cloth-bound books, we have set a quota of 1,250,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Planning Your Work for the Winter</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6 Books for December and January</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Drive at the Ertfl of January</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the Lord's lightnings Illuminate the pathway of his anointed, it becomes more and more evident that the big, outstanding feature of the divine purposes is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the Kingdom, </span><span class="font4">through which the mime of Jehovah will be exalted and his purposes for ever established In the minds and hearts of all his creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was a time when we thought all house-to-house witnessing was limited to colporteurs. Gradually we came to appreciate that the pouring-out of his spirit upon all flesh meant that all of God’s anointed were to be his witnesses. Then, as classes, we gradually organized for service; but our activities were limited to the summer months in the North, West, aud East, and to the winter in the South during the early part of the year. Now tile importance of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the Kingdom </span><span class="font4">and of the commission which we have received makes it very evident that seasonal activity alone will not merit the Lord’s approval. Undoubtedly, weather conditions make it harder in the North in the winter, and in the South in the summer; but if the honor of God’s name and the establishment of his Kingdom is not of such paramount importance in our estimation as to induce us to inconvenience ourselves a whole lot, we do not have the proper perspective of our commission. It has been truly said, “What costs nothing manifests nothing.&quot; Wintry and rainy weather has its advantages too, in that it keeps the people at home and we gain an entrance into homes; which is very important in our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In all sections of the country those engaged In worldly pursuits have to keep going twelve months a year. Surely the honor of our God and his kingdom is of more importance than any world pursuit could possibly lie. Jesus said, “Seek yc FIRST the kingdom of God and his righteousness.” Therefore instead of ceasing activity from December 1 or 15 until April 15 or May I, as has been the habit of almost fifty percent of the class workers and a large number of colporteurs, let each one carefully plan his winter’s work so that each class worker will have at least four hours a week for the Kingdom witness and the honor of Jehovah’s name. There is plenty of territory in the cities for colporteurs and class workers, where street car service or buses are always available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service committee must take the lead in the winter campaign by carefully analyzing the territory and picking out such portions as can be worked with the least inconvenience during the winter. Apartment houses, apartments over stores, business sections, and homes where there are protective porches and vestibules: all of these places can be worked to an advantage In any kind of weather. Discuss the problems freely in the service meetings. All wisdom does not necessarily reside In the service committee, and the other workers who are continually faced with these problems should be given an opportunity to recommend ways and means for solving them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Plan your territory for the six-book (Jr) campaign during the month of December and tlie first twenty-four days of January.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> drive should be very carefully arranged for and planned. The territory to be canvassed for this book should be portions where good results were obtained with the six-book combination, All who have the six books will want to complete their set. Those who could not afford to take the set will be glad to avail themselves of one book. Do not, at this time, undertake canvassing in territory with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> which has not been thoroughly worked with the six-book combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The part of the country in which you are located, and the general weather conditions, will naturally afieet your choice of territory, and our intention in making the above suggestions is not to hinder, but rather to call attention to certain points which should help in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> drive and prepare for the subsequent winter campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ADVANTAGES OF WINTEB CANVASSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the summer the spare moments arc spent out In the car, on the golf links, nt the seaside, or out in some nearby park. The people do not stay indoors any more than they find necessary. They are not particularly interested in things which are not closely associated with their business or pleasure. Therefore many people you canvass in the summer are not In a mood to accept your message, because they can not at the moment see how they can apply themselves to its study. In the winter, however, In the major por-</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Public Offer to Begin January 25</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">“What? Another new book?” “When shall wo get it?” “How soon can we add it to our six-book combination and offer it to tlie people?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Haven’t you been Just “bustin’ ” with curiosity to see what more good things the Lord Ims for you in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy?</span><span class="font4"> We should like to tell you all about It, but we aren’t going to spoil the surprise. “What’s its color?” “What’s it all about?” Well, you just wait and see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A consignment of the author's edition is being sent to all the classes so that each worker can drink in the good things first and get ready for the future campaign. Auxiliary colporteurs also cun obtain their copy from their class; or in case they are not with a class they can order their copies direct from the Society. These copies of the author's edition are 50c each to everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But these copies of tho first edition are not to be used for general canvassing. The field work with the new book does not begin until January 25, and then throughout the country nine days are to be set aside in order to Introduce It to the public. At that time tlie amount will be 45 L From January 25 to February 2 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> will be the big feature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to make that week a success nil the classes and colporteurs will be anxious to cooperate. Accordingly, consignments are being made of a supply of these new books to those classes whose accounts are in good condition and whose reports warrant it. A notice will be sent to the class if they are included in this consignment list. If they are not, then the number of books desired should be ordered by the class in the usual manner, direct from the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Auxiliary and pioneer colporteurs will not be sent special consignments of this book, but should place their own orders. The Chicago and St. Louis de]tots will have the books in stock after December 15, and tlie Oakland depot about January 1, But remember, if you order your stock early, it is to be understood that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> is not to be offered to the public before January 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The manner in which the I,ord blessed those who followed previous outlined campaigns is a testimonial tliut his favor is npon those who seek to carry on his work in his way. We feel confident that those who truly love him will rejoice to have this new book to offer the people, to wait until his appointed time, and then to enter into this work with the same zeal and spirit that Is so peculiar to his people. Remember the dates: January 25 to February 2. Have your stock on hand, so as to bo ready to go forth into the field on Sunday, January 25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">And now, can the auxiliary colporteurs distribute 275.000 clothbound books? Due to the fact that we do not have 800 auxiliaries now, we base onr estimate on the average throughout the year, that is, 600 workers. If each auxiliary colporteur places 33 seven-book combinations during the year, which will equal 231 books; 12 three-book combinations a year, equal to 36 books; 16 two-book combinations, or 32 books; aud 160 single bound books, that will make a total of 459 cloth-bound books a year for each auxiliary. An average of 600 reporting would make It 275,400 cloth-bound books for the year. If Hie friends engage in the auxiliary branch of the service and begin early, and we reach our quota of 800 auxiliaries, It would be very easy to reach this^ool; quota. In addition, we hope that the auxiliaries will place 250.000 booklets. Tlie </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">booklet</span><span class="font4"> quota will include </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4"> booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the pioneers we have set a quota of 1,725,000 bound books. In order for the pioneers to accomplish this, It will be necessary for each one to place 150 seven-book combinations, 44 th ree-book combinations, 90 two-book combinations, and 375 single books; a total of 1,737</span></p>

Believing that toward the end of the year we shall have engaged in the pioneer work 1,200 brethren, wc believe a conservative average is 1,000 workers reporting weekly. In addition, we hope the pioneers will place 1,250,000 booklets of all kinds. If the classes, the auxiliaries, and the pioneers see the necessity of reporting every week throughout the year, it will help greatly in bringing about this quota, which brings much encouragement and joy to tire friends scattered throughout the whole country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The winter is a wonderful time for finding the people at home, and being invited into their homes on account of inclement weather outside. Why not take advantage of this situation instead of “hibernating” like an old bear for the winter time?</span></p>

The people have long winter evenings and Sundays at home. In farming sections there is very little to do except chores and wood-cutting. All the people hnve much more time on their hands than in the summer. They want to spend this time as profitably and enjoyably as possible. You have the best and the only thing that will fulfil thc-ir desire, the message of God’s Kingdom. It Is going to lie a little inconvenient for you to bring It to them.

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Glad to See so Many Class Workers in the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BOOKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have just completed comparing your October and November sales and are very glad to tell you that the results are most gratifying. Your quota of bound books was 95, 000 for the months of October and November. The sales during that period were 96,091, or 1,091 books above the quota. We do not mind admitting now that when this quota was set we were apprehensive that, because of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font4"> campaign, you would not be able to make it. But, in order to attain the objective for the year, it was necessary to set this quota. It is therefore doubly gratifying to us, and wo know it will be to you also, to find that you not only made your quota but exceeded It by over one thousand books. This is unquestionably the Lord’s blessing upon the efforts put forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BOOKLETS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The booklet quota did not show up as favorably as that of the bound books. However, this Is no cause for discouragement. In fact, we are convinced that by the time the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font4"> campaign is finished you will more than make up the 11,500 which you were short during October and November. The quota for booklets was 105,000, and the sales for the two months were 93,492. However, It should be kept in mind that we are this amount short of our monthly quota. Therefore we recommend that each class make note of this fact and put forth an extra effort to bring your booklet sales up to the monthly quota In order that you may be assured that by the end of the year the yearly quota will be reached. Of course it is not the intention to make up this shortage on booklets by diverting the campaign from the bound books or five-cent booklet while these campaigns are on, but, rather, that the workers should add one or more booklets to their present combination and thus increase the sale of the booklets to bring it up to the required amount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last, but by no means least of our news for you in this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin, </span><span class="font4">is that you have more than maintained your quota of workers in the field during the months of October and November. As you know, the qnota was an average of 4,000 workers each week. During October the weekly average number of workers was 4,734, and for November it was 4,844. That is what being God’s witnesses really means: consistent regularity in the work that the Lord has given us to do. We are convinced that this figure ot‘ 4,700 and 4,800 workers con be maintained throughout the year. We believe that each one of you brethren In </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the field appreciates as we do here</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for Book Combination</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For twenty consecutive days the singers in the Lord’s army will shout forth the glad song of praise to Jehovah contained in the booklet, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend.</span><span class="font4"> The last great shout in November resulted in many of the classes’ selling their entire stock of booklets, but we have plenty of ammunition left. If the class stock Is low, the service committee should at once order enough to cover all the homes in the class territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Remember, the drive for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font4"> Is to be for twenty days ONLY. Then all start the work with the bound books by re-canvassing the territory just worked for the booklets, as outlined In the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin of</span><span class="font4"> December 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CLASS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wo would not want this occasion to pass without commending you on the last </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font4"> drive. There were approximately 1,000,000 copies of this booklet placed in the hands of tbe people by the classes during the October-November drive. There were on an average 4,844 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">workers</span><span class="font4"> participating in this drive, selling an average of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">SOO booklets </span><span class="font4">each. Nothing but the spirit of Jehovah actuating the workers could have accomplished so mighty a witness in so short a period of time. In fact, when the report was compiled at the office we felt like tbe psalmist of old who said, “This is the I Lord’s doing; It Is marvellous In our eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The January drive with this booklet will, last five days longer than the drive during October and November. It will undoubtedly result in another million of these booklets’ being placed In the hands of the people. In order to accomplish this, let each worker set for himself the minimum quota of 200 booklets for tlie drive. We are sure that as the Lord blessed the efforts put forth in the last witness he will also bless your efforts in this drive, if you, as individuals, put forth a reasonable effort to reach the objective. In tbe March </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> we shall give you the results of this drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Avoid Frequent Changes of Address</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Colporteurs who are working pioneer territory are asked to select a central point at which they can collect their mall, In order to avoid too frequent changes of address. By planning your work so that you will not have to change your address more than twice a month at the most, you will not have the difficulty of lost mall, paying extra forwarding charges, etc, Whenever it is necessary to make a change, please remember to notify the Colporteur Department In advance on the regular change of address slip.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Biggest Eight Weeks Ever Had by Pioneers Surpasses</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Previous Peak by 26,669</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first returns for the big campaign for October and November are now ready. Regular colporteurs, you placed 181,447 books and 119,679 104 booklets. Auxiliary colporteurs, you sold 22,066 books and 16,054 10&lt; booklets. Isn’t that great for a starter? We think so, and it makes us very happy. But don't get puffed up over it; for in order to make the final quota you'll have to do even better than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having proportioned the work which should be done monthly, we find that the regulars were short 5,553 books and 80,321 booklets, and tbe auxiliaries were short 4,034 books and 16,054 booklets. That sounds like a lot, doesn’t it? To those who have been working hard, as we know some have, it might be a hit discouraging; but It should not be, for we are confident that when the rest who have been a little lax hear of this, they will get busy and report regularly. Of course some have been sick and unahle to work, but it helps a lot if you let us know about it by sending in your report just the same. Some have done this right along, and we want you to know that It is appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now for a few more figures. The results show that Instead of 1,885 colporteurs reporting regularly each week, as were enrolled during November, we beard from an average of only 1,062. And, would you believe it? 502 didn’t so much as to send us one report. The regulars who did report averaged only 17.7 hours a week in the actual canvassing; and the auxiliaries, only 7,8 hours a week, instead of the 10 hours agreed upon. So you see there's plenty of room for Improvement. If everybody had been on their toes, what would have happened to that two months’ quota? You would have passed It so far that you wouldn’t know that it existed. But now it means full speed ahead In order to make up for lost time. The greatest work ever is now under way, and it is your privilege to huve part in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the necessity of giving an effective witness to the glory of the Lord at this time. However, there is one thing that we should like to call to the attention of a number of service directors, and that is the fact that 161 classes in the United States did not report during the months of October and November. If these had reported, undoubtedly the qnota figures shown above wonfd have heen greatly increased and even more encouraging. IVe therefore earnestly request all sendee directors to cooperate with ns in maintaining accurate records by report</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ing regularly, every week.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Colporteurs’ Part in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Drive</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course all the colporteurs want to have some part in putting out </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples’ Friend,</span><span class="font4"> hut not all can afford to give their full time to this during the special drive periods. We suggest, therefore, that you offer one of the booklets with each sale. If you have an assignment of I winter pioneer territory with some class and the class Intends to cover your territory with this booklet, then you need not include it in your combination. If you cooperate with the local service director you will know just what to do. But if you have territory which the class is un-ablo to cover with the booklet, then it will bo well for you to include one with each sale and to offer it at each call you make, even though the drive may not be on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some one asks, “What about those who are working pioneer territory where there is no class?” If you have such an assignment you may follow the same practice or spend a day or two a week in canvassing part of your territory for the booklet exclusively. Then a few weeks later in this same territory try a recan vass with the bound books. We shall be Interested In hearing from you as to the success of the latter plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Restoration Consignment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early In January we shall forward a consignment of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Restoration </span><span class="font4">books to all classes. This book will be charged on the class account at seven cents and sold to the public at ten cents. It can also be Included In combinations with two other ten-eent booklets at three for twenty-five cents. This will undoubtedly prove to be a most attractive addition to the booklet assortment and should be a big factor in encouraging the sale of book-and-booklet combinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Colporteurs Asked Not to Use Class Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Colporteurs are requested to order their books direct from the Society Instead of drawing on class stock and requesting us to make a transfer entry on our accounts. This has caused a great deal of confusion in our records. Only in case of special emergency or when special permission has been granted by this office should this be done. If you ruu short, borrow from the class and replace the books when your new supply arrives. The only exception to this Is in the case of auxiliary colporteurs working with the 54 booklets. Since the auxiliary and class rates on these are the same, the auxiliaries should buy them direct from the class. Please </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">do not request that a transfer en</span><span class="font4">try be made, however.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Three Classes of People That Have the Means to Buy But Are Not Often Reached</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Travelers, Hotel Employes, Small Merchants</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the months of January and February, and in some localities most of March, there is a great Influx of winter tourists to Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, Texas and southern California, with Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama getting tiicir share. These people are, as a rule, not the extremely rich, looking for pleasure, but the moderately well-off class who can not endure the rigorous northern winter. They are an Intelligent class of thinking people who have had to earn whatever little of this world’s goods they have. Away from home, they will have time on their hands to think and read. If they can be approached with the proper literature, they will undoubtedly respond. During January, February and March a concentrated effort should be made to reach tills class. The majority of them will be found in hotels and select boarding-houses, difficult to reach by the ordinary canvasser. Therefore it will require very careful planning on the part of the service committee to reach them. In this planning we shall not be able to give you much help, because the local conditions vary greatly. However, qualified brethren who are good mixers and capable of meeting the hotel employes and guests on equal terms should be chosen for</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ClassWorkers’Books</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Three Hours a Week Designates One as a Worker</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Books are shipped to the classes on consignment and charged to the class at class rates. Every member of the class engaging in the service an average of three hours a week, and so reporting to the local service director, shall be entitled to receive books at the price at which the Society bills to the class, to wit, the class rates shown on the price-list. All profits between the prices abovementioned and the established retail selling price belongs to the worker, and it will be his privilege to contribute It to whatsoever fund in the class he may desire, or otherwise dispose of It as he may see fit. If the workers themselves enter into an agreement among themselves that they will set aside and contribute to the service fund so I many cents from each sale, that I win be their privilege, but it should be done by consent and not by compulsion. All who are not workers within the meaning of the above statement should be required to pay the full retail price to the class, and the class may do with the funds what it wants to and however it pleases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Marking Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a strong objection to stamping local addresses in the literature that we sell to the public. Therefore Brother Rutherford bus</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">ruled that &quot;the local address is not carefully pocked, securely tied, and to be stamped in any literature sold \ plainly addressed with your full after the receipt of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin&quot;,</span><span class="font4"> ; name arid address, as well as that with the exception, of course, of of the Society. Such Information such pieces of literature as you should appear on all correspondence have already stamped. If the nd- to this office also.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4">this work, so that, in case It is not. practicable to canvass the guests direct, some arrangement might be</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">made with the manager or room clerk to place some of the ‘question leaflets' in a neatly-addressed envelope in their mail-boxes. Or another suggestion: In most of these resort towns the local newspaper carries a list of “Hotel Guest Arrivals”. These could be watched closely and the ‘question leaflets’ mailed to them. However, it is much more effective to canvass the people direct ; and where this is possible, do not resort to the mailing plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another class of people found in these localities at the same seasons, and who should not he neglected, are the hotel employes. These aro a class who work at the northern seashore and mountain resorts during the summer and go south In the winter. They travel a great deal and are, as a rule, broadminded. Some of these are colored, others white; but as a rule they have separate . quarters and can be reached between three and four in the afternoon and between seven and nine in the evening, according to their employment. It will require careful planning to reach these people, also. I The service committee should ascertain all the facts arid conditions regarding all the resorts In the class territory, and lay plans accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The third class in this section who should be considered in this campaign are the small merchants (in curio shops, soft drink places, restaurants, garages and filling stations), in fact, all who cater to tourist trade. These should be can-: vassed in the forenoon, preferably Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, vice in the “Organization Method” has been follower! closely in this connection, this should not amount to a great deal. Kindly observe this rule in all literature distributed.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">$1.00 Bibles Aid Sale of Books Now in Stock</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One brother writes us, “I find that to mention, ‘I have a good Bible for those who do not have one,’ makes the people in this rural mountain district feel more appreciative of the other hooks and has I enabled me to make a few sales of the five books, also combinations with a No. 218 Bible for S2.98, where I do not believe any sale conld have been made withont a Bible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What is trne of him might also apply to other workers. These $l.t)0 Bibles, No. 218, are now in stock; and if any of the colporteurs or (■lasses desire them, they can get them by sending their orders direct to this office. They are not being handled by the depots.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Better Way to Encourage Radio Stations</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Letters of appreciation sent to radio stations by individuals are of doubtful value, sometimes because of poor writing, poor spelling or poor grammar, and because the station owners recognize the fact that such letters are urged. We here suggest a method of enconragcment whereby one letter may be fur more effective than scores or hundreds. It is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let all canvassers mention WATCH TOWER PROGRAMS and the nearest station broadcasting the same and ask about the reception of these programs. Jot down the Information in a note-hook, and reporl the same at the one- and two-day LOCAL SERVICE CONVENTIONS that are now being held all over the country. Some good stenographer or penman should take down these reports and formulate a well-written, typed letter which should be sent to the station proprietors. The letter should embody the following points, viz,:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1) That a convention of Bible Students was held, giving the name of the city.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) That reports on reception of WATCH TOWER PROGRAMS from this particular station were I requested.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">i (3) The cities and towns that re-<sup>1</sup> port good reception should be mentioned, with other items of interest.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(4) Mention the fact that the | delegates call upon the people in I their homes, offering them Bible study helps and always introducing themselves by identifying their work with the WATCH TOWER PROGRAMS.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">(5} Conclude the letter with an expression of thanks for the cooperation of the station in making our programs a success.</span></p>

<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Pays Fine With Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A colporteur writes us from California that the other day he was “pinched” by a &quot;speed cop” for having glaring headlights. He was j brought before the Justice of the j peace and lined five dollars. But in the course of the proceedings he began to tell the judge about the truth. The latter in turn look him into his confidence and related how his wife had died just the previous week and i how distressed he was over eondi-l tions in general. For a half an hour the brother talked with him, and writes us, “We had the balm of Gilead. He wanted the comforting message. Tomorrow we pay our fine with a set of Jndge Rutherford’s five books and five booklets arid also a set of seven volumes of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures.</span><span class="font4"> ‘God works in a mysterious way his wonders to per- j form.' ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Use 12 Book Combination</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Volume combination drive Is well on the way in class territory, and by using </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font4"> as the keybook it is going strong. The election issues are still fresh in the minds of the people. Many people think that opportunity for good government was lost with the defeat of Governor Smith. Others voted for Mr. Hoover and are wondering whether it will result in good government or not; and there are still others who have read </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples P'riend</span><span class="font4"> booklet who are wondering about the failure of all human methods of government, as suggested therein. Undoubtedly many people who favored Governor Smith for president feel that they were discriminated against because of a bigoted attitude on the part of many people. To such it may be stressed that, the publications of the Society are broadminded and imsectarian and without bigotry and show no favoritism. A colporteur writes, &quot;The Catholics, after election, are good for the truth, and today I sold one such whose faith was wavering.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another sister recommends the twelve-hook combination, which comprises the seven volumes of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies </span><span class="font4">and the five later books, to those who are interested or to those who have read some of the later books and want to Investigate further. This combination at $4.48 is most | desirable and should be recommended whenever possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Sold by U. S, Post Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Great Help in Covering Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you want to cover your rural territory thoroughly^ which of course you do, we suggest that you get a rural map of the territory assigned to you. Go to your local post office and ask for permission to look on pages 88 and 89 of the 1928 U. S. Postal Guide. There yon will find a list of counties for which maps can be obtained, together with the following instructions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Maps showing rural-delivery service in the counties listed below have been completed and negative prints can be furnished at 50 cents per copy. These maps are drawn, generally, on a scale of 1 mile to the inch. Rural routes for counties not. listed are shown on local center maps which can be purchased for 75 cents for all routes from each office. Purchasers must make application and payment for the maps to the ‘Disbursing Clerk, Post Office Department, Washington, D. C.‘ All remittances should be by postal money order. Postage stamps not accepted in payment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These are excellent maps, as they show not only the routes but also the number of homes and their locations along each route.</span></p>

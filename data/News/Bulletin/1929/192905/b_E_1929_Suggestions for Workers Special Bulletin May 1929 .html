<p><span class="font4">May-1929</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">TO ALL WORKERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fellow-Witnesses:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Once again we have the pleasure of passing on to you, in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Special Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> some information which we trust will assist you in making a more efficient witness for Jehovah and his glorious kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We sincerely believe that those to whom the Lord will entrust the wonderful privilege of ‘showing forth the exceeding riches of his grace in the ages to come’ will be such faithful, loyal witnesses who, while on earth, made His business their principal business, just as Jesus did. They not only will take advantage of every opportunity to spend their time and strength in his service, but will also give thought and make serious efforts to become as efficient witnesses as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The important things absolutely necessary for successful witnessing are faith, loyalty and obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One must really believe that he has the truth, and, having entered into a covenant with the Lord, he must continue, in the resolute conviction that, in his knowledge of the divine plan and in the literature from which it was obtained, he has God’s grandest gift to any human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Loyalty and obedience will lead the truly consecrated son of God to make his Father’s business his main business. If unable, on account of necessity of providing for Scriptural dependents, to spend his entire time in the Lord’s service, he will plan to devote as many months of the year, or weeks, or days, or hours a day, as possible in proclaiming the glad tidings of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And then, in your witness work, learn to appreciate the fact that in the literature you are distributing you have something far more important to the people than anything else in the whole world. What does the price of a meal, or a necktie, or a dress, or anything else they usually buy amount to compared with the knowledge of God’s glorious kingdom and its everlasting blessings to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Please be assured, dear brethren, that we are right with you to assist in any way we can, and remember that every day here at Bethel we ask the Lord to bless you in your work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brethren in Christ,</span></p><img src="b_E_1929_Suggestions for Workers Special Bulletin May 1929 _files/b_E_1929_Suggestions for Workers Special Bulletin May 1929 -1.png" alt="" style="width:209pt;height:36pt;">

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Special Bulletin</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">May-1929</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord’s people are realizing as never before that, in their covenant relationship with him, they have been organized in the earth to do a specific work. True Christians are described as a peculiar people. (1 Pet. 2:9) A more exact translation renders it, “a people for a purpose.” That purpose is clearly stated in God’s Word. When Jesus was arraigned before Pilate he stated the purpose of his being in the world when he answered, “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.” (John 18:37) His business was to bear to the world the truth pertaining to the great name of Jehovah God and his everlasting Kingdom. This is likewise the main business of the true Christian at the present time. Every issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> brings to our attention scriptures to prove this. The object of this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font2"> is to suggest different methods of presenting the Kingdom message to the people and to aid the Lord’s anointed to become more efficient representatives of that Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All realize that the only really lasting witness is made by placing the books in the hands of the people. To accomplish this witness it is necessary to take into consideration the fundamental principles of effective demonstration. As advance agents representing the reigning King, God’s witnesses are really presenting to the people an opportunity for a perpetual inheritance in God’s everlasting Kingdom. The books that we place in their hands could be considered a prospectus telling them of the beauties of the Kingdom and how they should conduct themselves in order to be in line for its blessings. The cardinal principles in effective witnessing are as set forth below. -</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1) Appearance and Presentation</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">First impressions are lasting; if unfavorable, they are hard to overcome. Going from house to house witnessing for the Kingdom demands a neat and clean appearance. As representatives of a reigning King we must comply with this rule in order to be efficient. It is not necessary, however, to have new clothes in order to be successful; but it is necessary that one’s clothes be clean and have the appearance of care. Likewise the shoes should be kept in good order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To be successful in carrying the Kingdom message, it is advisable to bring oneself to the level of the prospective customer. In rural sections one’s appearance should be that of a rural resident rather than that of a “city slicker” out. to “do” country people. When working in the factory or poorer districts, the point of* view should be that of people who reside in these districts, so as to be considered as one of them; that is, the Lord’s witness should be “all things to all men” if thus some may be won to Christ. Thus one creates the impression that he understands their difficulties and can sympathize with them. In both of the above instances fur coats and “high hats” would be decidedly out of place. When working in the elite or best residential districts procure, if possible, the names and addresses of the people to be interviewed. This information can generally be obtained from a city directory. One will then know for whom to ask specifically, when calling at the door. It is well to have calling cards engraved, like those used in the best of society; also a “professional-looking” bag, or ladies’ demonstration bag, as described later herein. Finally, an air of dignity and courtesy is essential: these people are used to this, and the visit is of great importance. It is advisable that the directors in the larger classes choose workers who are suitable for such work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The books should be presented in such a manner that the prospect can understand just what is being demonstrated. They should be so held that they face the prospect and that he can actually see what they contain. This means that the witness will have to cultivate the art of reading upside down. Before the books are taken out they should be carefully prepared so that the worker will always know which one is going to be demonstrated next. A good witness is so familiar with his goods that he never needs to look down from his prospect to find anything. Instruction in the preparation of the books will be found later on in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The appearance of the books being offered is another important consideration. Many sales have been lost because the books demonstrated are spotted and soiled. To overcome this, some brethren have a set specially prepared for demonstration purposes and always leave a bright new combination with the purchaser. The following contribution may be helpful: “As a suggestion to those who have difficulty in keeping the covers of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font2"> clean: We paint our sample book with a thin coat of white shellac. It can then be used as a demonstrator for weeks without soiling the backs. Art gum can be used to clean finger-prints, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">White shellac, French or any other artist’s varnish is obtainable in almost any paint or artists’ supply stores. Should the shellac become too thick to spread easily, it may be thinned to the proper consistency with denatured alcohol. To do a really neat job, it is suggested that, instead of applying the shellac or varnish with a paint brush, an atomizer or artist’s fixator be used. An atomizer can be bought at any drug store. By spraying it on the books all streaks are avoided and a smooth, evenly-colored surface results. When the cover has dried, any dirt spots may be easily removed by using a damp cloth. Since water now will not spot the book, one is prepared to go out rain or shine without fear of having the books used for demonstrating spoiled by water-spots. By coating one of each of the cloth-bound books in this manner, one is able always to demonstrate with clean books and leave a bright new set with the one purchasing, taking it from the bag after the sale has been made.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) Interest</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In arousing interest an up-to-date canvass must be used, with current events introduced that will be of interest to the prospect. A 1914 canvass that has been carefully memorized and repeated until it is thread-bare should not be expected to bring satisfactory results. A canvass, at best, is never very interesting. Therefore it is preferable to demonstrate to the prospect exactly what one has and how its use will be to his advantage. The rurals and the poorer sections are naturally interested in such things as the reason for so much unemployment, the high taxes, the exorbitant prices of food and clothing, the injustice to the farmer and the working people at the hands of the profiteers and politicians, the prospects of a real government for the people, etc. In the better residential districts, where professional and business men reside, it will be found that they are interested in such things as the prospects of a wave of prosperity and increased business activities. In the rich districts they are interested in the fluctuations of the stock market, the present relation of the United States with other nations and the increase of commerce, the advance of civilization due to commerce and business, and the prospects of another world war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before a sale can be made the interest of the prospect must be aroused. Therefore it is well to inject into the canvass something of peculiar interest to the person being interviewed. If there has been no interest aroused one can hardly expect a prospect to purchase. Therefore interest must be aroused before a witness can be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this connection, a colporteur who has remained in the work for many years writes: “When I began work as a colporteur sixteen years ago, the clergy were respected. In those days we had to be &quot;as mum as an oyster’, or thought we had to be, about the clergy, if we would sell books. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">How different it all is now! </span><span class="font2">One of my most successful broadsides against the clergy and for placing the books is, T am a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minister of the gospel;</span><span class="font2"> and my work is to share this gospel or good news with the people, FREE. Jesus never sent out any one to wear a long-tailed coat and collect the people’s money on Sunday morning or any other morning. He said when sending out his disciples to preach, “Freely ye have received, freely GIVE.” We don’t want you to give us a cent for the good things in these books. They are like the air and sunshine provided by the Lord. And we want every one to have these good books who is willing to pay us the bare cost of materials and handling, so that we can print another set and deliver to some one else.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“It seems quite edifying and very agreeable to the people to call their attention to the fact that we wear no long-tailed black coats or clerical collars, and that we beg no money, because these are no part of Christianity; that John the Baptist was declared by Jesus to have been one of the greatest of the prophets, and yet wore plain clothes; that we are not asking the people to donate to the crease in our trousers or the polish on our shoes; we are busy with something more important.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Many will agree that it is passing strange that if a man works on Sunday to make a living, he goes to hell; but that if a preacher loafs all week, and works his mouth some on Sunday, and takes in more than the other man did in his seven days of toil, then he, the preacher, goes to heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One witness calling upon a man to whom he had previously talked used the following method to awaken his interest. He asked him what he thought of President Hoover’s remarks, in his address on the day he took office, to the effect that ‘the world is at peace’. The man sneered at it and said that he did not think so. He added that he had no faith in the Kellogg Pact. This enabled the witness to reawaken the man’s interest in the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He adopted a similar plan in the same territory when he noticed, hanging in nearly every home, the preelection poster of Hoover. He questioned the people about Hoover’s words concerning the world’s being at peace, and thus opened the way for the presentation of the truth. At one home, where he was invited to come in, he sat down and picked up a newspaper. Across the top there was a scare-heading about the Mexican revolution. He then made the remark, “President Hoover said that the world is at peace, but this hardly indicates that.” Then he added, “This reminds me of the words in the Bible, that ‘they shall say peace, peace, when there is no peace’.” In this manner interest was awakened in the literature, although the people were destitute and said they could not afford to buy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(3) Inquisitiveness</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Why inquisitiveness? When the prospect begins to ask questions it is an indication that he is becoming interested in the proposition. If the question is asked, “What is the soul?” or, “Where are the dead?” or, “Where did Cain get his wife?” one should always refer them to the books, stating that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Harp</span><span class="font2"> covers this question’, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘Creation</span><span class="font2"> covers that question’, and demonstrating how easily the information may be found. The result will be that if the witness really aroused their interest, people will purchase the books in order to satisfy their desire for more information. If all their questions are answered they will then not feel the need of purchasing the books to find out something they already know. Sometimes the question is asked, “Are these Catholic books?” One should always answer such a question by asking a related question. A good reply to this question would be, “Are you a Catholic?” Their answer will enable the witness to continue the canvass along a line that will not cause antagonism.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(4) Desire to Purchase</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Create a desire to purchase. Practically every sale that is made is due to just one thing, namely, the witness’ ability to show the customer that he actually needs the books. Thereforeagoodwitness will continually, throughout his canvass, suggest to his prospects their need of the books. This suggestion should be woven into the canvass without the prospects’ being aware of it; for, generally, the moment one tries to make others believe that he knows better what they need than they themselves do, they are going to resent it. Therefore this should be very carefully developed. Another point: It is never proper to disparage another person’s goods in order to place one’s own. Rather, the prospect is to be shown that he needs these goods as much as and even more than he needed the other’s. For example: If when calling at a home they say, “We paid ten dollars the other day for a book on the Bible by the Adventists,” it is not well, in such instance, to discredit the Adventists even though one knows they are wrong, and their charges excessive. In “running down” another, one in that moment defeats his own object from two standpoints. First, such an attitude implies that the prospect was foolish in purchasing the ten-dollar book, and no one likes to be called a fool. Second, it will give him the impression that the witness is intolerant toward other beliefs and teachings which are not in harmony with his own. Religious intolerance is objectionable to most people, and in the majority of cases they will resent such an attitude. Therefore, instead of trying to discredit the Adventists’ literature, one should approach the prospect something like this: “No doubt you have secured a very beautiful book which contains many interesting and instructive points and which will give you an answer to some questions. But that which I have here is entirely different from anything that can be obtained in the market. These books are not sectarian and are being enjoyed by people of all creeds and denominations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Every one recognizes that this is an age of specialization. If one wants to make a success of anything, he has to make it his big thing in life. Judge Rutherford, in his study of the Bible, has found that every book of the Bible centers around the one great theme of God’s promise to bless all the families of the earth by setting up his kingdom upon the earth. Unless this great purpose of God is properly understood, the Bible is a mystery and becomes as so many claim it to be, ‘a fiddle upon which any tune can be played? You have often heard that expression, haven’t you? And how many times you hear people say, 'Oh, you can prove anything by the Bible? But as a man of reason, you will admit that if the Bible is God’s Word, there must be one true interpretation. Wouldn’t it be but reasonable to believe that the correct one would be harmonious throughout and not contradict itself?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From here one can then continue with the canvass, bringing in certain questions and showing how they are answered by the books, such as the following: What is the cause of so many different languages in the world today? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Deliverance,</span><span class="font2"> 53:1) Who has the keys to hell? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Deliverance,</span><span class="font2"> 170:1) What is the sin against the holy spirit? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Deliverance,</span><span class="font2"> 150: 2) Who were the morning stars that sang together at the creation of the earth? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Creation,</span><span class="font2"> 24:2) When will the great battle of Armageddon begin? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Creation,</span><span class="font2"> 38:2) Demonstrate how clearly and simply these and thousands of similar questions can be answered by means of the different books. Stress should always be laid on the Kingdom message as the particularly distinctive feature of that which is being offered. The points suggested by the witness, under the preceding heading, concerning the message’s being free, might also be used in this connection with good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Always work through the positive, and never through the negative; for one can prove a positive, but can not prove a negative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In closing a sale, conclude the canvass something like this: 'We are placing all these five books in your hands for only one-ninety-eight, because we know that they will be an advantage to you and at that price practically everybody can afford them? Never close in this manner: 'Don’t you want these books for only one dollar and ninety-eight cents ?’ That will automatically suggest to the other’s mind the negative answer, &quot;No, I do not want those books.” Always say &quot;one-ninety-eight”, &quot;only a quarter,” &quot;just a dime,” instead of saying &quot;one dollar and ninety-eight cents”, &quot;twenty-five cents” or &quot;ten cents”. The former does not sound as large as the latter.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(5) Selling What Is Needed</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Present a beautiful picture. When they were putting on the large real estate boom in Florida, one of the first things the realtor would do was to hire an artist to paint a picture of the finished subdivision, with all its fancied beauties. The salesman would become very familiar with this picture and then go out and sell the picture in the back of his head to the buyer, instead of selling the sandy-palmetto-scrub land. He knew that people will buy beautiful things. Nobody wants ugly things. The Kingdom of God will be indescribably beautiful and everlasting in duration. This wonderful Kingdom is pictured in his Word and reproduced in the books. Therefore every representative of the Kingdom should get the &quot;vision” clearly in mind and then present the Kingdom to the people from that standpoint. He must have in his mind a very vivid picture of the Kingdom in order to describe its beauties to the people. Anybody will buy blessings. Nobody wants to buy curses. For example: There were two witnesses in the work. One was selling; the other was not. The one who was selling went with the other to see how he was presenting the books. This is what took place. When the prospect came to the door he raised his hat and said, &quot;I have come to tell you about the great time of trouble that is coming.” Before he could say any more the woman replied, &quot;Man alive! I have all the trouble I want, without hearing of more to come.” Slam went the door. The woman had all the trouble she could carry, and the witness tried to sell her some more instead of offering her the blessings and beauties of the Kingdom. The people want comforts and blessings; so go out and sell them the books, showing them how the books will bring to them peace of mind through a knowledge of coming blessings.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(6) Books Out of Sight</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Keep books out of sight. The first impressions that are made are usually lasting, and therefore they should be favorable. If the prospect sees a bag of books, his mind at once becomes set on the fact that he is dealing with a book agent. This makes a poor first impression, and it will have to be set aside before any progress can be made. A false impression is hard to remove, and frequently can not be removed at all. There are two simple ways to keep the books out of sight.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(a) For a man.</span><span class="font2"> A book can be placed in each side pocket of the coat or overcoat; the remaining three books can be held in the hand that is farthest from the door or the prospect. If the hand holding the three books is kept close to the side or slightly to the back, the prospect can be approached without the slightest indication of books on your person. As soon as the introduction is made, bring the three books into sight. With the right hand put two of the books under the left arm, and demonstrate the other. When this book is demonstrated take the two books from under the left arm, and place them on top of the book already demonstrated. With the right hand take the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">under</span><span class="font2"> two of the three now in both hands, put them under the left arm, and then demonstrate the remaining book. At the close of the demonstration of the second book repeat the same operation, demonstrating the third book. When the three books have thus been demonstrated, with the right hand take the two books from under the left arm and then put the other book from the left hand with those in the right hand. This puts all three books in the right hand. The next thing is a double move. While the left hand is taking the book from the left side pocket of the coat, the right hand is putting under the left arm the three books already demonstrated. As soon as the book from the left side pocket has been demonstrated, take the book from the right side pocket, put it on top of the other book and demonstrate it. The demonstration is now completed. Take the three books from under the left arm and, placing them with the last two books already in the left hand, hand the five books, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all at one time,</span><span class="font2"> to the prospect.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Never give the prospect one book at a time, for he will look at the book in his hand while one is talking about the others, and will not hear one word that is said. If the books have been properly prepared, as described later herein, and placed all at the same time in the hands of the prospect, he can not look in them and see something with which to find fault, for all that he can do with the five books in two hands is to open the top one, and it will open at the colored illustrations, having been previously prepared to do that. Extra books are carried in a hand bag.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(b)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> For a woman.</span><span class="font2"> Go to an upholsterer or dry-goods store and get either 1/3 yard of 57-inch tapestry (or 1/2 yard of 39-inch) and make a lady’s demonstration bag. (See illustration below.) One piece (A) 9&quot; x 25&quot; forms the two sides and the bottom. Two pieces (B) 6&quot; x 14&quot; form the two ends. To one of the two ends is sewn a medallion, one piece (C) 4&quot; x 12&quot;, to be snapped to the other end and the two sides with four snaps. Two pieces (D) 3&quot; x 18&quot; form the handles. Bo'th ends of each handle are sewn on the same side of the bag. Bind all raw edges of each piece with tape. Then make handles and sew them on piece A before sewing in the ends.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">This bag hangs at all times on the arm and is used to carry the books that are being demonstrated; extra books are carried in a case which is left in an inconspicuous place. At the close of the introduction slip one handle off the arm, letting it hang down next to the bag. With the free arm and hand grasp the medallion and give it a quick pull, opening the bag. Having already placed the books in the bag in the desired rotation, reach into the bag, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">without looking down,</span><span class="font2"> and take out the first book for demonstration, and put it under the arm when finished. This can be done with the first three books. The fourth book is dropped back into the bag, and the last book is brought out. When finished with the last book, take the fourth book from the bag again and hand the five books to the prospect, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all at the same time.</span><span class="font2"> (A leather purse can be hung on the same arm, in front of the demonstrating bag, which will almost hide it.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Illustration showing how to make the Demonstration Bag</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Another canvassing jacket that has been used by a great many, both brothers and sisters, is worn by the brothers between the vest and coat and by sisters under the coat. It consists of four pockets supported by suspender-like straps over the shoulders. Access to these pockets, which are about ten inches square, is obtained from the inside. The back of the pocket is made two inches higher than the pocket itself so that the books can be readily put back'into place after being demonstrated. A good way to make this canvassing jacket is to take a strip of cloth 22 inches wide and 40 inches long, or a little longer if the person is large. This strip is then folded up ten inches across the entire length and stitched in five places. This will give four pockets. The accompanying sketch will show how this jacket may be made.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(7) Keep Eyes on the Prospect</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Don’t let your eyes wander. Effective witnessing demands that the witness keep his eye on the prospect in order to hold his attention. However, this must be done in a natural way, without causing embarrassment. To the extent that one causes his prospect to be ill at ease, to that extent one’s chances of making a sale are diminished. Therefore avoid staring. One should himself be at ease and keep his eyes on his prospect in an interested and sympathetic manner. To reach down and search for a place in a book breaks the personal contact and in many cases enables the prospect to dominate the situation. This reduces the effectiveness of the demonstration and causes the loss of a number of sales. Therefore it is advisable to have books placed in a certain order in the pockets, or in the hands, or in the demonstration bag, so that it will be unnecessary to look away from the prospect in order to get the book wanted. The placing of books should receive careful attention before starting out. Knowing the outline of canvass, one should arrange the books in sequence as required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An additional suggestion regarding “breaking” books for demonstration has been sent in to the office. An outline of this method follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to make possible the demonstration of the books without taking the eyes off the prospect, it is necessary to prepare or “break” the books before leaving for the field. The preparation of the books is a very simple matter, provided the instructions are followed in detail. Open the book at the desired page just sufficiently to insert the thumb. Take a good grasp be-</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">tween each thumb and finger and open the book out straight. Do not bend out the covers beyond straight or the hook will be spoiled. Our books are composed of eleven or twelve sections. Lift up a section at the bottom of the book at the place where you have opened it and double it back, or dog-ear it about one-eighth of an inch. (See Figure 2.) The book, after being closed, will always open again at this same place. When opening a book at the colored illustrations, always open it so as to show two pictures, for it makes a better appearance, and also prevents the binding from breaking. For the five-book demonstration that will be given later, the books can be opened at the following pages: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> at pages 9, 264 and 376; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font2"> at pages 11, 112 and 212; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation </span><span class="font2">at pages 355 and at all double illustrations; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font2"> at page 7 and at all double illustrations; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font2"> at page 9 and at all double illustrations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We submit the foregoing suggestion for only those of the friends who can use it effectively. Such breaking of the book should be done very carefully, otherwise the book will be spoiled or defaced. It would be well to break only the books used for demonstration and always give the purchaser books that have not been broken. There are two objections to leaving broken books with the purchasers’. The first is that as soon as they see the fold they will feel that the books are not new. The second objection is that it is likely to be provoking to them to have the book open at the same place all the time. If one can not fix the books to open properly without damaging them, it should not be done. Many are able to get to the right places without doing this. ‘</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(8) Entering the House</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Try to gain admission. It is a known fact that a larger percentage of sales are made when the worker can enter the house and demonstrate his goods inside. There are many reasons for this. In the winter people will not leave the doors open long enough to listen. Things on the street divert their attention. Therefore, wherever possible, endeavor to enter the house. For valuable suggestions about this see the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Special Colporteur Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> “Winter Edition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Very often an impression is formed from the knock that is made at the door. A light, timid tap suggests to the housekeeper that there MAY be somebody at the door, but of not much importance. A positive, dignified knock (do not break the door down, however) implies importance and will demand attention and bring some one to the door in the expectation of something worth considering. It is seen, then, that favorable impressions can be made in advance. Another point that should be kept in mind is that it is advisable to go to the back door in the morning, because the lady of the house is more likely to be in that part of the house in the forenoon. In the afternoon better success will be obtained by going to the front door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After having knocked at the door do not stand directly in line with the door, or they will open it a fraction of an inch and peep through. Stand at the side of the opening door so that they will have to open it sufficiently to get part of their body between the door and the jamb in order to see who has called. When they are opening the door, be brushing your feet on the mat and remark that it is snowy, or muddy, or dusty, as the case may be, and that you will just step in a minute. Never ask to be let in, but rather take it for granted that you have been invited in by saying, “I appreciate your letting me in as I have something of importance to tell you.” In a great many instances they will let one in without thinking. It is well for a woman to ask for the lady of the house, and a man to inquire for the man of the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A Typical Method of Demonstrating the Five Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The most efficient distributors of the message have discovered that those who have a more or less cut-and-dried demonstration succeed the best. Witnesses who are placing the most books in the hands of the people have a set canvass that they modify slightly to suit the prospect. The five-book demonstration that follows is not given to be memorized unless it will be used in the natural every-day language of the witness. A canvass that is memorized usually sounds singsong and is not effective. Always make the demonstration personal by drawing into the canvass the person addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the introduction there are starting points that will be of interest to everybody, irrespective of who they are, such as a government that will reduce the taxes, prohibit war, provide employment for everybody, bring down the high prices of food and clothing, etc. These points should be judiciously brought to their attention according to their station in life and what you think, after &quot;sizing them up’, will be more interesting to them. Show them that you are familiar with the conditions under which they are laboring and that what you have advances a solution for their problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Two Sample Demonstrations</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(A).“Good morning. I represent Judge Rutherford, broadcasting over the watchtower network which conies to you through station (name of local station broadcasting lectures). Recently Judge Rutherford spoke over an international chain hook-up, resulting in many thousands’ writing for a copy of his lecture. So you can see that he must be telling us something of importance. In this lecture he was explaining a new government that will reduce the taxes, prohibit war, provide employment for everybody, bring down the high prices of food and clothing and make profiteering impossible. There has been such a demand for this lecture that it has been put into book form. Let me just show you a few of these books before I pass on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“This book (produce </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance')</span><span class="font2"> gives a vivid description of the great battle between the forces of good and evil which has been going on from Bible days down to the time in which we are living. This chapter (turn to page 264) is on the final battle, sometimes called the Battle of Armageddon. It explains the dragon, the beast and the false prophet and shows why there is so much trouble in the world. But the part that you will enjoy is at the close of the book (turn to page 376). You will find over 750 scriptures from all parts of the Bible to refer to. That is why I believe you will find this book very convenient and helpful. This book (produce </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp)</span><span class="font2"> is a regular textbook on the Bible. So many people have said that they wished they had a textbook on the Bible that this book has been specially prepared to fill their needs. The Lord said (read on page 11), ‘I will incline mine ear, I will open my dark saying upon the harp.’ It explains the parables of the Lord so that even a child can understand them; but the part that will be especially helpful to you contains the questions at the close of each chapter. (Turn to the close.) If you will notice, each question is numbered. The number refers to the paragraph that will answer the question. The book always gives you scriptures for its authority. You have often asked yourself, &quot;Who made the Devil?’ &quot;Where did Cain get his wife?’ &quot;What is the soul?’ &quot;Where are the dead?’ (Bring in some interesting questions and refer them to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font2"> instead of answering them. If there are any children present, show how they need </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font2"> to answer their Bible questions for them.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Now here is a book that everybody wants. (Produce </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.)</span><span class="font2"> It contains a vivid description of the creation of the earth with man upon it, and down to the &quot;new creation’ mentioned by the Apostle Paul. (Turn to page 269.) In it you will find sixteen beautiful oil painting reproductions from the leading art galleries of Europe. (Demonstrate pictures.) However, a part that is found indispensable, and that I know you will appreciate, is the index. (Turn to page 355.) Take for example &quot;K’ and &quot;Kingdom’. We have been taught to pray, &quot;Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth.’ When they asked Jesus when his kingdom would come he told them that there would be nation rising against nation, kingdom against kingdom, wars, famines, pestilences, and the poor trampled under foot while the rich would be living in luxury. Truly we see all these things happening today. When Jesus establishes his kingdom there will be reconciliation between God and man. (Produce </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation.)</span><span class="font2"> He will humble the rich and they will cast their gold and silver into the streets. As for the poor, he will remove their heavy taxes and hardships, and set up a real government for them. (Produce </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font2"> turn to page 9.) This book begins with 1914, showing how everything seems to be turning upside down, and closes by showing that out of all this trouble is to come the greatest wave of prosperity of which this world has ever dreamed. It will bring peace on earth, good-will to men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“We are placing these five beautifully-bound books in your hands for only one-ninety-eight because we know that you will appreciate the message they contain and at that price anybody can afford to enjoy them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(B) An effective method for placing books in business sections is termed “the introduction canvass”. This method has produced splendid results when properly used. One brother sold 21,000 books in one year by this method. The procedure is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A brother who is fairly well known among business people takes the colporteur out and introduces him to his business friends something like this: “Mr. Jones, I should like you to meet my friend, Mr. Smith, of New York city. He is a very special friend of mine.” That is all the introducer says. The colporteur immediately says, “Glad to meet you, Mr. Jones. You know I am not really on a business call this morning. I am representing the International Bible Students, of New York.” Then smilingly add, “I am not taking up a collection, nor even soliciting funds. I am calling upon our professional and business men with some of our publications which are having such a wonderful reception, not only in the United States, but throughout the world. Realizing that these are business hours, I will be very brief in outlining what I have.” Then follow up with a brief and clear-cut canvass of about two or three minutes' length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Four essential rules which should always be kept in mind:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(1)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> A smile on the face.</span><span class="font2"> This should be a real smile, not a forced or artificial smile, but one that comes from the heart. In residential districts the one answering the knock will in the majority of cases be the housewife. In order to be a really successful witness one must be able to put oneself in the other person’s place, so to speak. By doing this one will know just how the prospect responds under the circumstances. The average person in the world is hard pressed today. Knowing this, it should influence your approach. The housewife may be dunned by the landlord, the insurance agent, the furniture store, the automobile company, the grocery store, and a dozen others. In every instance there is a “hard-boiled” collection agent with a severe face and a domineering attitude, holding in his hand in the most conspicuous way a collection book. The things he lacks are a cheerful smile and a pleasant word. Therefore, in order to impress the prospect favorably, begin with the things which these collection agents lack. A pleasant smile will open more doors than any other one thing. Since he keeps his collection book prominently in sight, we should always keep our books out of sight-as far as possible. Then in a very informal, natural and pleasant way go through the demonstration as though it were a special thing for that person only, bringing the prospect as much as possible into the conversation. This can often be done by asking a few sympathetic questions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Under no consideration let the smile leave the face. The advantage of this is discerned when one stops to think. Does any one ever see a person get angry with a smile on his face? Keep the smile going. It is infectious. Persist in it. Many a prospect’s angry or gruff front has been broken down by a smile.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(2)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> Keep books out of sight.</span><span class="font2"> If a complete demonstration has been made and the prospect has refused to purchase the books, one should always get them out of sight, by putting them back into the pocket, holding them behind one, or quietly placing them in the demonstration bag, giving the impression of giving up hope of a sale. Then change the subject to something remote from the demonstration and endeavor to get their interest. If this can be accomplished the witness might continue, “I just happened to think; these books (bring the books back into sight) explain just the things that we have been talking about”; and start in a second effort to create interest, leaving the impression that the book is being used merely to elucidate the point being discussed. In order to have any excuse for bringing the books back when interest is developed a second time, they must be placed out of sight after the first canvass has apparently failed. In the way suggested, the witness has a real excuse for bringing them back again to illustrate the point developed later.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Our time belongs to the Lord, and it is valuable. Therefore, when one has taken the time to walk up to some person’s door and demonstrate the books to him, too much time has been invested to be turned aside by some lame excuse. On the other hand, it is well never to dispute their answer, for they will only close the door. Some other method to accomplish our mission must be devised. Getting the books out of sight with a smile is the first step in this procedure.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> Always agree with the prospect.</span><span class="font2"> This is one of the hardest things for the brethren to do. Do not be discouraged if unable to apply this at once. A master salesman once said, “A customer is always right, if we want to sell him anything.” This is not a new thought, for nearly 2000 years ago Jesus expressed the same thing when he said, “Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him.” (Matt. 5:25) Summing up this third rule, then, When out in house-to-house witnessing, agree with the prospect, regardless of what is said; but be careful that it is done properly, or trouble will result. The come-backs or rebuttals for the most common excuses for not buying will be considered next, showing how to agree with prospects without compromising the truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(a)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> &quot;I am an atheist”</span><span class="font2"> Any time a prospect says, “I am an atheist,” there is a standard response for it, i. e., </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font2"> am surely glad </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to know </span><span class="font2">that.” The witness is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font2"> glad that the prospect </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">is an atheist,</span><span class="font2"> but is glad </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to know</span><span class="font2"> it; just as one would be glad </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to know</span><span class="font2"> of a person’s being a thief, so as to know how to act. By knowing what a person is, the witness can make the canvass accordingly. Now then let us take the complete rebuttal in response to, “I am an atheist.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font2"> am surely glad to know that you are an atheist. You are too honest to believe the lies and misrepresentations that the preachers have been telling the people. Anybody with a grain of common sense can see that the big majority of them are hypocrites, just out for the gratification of their own selfish desires; and that is just what these books prove. Judge Rutherford shows that preachers and politicians and profiteers have banded together to defraud the people. Now then, you being an atheist and seeing these things the way you do, you will surely enjoy these books.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(b) &quot;Z </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">am a Catholic and we have our own Catholic literature”</span><span class="font2"> “I am surely glad </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to know </span><span class="font2">that. Quite a number of my friends are Catholic and I have always admired their zeal for their church. Recently the pope said that we should read our Bibles more. Do you know that quite a number of priests have been reading these books? Surely if they are good enough for the priests to read, they are good enough for us to read. Just let me show you some of the wonderful illustrations in them. Here (in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp)</span><span class="font2"> is a picture of the crucifixion, which is dear to the heart of every Catholic. In this book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, </span><span class="font2">is a beautiful reproduction of a famous painting of the virgin Mary mourning over the crucifixion; while in this book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font2"> is a picture of Jesus that I know you would love to have framed. These books will be a real bless-&quot; ing in your home.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(c)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> “1 am a Christian Scientist.” “I</span><span class="font2"> am surely glad </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to know</span><span class="font2"> that. In my travels I find that the Scientists are practically the only people who really believe the scriptures which declare that God is love. The majority believe that God is a huge monster of some kind. There is another thing that I appreciate about the Scientists, and that is that they appreciate the science of the Bible, which is the most scientific book in the world. We know from both science and the Bible that the flood covered the whole earth. Have you ever wondered where all the water went after the flood? This book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font2"> explains it in a way that you will enjoy. Now you, being a Scientist, will appreciate these books, and I am glad to have been instrumental in bringing them to you. When studying them, be sure to check them up with the Bible. They contain a wealth of information that you will find indispensable.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(d)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> “I am a Lutheran, and we have our own church.”</span><span class="font2"> “I am very glad </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to know</span><span class="font2"> that. Martin Luther was one of the world’s biggest men since the days of our Lord. He was the leader of the great reformation that broke the hold of the Catholic church on the people, so that today we are not bound by their superstitions and bigotry. One of the difficulties today is that quite a number of Lutherans have departed from the original teachings of Martin Luther. Now these books (produce books) take a similar position in our day to that taken by Luther in his. Therefore, you, being a Lutheran, will appreciate these books. They constitute a source of information that will bring you great blessings.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(e)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> “I have a whole library full of books that I have not read yet.”</span><span class="font2"> “If you have a whole library full of books that you have not read, [ could hardly expect that you would be interested in these. (Get books back out of sight.) By the way, have you noticed in the paper that Commander Byrd’s expedition to the South Pole is creating quite a stir. At the time expeditions were being made to the North Pole the explorers found several animals, some prehistoric, embedded in the ice, and some had green grass in their stomachs. This shows that at one time the climate was very mild up there, etc. This has puzzled scientists, but from the standpoint of the Bible the matter is quite simple. These books (produce books) contain a remarkably thorough presentation of these wonderful things. Another thing: You will find that these books will not be among those left unread. Each book contains an explanation of events that are vital to every thinking man at the present time.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(f) &quot;Z </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">am not interested.”</span><span class="font2"> Where the prospect is of the indifferent type, that is, where he is not even paying any attention to what is being said but is half-wittedly looking around, there is only one thing to do, and that is to leave as quickly as possible. Waste no more time. But where he has shown interest during the demonstration and then as an excuse for not buying replies, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font2"> am not interested,” something may yet be accomplished.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">There are three general lines of thought that may be followed, i. e., the commercial, political and religious lines. If we have made an advance along the so-called religious line and it does not sufficiently arouse an interest, there are two lines of argument left. If the prospect is of the poor or working class, he will naturally be interested in the political. He hopes to hear something that will lessen the taxes and thus make it easier for him. In that case continue as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“A</span><span class="font2"> great many people are wondering if the new administration, with Hoover at its head, will increase the prosperity of this country. This book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font2"> leaves no room for doubt and tells you of a wonderful wave of prosperity that is just over the horizon when there will be a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font2"> government set up that will actually give every one just rights, with no heavy taxes, sickness or trouble. I feel that you want to know about this new government and am therefore glad to tell you that we are able to place this wonderful combination of books in your hands for one-ninety-eight.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another suggestion in this connection is made by a witness of long experience. He says, “The fat man on page 15 of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font2"> who has to have his basket full before any one else can have anything, together with the U. S. senator’s four lines on the opposite page, make a fine hit for the attention of those who are not the least interested in the Bible. In selling to Catholics, I start with the fat man. Who on earth gave the government to the grafters, if it was not the U. S. senators?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If, on the other hand, the prospect is of the middle-class made up of business or professional men, then the best approach will be along commercial lines, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“So many people are looking to the government to boost commerce and industry and stabilize foreign trade. Have you ever thought of what a huge job this would be, in view of all the international complications? By the way, this book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font2"> (produce </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government), </span><span class="font2">shows how the whole world is going to be brought to a state of perfection, a perfection such as you and I have never dreamed of, when there will be no more war, financial or labor troubles. You will be more than interested in these books, I am sure. They deal with just the things that will be to your advantage to know.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(g)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> “I have no time to read.”</span><span class="font2"> “Your position is similar to that of the majority of people today. I suppose you have so much work that has to be done that you have very little or no time for literature. (Get the books out of sight.) I find myself in a very similar condition. Have you ever wondered why we are so busy all the year long and then at the close of the year we can barely pay our taxes? Judge Rutherford shows in these books that the whole world is dominated by profiteers and politicians and some of the commercial preachers. Take yourself, for instance. If you do not have money and good clothes, you are not welcome at the big churches. The politicians have perverted the laws, so that the poor man goes to the penitentiary while the rich go free; and the profiteers have arranged everything so that everybody is working morning, noon and night to keep them in luxury. That is why we need these books. (Produce books.) They show why these things are taking place, and they encourage us by pointing to the remedy for these difficulties.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(h)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> “I have no money.”</span><span class="font2"> “You would be surprised at the number of people that I meet who are almost without money. Do you ever wonder why the majority of the people are working from early morning to late at night and can hardly make both ends meet? Judge Rutherford shows in these books (produce books) that the whole world is dominated. ...”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">The “no money” prospect is one of the most difficult to answer, but we believe that the colporteur in the following report indicates the correct attitude to be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“When the dozen banks hereabout closed, we contemplated leaving this territory unfinished; even old-timers like us got excited, and for the first time in our whole experience we were bluffed into the belief that we could not sell books in this county. However, we were not bluffed badly enough to start to move, and now we have only a few hours’ work left in the county to complete. We have had far better success since the banks closed than we had before, impossible as that may seem!!! On March 12, [ took in $29.98 on sales made that day. Providentially tied up with car trouble, my wife was caused to do the business sections of W----,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">which she thought was HOPELESS, absolutely, with THREE CLOSED BANKS in it. IT PROVED TO BE HER BIGGEST DAY FOR THE YEAR, 1929, so far, as well as her greatest day since her breakdown in health nearly two and a half years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“MORAL:—INCREASE OF POVERTY, OPPRESSION AND ADVERSITY MULTI-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">PLIES THE PEOPLE’S HUNGER FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“However, it is not an easy thing to sell to these people who are sick at heart, discouraged to desperation, and sometimes hungry!!! They meet you with absolute conviction in their own mind that they can not and will not buy anything, no matter what it is, or what the price. Any one who is not powerfully in earnest, and who is not absolutely charged from head to foot with conviction that he has something more important for these poor souls than any other possible thing on earth, for which they could exchange their last dime, would just as well pack his grip and hunt a proposition in which he does believe. If any one thinks that our literature is the expressed opinion of man, or of a denomination of men, or if he allows his prospect to think so, he is down and out. The witness for Jehovah can not tolerate the thought that he is circulating men’s opinions or denominational views; he will not allow himself to be looked upon as a circulator of merely &quot;good books’. We have something as different from “good books” ordinarily so called, as the noonday differs from midnight. If we do not arouse ourselves to the dignity and importance of our message and commission, who will? We are not looking for people who have money; we are looking for people who are sufficiently interested in the message of Almighty God to be willing to pay the cost of paper and ink to print and deliver the same to another home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“On one occasion the disciples had difficulty, in fact a total failure, when they attempted a miracle in the name of Jesus. When the matter was brought to Jesus’ attention, he, in answer to their question, Why?’ explained to them: &quot;Because of your unbelief. ... If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. Howbeit, this kind goeth not out but by prayer.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;&quot;LET US THEN REALLY BELIEVE IN OUR MESSAGE AND OUR COMMISSION.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">(i)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> “Our preacher told us not to buy these books”</span><span class="font2"> “Thank you for telling me that. He probably means well, but you know that for centuries the Catholic priests would not let their congregations read anything the priests did not approve. Today we can still see the effect this has had upon Catholics. So many of them are superstitious and bigoted. Now we would not like to get like that, would we? Do you know that practically every big preacher in this country has these books in his library? Probably your preacher has been getting some of his sermons from these books. Millions of people have bought them, and there is no reason why you should not have them, too. At one-ninety-eight for the five books anybody can afford them.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">It is not recommended that the witness try to memorize any of the foregoing canvasses. They are merely examples of how to meet objections that are put forward, and demonstrate how simple .methods can be used that bring more success in witnessing. Notice that, in each of the cases there given, the reply &quot;agrees with the prospect quickly’. But it does more. It agrees with him and then takes his excuse as the reason for agreeing with him. For example: &quot;&quot;I am a Lutheran.” Say, “I am glad to know that you are a Lutheran. Martin Luther was one of the world’s biggest men since the days of Jesus.” Therefore, to put this rule into operation, always agree with them and then use their excuse as a reason for doing so, for it would be improper, generally, to agree with them without qualifying or giving a logical reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(4) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leave in a friendly attitude.</span><span class="font2"> One of the leading house-to-house canvassing corporations counts on going over a territory </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eight</span><span class="font2"> times to thoroughly cover it. In our work, if out of every five interviewed we sell one person one or more bound books, we call it “100 percent sales”. If we sell only one out of five, what about the other four? At four out of the five places where we have interviewed we have been doing what salesmanship terms &quot;missionary work’. This does not mean that we go around with long pious faces or a religious air. It means that we are doing an introductory work: paving the way for another interview. If the books are not placed at the first call, do not be discouraged; for we are going to keep calling until something is left in their hands. Therefore it is absolutely necessary to leave them in a friendly attitude. By our so doing, each time they will become a little more friendly and will have received just a little more truth, until at last they will look forward to the visits and say, “Next time you are around come in and see me again.” They will tell their friends that &quot;though we can not agree with the Bible Students in all their teachings, yet they are surely agreeable people and we like to have them call on us’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An illustration of how effectively this works was manifest in what some colporteurs found in Elgin, Texas. Some parts of Elgin were canvassed by* a class in that vicinity four weeks prior to the coming of the colporteurs. In fact, this class had worked the territory twice during the previous eighteen months. One of the colporteurs writes: “By the Lord’s grace we were able to put in the hands of the people 256 books and booklets in five and a half days. Elgin has about 3000 population and is very scattered in all directions.” The brethren previously working the territory left a good impression, and the colporteurs coming afterward reaped the benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the same connection we have a letter from another colporteur who writes, “There were a great many books sold here last fall and they are all the talk. That has helped us greatly in placing what we have distributed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With heartiest greetings and much Christian love,</span></p>

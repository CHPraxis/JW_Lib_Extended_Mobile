<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">REMEMBER IBSA WEEK: MAY 19-26</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">The response to our request for a report on the number of friends who would devote three or more days to the service has been enthusiastic and has exceeded our expectations. We quote from one or two of the letter’s which we have received to show how the friends are taking hold of tills. One class writes: “We shall have 18 workers who will work 68 hours during the week, 8 will work five whole days, 10 will work four days, and 2 workers are arranging to work 4 extra hours, from five to nine o’clock in the evening.” Another class reports that 6 out of 7 workers In the class are making plans to spend May 24 to 26 entirely in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are numerous other reports of the same strain, Indicating tire enthusiasm with which the friends are starting out ou IBSA Week this year. To date there is a total of 582 workers who have reported that they will spend three or more days in the service besides their regular time during the rest of the week. The total number of days set apart for special work by these brethren amounts to 155SJ. In addition to the foregoing, a number of the larger classes have advised us that they were unable to give us the total number of workers who would devote three or more days to the service, due to the fact that most of the friends were unable to make arrangements so far ahead. One class of 125 advises that 75 of them are going to be in the service during these three days. We believe that the total of all the brethren devoting three or more days to the service will easily amount to 1500 by the time all the reports are compiled, and we are hoping that by the time IBSA Week comes around tii ere will be 500 more added to this, making a total of 2000, or fifty percent of the quota of weekly workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The importance of the occasion will justify every one of the friends’ putting forth a very determined effort to get as much time off as possible for this week, A little more persistence and looking to the Lord to open the way will, we believe, enable a number of the friends who now think it Impossible to get any time off from their secular employment to get the latter part of the week off for canvassing. AU things are possible with the Lord. Therefore let none be discouraged, but ask in faith and act in accordance therewith, and see if the results are not surprizing. “Prove me now herewith,” is the Lord’s challenge to our lack of faith. Therefore let each one of the anointed take the Lord at his word. Tell him that you want to put all the time possible into the work for this drive, asking him</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Committee Must Prepare</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have come to the time of final inspection before the big drive. Are you ready? A series of questions prepared for each one of the Lord’s anointed, and another series for the service committee, follow. Go over these carefully. Check them up and see if you are ready for the big drive. Each service committee should arrange to hove Its final service meeting the Thursday, Friday or Saturday before IBSA Week, and all the details should be carefully gone over and final preparations made so that ail will understand their parts and can cooperate intelligently and effectively. This will do much toward making the drive a success.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Many Will Be Sent to Classes for 3 Days Enthusiasm Runs High</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The Brooklyn factory and oilice are keeping the brethren m Um field supplied with literature, and we are fully aware that slopping the presses and other machinery essential to the manufacture of books very materially affects the production ; yet the importance and significance of this spring drive on the Devil's stronghold is So great that Brother Rutherford has authorized the closing of the factory and olliee from Thursday evening, May 23. until Monday morning, May 27, so that each member of the Bethel Family may have a part, in this drive. They are going out 175 strong during these three days, as well as at every available opportunity during the rest of the week. This adds 175 more workers to the 1500 that will participate from the classes, and will give us a good start towaro attaining the 2000 we are hoping will spend three or more days in the service during the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the foregoing, Brother Rutherford has authorized the regional service department to supply Bethel brethren as local regional service directors for these three days to classes east of Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, north of Richmond, Va„ south of Toronto, Ont., Can., and east to the Atlantic. Therefore, if your class is within the above area and there are enough friends who will participate in the service during these three days to make up parties of ten or more, the Society will be glad to assign brethren to lend them out and to direct the work in general. Arrangements can be made to hold service testimony meetings on Saturday and Sunday evening, If deemed advisable, as well as a brief service talk on the privileges of the Lord’s people at this time and the honor that is conferred npon them to represent him. Late Sunday afternoon or Sunday evening can be set aside for a general getting together and recounting of the week’s blessings ami results, followed by a discourse closing the IBSA Week drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The foregoing privileges are, of course, not limited to the Englishspeaking classes. Other eceleslas of the Lord’s people, regardless of what language they speak, should have part in this great drive and should make careful arrangements to see that the most effective witness possible is given. The same provision that is made for supplying Bethel brethren for the Englishspeaking classes will apply to the classes speaking other languages. Tn both eases, however, we have only a limited number of brethren who can serve in this capacity; and (Continued on this page, column 8)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Sale of Booklets Not to Be</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Overlooked</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some have not understood that there Is to be no change made In the retail price of the five-book combination when packed in the flashtone eartons. They will continue to sell for $1.98 (or $2 it preferred). The additional In) for the carton will be added to the cost, but not to the selling price. It Is hoped that these eartons will aid in the placing of so many more complete combinations that this increase in cost will be more than offset. We should like to have the service directors and colporteurs let us know whether tiie cartons aid in the sale of the five books. The selling of the books in cartons is not to be confined to IB SA Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, in this campaign the special effort is to be put forth on the sale of the five bound books; but this does not mean that one should overlook the placing in the hands of the people some of the booklets too. When the customer does not lake the books and you con place with him </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Judgment</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Oppression,</span><span class="font4"> you are leaving with him a continual reminder of the five books which will pave the way for the next call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Reporting Time of Workers and Colporteurs in Canvassing Parties</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With hundreds of canvassing parties being arranged in all parts of Ilie earth for IBSA Week, the question has arisen in the minds of some as to how to report the time of the various members of the party. The method which should be carried out now, and at all other times, is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bor a class worker to receive the special elass rates, the requirement calls for a minimum of three hours’ canvassing a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The auxiliary colporteur requirement is a minimum of ten hours during the week in actual canvassing, exclusive of that which might be done on Sunday. Of course, if any canvassing is done on Sunday this should be reported also, but it should not be considered in meeting the minimum requirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wliou Individuals canvass alone, the time begins to count at the time they begin their first canvass until the last one is completed. The time spent going to and from the territory is not to be counted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When workers go out in canvassing parties to work distant territory, be they class workers or auxiliary colporteurs, the time of each individual begins to count at the time the party leaves the hall or place of assembly until his last call Is completed. The automobile driver’s time counts the same as the other workers’, provided he alternates in canvassing with the other members of the party in working rural routes when the two-car system is used. If only one car is available, then his time spent in driving counts, in case he himself is one who takes an active part in the actual canvassing whenever opportunities arise. In the case of auxiliary colporteurs acting as drivers, their time may be considered in meeting their required ten hour's for the week, provided at least six hours of the required ten are given In the actual canvassing. ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">REMEMBER IBSA WEEK: MAY 19-26</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Don’t Forget IBSA Report Cards</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are enclosing with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> a special IBSA Week report card /or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the service director only. </span><span class="font4">The card is to cover the eight days set apart for IBSA Week; and it should not be confused with the regular weekly report, which covers only seven days, concluding with Sunday night. The weekly report card should be sent in as usual, as though you had no IBSA Week report card to forward. We want at the end of the year fifty-two of the regular weekly report cards covering each week’s work, as well as the IBSA Week report cards. Hake out the IBSA Week report as promptly us possible and forward it to this office. We would request that each worker in the elass cooperate with the service director in getting this information together as quickly as possible. This arrangement does not apply to the colporteurs. The method of reporting for the colporteurs is outlined on Page 1 pf the April </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font4"> where they are requested to show on thefr reports for the special IBSA Week eight days, including the two Sundays. Colporteurs will please read this again, in order to be sure as to tow to make out colporteur reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Order Blanks for Classes</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently each organized service class was forwarded, in care of the director, six copies of the new order blank. Hereafter all elass orders are to t« made on these blanks. They are for our mutual convenience, and will do much to insure accuracy. The supply sent to each class is for throe mouths, on the basis of one order a mouth. The instructions on the back of the blanks will explain bow they are to be filled out.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">IBSA Week will be followed with a strenuous campaign throughout tiie summer in the rural districts by the classes and colporteurs. It is hoped that this year all the territory assigned will he worked thoroughly, and that those living on the side roads, as well as those on the main highways ami in small country towns, will be called upon. The farmers have been suffering from much oppression and should be given the opportunity to hear of the good news of God’s kingdom. The lime to call upon them is when the roads are good and you can get to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Holidays Prove to Be Good Time for Giving the Witness</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The month of May should prove to be one of the greatest ever, so far as giving the witness is concerned. Not only is there to be the special effort put forth throughout the earth during IBSA Week, but in this country this is followed by a holiday on the 20th. Memorial Day will give the friends another opportunity to have an active part in the service, and service directors should make plans In advance for special canvassing parlies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the friends have hesitated to go out into the work on holidays, feeling that they would not meet with any interest. But, some time ago almost every one thought the same about Sunday. Now al! find it to be one of the best days for calling on the people. The same is true of special holidays. The following letter expresses the sentiment of many who have seized the opportunity to testify tu the honor of Jehovah’s name on such occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;I canvassed three hours the moraing of Mardi Gras day (which is a general holiday in New Orleans) and left 26 books and booklets, mid got more joy that day than I have ever known before. I had the same experience on New Year’s Day, which was another holiday. In my canvassing of each one I found them more friendly limn at any other time, and they gave me &quot;a better hearing. Also, more men are at home. They are Ihe ones who control the family purse strings, and more sales are imide. So I found holidays to be a very good lime Io give a witness, even lictter than ordinary days. There Is no reason for any one, if he can do so, not to witness on such days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May can lie made a record-breaker by following up IBSA Week with another big canvassing party on Memorial Day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Your IBSA Week Shopping Early</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You have only a little more than two weeks, and then the big drive is on. How is your stock of literature? Have you sufficient to last you during tiie drive? It is much better to be overstocked than to run out of ammunition in the midst of the battle. The director should see to it that all tiie workers are well supplied with books and booklets and have plenty of books in your bookrooin to replenish their stock. Each service director should take up this matter with the stock-keeper and carefully check over tiie stock and make out an order immediately. Rush orders at the Iasi minute can nut be filled, because the office and factory are preparing to close during Friday and Saturday, May 24 and 25, to permit those at Bethel to have three days in the field.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">May 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The colporteur branch of the Lord’s army reports everything In readiness for the great attack on May 19-26, New recruits are continually swelling the ranks, and more applications are being mailed out each day. According to present indications, the fighting force which the colporteur division will place In the field at that time will be tiie greatest in the history of tho church. There are now 11.98 enrolled in the full time work and 617 auxiliaries; and 46 additional ones have signified their Intention to start working as pioneers prior io May 19, which should Increase the list to 1244. Applications for 49 have been accepted to go into effect on June 1 or thereafter. We are wondering, however, If by making special effort, these and others wlm are thinking of entering later might not be able to be on the front line when the great drive begins. Surely tiiere could be no grander privilege than to be found in the very forefront of the battle at a time such as this, when the anointed throughout the earth will be shouting forth the battle-cry. Already some who have thought, it Impossible to be.gln before June 1 are writing us as indicated in the following letter received from a party of three:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Lord is arranging things for us so fast that il looks now that we shall be able to get Into our territory in time to start to work on Sunday, May It), the beginning of JB8A week.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Remember, the colporteurs are to have a special part in this great attack. They are going to endeavor to average 40 hours actual canvassing for this eight-day period. Of course this will mean that all who can give more time than this will be anxious to do so in order to make up for those who come short because of sickness. Also remember that the work done for the entire eight-day period is to be reported on the regular weekly report card, but tor the EIGHT days instead of the usual seven. This will mean that the report for the preceding week will be for only six days. Be sure to mail your report on Sunday night, May 26, so that we can tabu late tiie final results as quickly as possible. All is in readiness. The little band of colporteurs but awaits the comm and to go over the top. While waiting they are actively singing forth the praises of their king. And we want to say right here that you’ll have to look far and wide before you'll find a happier, more zealous and faithful int. Already for the first six months of the year 1he regulars and auxiliary colporteurs have placed a total of 0,15,130 books and ten-cent booklets. Just watch what they do on this special drive! Not because they want to merely sell books, but rather because they love the Lord so much that they want to sing forth bisjjraises. ___ </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">pares the Country</span></p>

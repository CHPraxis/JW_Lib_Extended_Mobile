In spite of the wide-spread &quot;flu” epidemic.

SilckneHM has kept a lot. out of the work; many have failed to report nt all; and the stile of booklets has fallen 'way behind for this period.

<p><span class="font4">I era. In considering these causes we itind the chief one to be the &quot;flu&quot;, ; which amounted almost to au epi-1 domic in some parts of the country. In some places schools have been</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I closed since January 12. Mauy of i the friends have also suffered from this, being taken out of the service for a considerable period. The reports also indicate that from 33 percent to 75 percent of the homes canvassed were affected by this sickness, which did a great deal to retard the witness. Another obi structiug condition was that it was ' Christmas month; und while undoubtedly much was ticeomplisheil by following up immediately the territory previously canvassed with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The People# Friend</span><span class="font4"> ami thus taking advantage of the interest created, and also by the attractiveness of tlie five-book combination, yet, despite all this, we have to acknowledge that. December is the worst month of the year. The Devil has made a very thorough jeb of com nie.rcinliz.iiig the non-essential things i&lt;i.id making them attractive to the jioople und blinding the minds of fhe majority to the actual need of tin* essential tilings, so that the normal effectiveness of our message was to a great extent diminished during the month of December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These were the oaistanding reasons. undoubtedly, for the low sale-during that month. However, -we do not. want to dwell entirely on the unfavorable phase of the month’s work. There were also a number of encouraging features to It. Despite tbe milliy retarding features mentioned above, December, 1928, was the most consistently active December the classes have had. The average number of workers in the field</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4">year. Tn other word^ tlie efficiency of the workers in tlie field increased about 2S percent; so that with 55 fewer workers we were able to place over 2,000 more bound books in the hands of the people during the month than wc placed a year ago. Vite are confident that if the conditions were anything like the average December we would easily show a fifty-percent increase in the bound books sold. Surely this is gratifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, it leaves us quite a way behind our quota ; mid in order to accomplish what we have set out to do and magnify the name of our God as we had hoped to do, each one will have to take another hitch in his helt and buckle down a little harder. These experiences make us appreciate the fact that wc are in a real battle. It is a real warfare. During December the enemy obtained some advnntiii'x’H by udfiing more misery to the human family and retarding the normal effect of our witness and probably by trying to cause some of the Lord’s witnesses to become discouraged because of not reaching the quota they have set for themselves. In this latter mutter, at least, he can not succeed; for an Impartial analysts of the results clenrly demonstrates that in spite of all that he can do we have not lost uny ground over last year. During October and November the advantage was on our side. We more than kept up with our quota, except for a few booklets. We have lost a little in the enemies' counter-attack in December, However, this will easily be made up in January and February, particularly in February, we ore confident.; for tbe epidemic of &quot;flu&quot; Is still pretty severe in certain parts of the country and will in all probability affect our second </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">People# Friend</span><span class="font4"> drive. Therefore it is going to require added diligence on the part of all to maintain our present position und press the enemy more effectively, and of the service committee In planning the work and making a careful analysis of the field and ascertaining favorable or unfavorable conditions that exist and then carefully couching the workers so that these can successfully meet every situation. These matters should also Ik&gt; taken up with tbe regional service director when he visits you. His experience with the same conditions in other classes will be a great help. Then the workers should carefully sern-tinlze their individual arrangenieuts with a view to devoting more time ami energy io the service. In this way only can we hope to overcome the temporary advantage of the enemy and attain to our objective In the distribution of the message.</span></p>

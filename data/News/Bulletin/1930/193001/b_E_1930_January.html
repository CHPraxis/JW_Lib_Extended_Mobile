<p><span class="font4">The Society outlined in the special </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> of Ittweniher die activities anil arrangements imide tor Ilie coming year. The big thing, as you have already noticed, is the remarkable change ia the price of the books to the public, which becomes effective January 23. It is almost unbelievable that we cun offer </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">Ilie people seven cJoth-bouml books for $2.40. but still it is a tael. Not only 1ms liiis urrangcruent </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font4">made fur books, but we hope that during the year millions of booklets will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">placed, duo to flic ehftngc </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">I heir prices. By offering the people two booklets for 15c, four for 25 &lt;j, or nine for 50c we believe a splendid witness cun be given with these pretty color-covered booklets. Each of them contains a short, interesting message in regard </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">the King</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">dom, </span><span class="font4">and can be left with those who eiuniot immediately afford ti set of seven. It. will prepare them for your second, third, fourth and fifth visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, too, the other arraiigement Unit, was made, of allowing a ten-pereeut discount ini nil combinations totaling over $1.50. is surely an inducement for placing this Kingdom Gospel in the bunds of the people. Didn't it rejoice your heart when you found out that you could go from dour 1.0 door now, preaching the Kingdom and offering these seven books to Ilie people for so low an amount'.' Ot course it did. We very firmly believe that the 2,750,0(10 clolh-bouud books and 2,750.000 booklets of our quota will easily lie placed tills year, dim Io these new prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Government, reports indicate that the number of unemployed is increasing mid coiulitions among the people are becoming severe, but Isn’t it true that in this time of stress and perplexity the people really are beginning io wonder what it is nil alnnit? While suffering and oppression are increasing, the Lord has graciously arranged it so that we ran leave with tiimii fills beautiful set for mi iinioiini that even ilie poor can't refuse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the pioneers liml Unit during the campaign for January 25-li'eIj-rnury 2 they can place more sets of seven -it $2.-l(i tlui'i they could sets of six at $2.45, we should like to bear from lliem. I hiring that week the classes and auxiliary eoljxir-letll'S will lie working with Propli-ivp only, and from February ,3 mi witli the new set of .seven, All seven books for only X2.-KI I Doesn't that make you almost bubble over with happiness? And why shouldn't it. when you see rljut a ith this new arrangement flits Kingdom Gospel, which must, be preached, can be preached to a greater number of people. If fills: proves to be true, then the ptirjstse of this reduction will have been accompli shed. Thu only reason for placing literature in the homes of the people is that this Kingdom Gospel may be preached as the Lord said it must be. Happy is our lot in having part hi this tie-mondotts campaign. We hope everyone n il! make airiti icemen is as outlined in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bnlleliit</span><span class="font4"> for the coming year: and may it lie a blessed one fur everybody.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Yes, we do, and we further realize that the Lord’s kingdom is not a muller of seasons. It is here for all rime and for till seasons, winter as well ns summer. Jit this connection we should like to quote from a letter received from a regional service director in the northern states, &quot;The severe weather demoralized the bus lines; on account of the snowdrifts the ear froze up.

<p><span class="font5">5,540 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Workers in the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">quarter of a million cloth-bound books were placed in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">hands of the people during the month of November! Isn’t that wonderful? It seems as IL’ the Lord's anointed </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ones </span><span class="font4">are entering into the spirit of the work more than ever before. In spite of some who have grown cold, In spite of the increased opposition on the part of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ilie enemy, </span><span class="font4">and in spite of bad weather mid everything to make the month of November a poor one for the work, onward inarched the Lord's army for one of the greiilosl: mouths yet. The Lord blessed the obedient ones richly, and many were the letters received expressing the joy experienced by those who participated In the work. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Seme </span><span class="font4">hesitated in entering into the drive with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies.</span><span class="font4"> but. those who responded to the cull were surprised to see the way in which the Lord blessed their efforts. But isn't that just what should be expected when the Lord is directing the work of his organization? His blessings upon this special drive prove that his favor is with those who love him and keep bis coinmtiudinenls. It also indicates Hint the time has come In which to offer the later books to the people at a reduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A quarter of a million books in one month! .lust think of il. The exact total was 250,636 I woks, 96,()99 miscellaneous booklets, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">36,</span><span class="font4">796 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">People* Friend.</span><span class="font4"> nr a grand total of 383,526 different pieces of literature. Of this number the classes placed 128.775 books. 44.121, booklets, and 23,619 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend;</span><span class="font4"> the pioneers, 1)9,36.1 books, 45.912 booklets, and 10,711 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">People* Friend;</span><span class="font4"> and the auxiliary colporteurs, 22,503 books, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">6,966 </span><span class="font4">booklets, ami 2,160 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend.</span><span class="font4"> It was a glorious month, for through 1 ho special effort put forth 20.253 complete sets of the seven volumes of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scripti/ro*</span><span class="font4"> were distributed. Besides this, 12,112 miscellaneous books, the majority of which, presumably, were odd volumes of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies,</span><span class="font4"> were also placed. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some excellent work was done The great deterininin.g factor is not the weather, but our love and devotion for the Lord and his cause, and where that exists neither nine nor devil can hold back God's messengers. The worse the weather conditions are, the more lime the pix&gt;-liie have to read. Take advaulage, then, of this golden opportunity. Work during the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each director will make a special report for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Proplieea</span><span class="font4"> drive. Your report for the week before the drive will end Friday evening, January 21, Your special drive report will commence Saturday, J unitary 25 and continue to include Sunday, February 2. Flense mail this report promptly. If all t.tie reports lire sent to the office promptly, we shrill be able to lot you know the results in the March </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span><span class="font4"> Otherwise we shall have to hold it up until April. We therefore call upon each worker and each director to cooperate in this; the worker by reporting to the director promptly, and the director by compiling the information and mailing it promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the later books aho, tor many </span><span class="font4">of the colporteurs and class workers during drive week disposed of their sets so quickly that they had to spend the rest </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of the week </span><span class="font4">with the newer books. And then, of course, only the eight days from November </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1(1 </span><span class="font4">to 17 were devoted to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Serip-hire, Studies,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> except for </span><span class="font4">future deliveries of orders taken during that week. Of the later books 96,756 volumes wm-p ptnccd. So taking u]i in all it was indeed a glorious month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of those who participated and submitted reports there Were </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">996 </span><span class="font4">different pioneers to report once, but only an average of 836 who reported four times during </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">month. That is not so good when it. is considered that there were 1,(i96 on Ilie active list besides 31 suspended pioneers, Of the Mil auxiliaries on the active list 497 rejmrted once, mid an average of 396 sent in four reports. It. seems too bud that all </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">those who are receiving the colporteur privileges do not s«‘ the necessity of being regularly engaged in the work, ami at. least of reporting. There </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font4">a big decline </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font4">the average number of hours a week given to the work by those who did re</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">port, dropping </span><span class="font4">from 23.37 in October </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to 19.77 </span><span class="font4">in November. Of course the rainy weather had much to do with tills, but we would encourage the eoljiorteurs to keep on the alert to take advantage of every moment if they desire to keep in the pioneer work. Unless one gives the time to the work he cannot liope to succeed. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font4">auxiliaries reporting averaged 9.76 hours a week, as compared with 9.91 during Oetolier. This is considerably short of the required 12, and we sincerely hope that they will put forth n strenuous effort to maintain tlieir requirements. The class workers averaged 4,308 out in the work weekly, and averaged 4 hours each in the wort: during each of the 4 weeks. The total average number of workers in the Held each week was 5,540. Tliat’s just </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">160 </span><span class="font4">short of the 6,090 called for in the quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though the weather lie bad mal the roads worse, be of good cheer, remembering that. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This t;&gt;/*pel of the Kiilffdom .IJliSt Be 1‘e'iti’ed</span><span class="font4"> nnd that Jehovah lias given yon the commission </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">do </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">your </span><span class="font4">part.</span></p>

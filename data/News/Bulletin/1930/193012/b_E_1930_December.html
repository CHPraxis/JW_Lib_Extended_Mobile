<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">New Prices a Good Thing for 1931 Witness</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Last year's report shows a splendid amount of work done in the interest of the Lord’s kingdom and for the magnifying of the name and word of Jehovah. Wc are firmly convinced that the witness work will increase throughout the coming .years, even though there are distressing conditions in tlie work!. The results of ttie past year would make glad the heart of any anointed son of God mid should create in such a one an even greater zeal and determination to serve him. The Lord, through iiis organization, blessed ids people throughout the year as they made efforts to honor ids name. The plans set forth by the Society last year received the Lord's rich blessing and approval, and this is most manifest in the results of the work accomplished by the workers in the field. Again it is the privilege of the Society to set forth, in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> the outline of the work that we hope to accomplish to the Hory </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">f,r fhwl during Hie</span><span class="font2"> coming year, 1931.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">First of all, we have set our quota for this new year at &quot;ten million testimonies”. This sounds like a lot, and it is, but by the Lord’s grace Ibis tremendous witness can be given in the United States by those of the remnant in this country. This quota was set on t he following basis :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The average number of class workers in the field during the past year was 4,375 reporting weekly. This was an increase of 475 class workers over the previous year, or a 12-pereent increase. During the 15(1,(100Hour Week there were 8,692 class workers who engaged in door-to-door witnessing for that week alone. This number of workers also included the various foreign-speaking brethren, who, during the past year, have taken a very active part in the field work, and who also have been greatly blessed by the Lord. We believe that during the coming year- many more of those foreign-speaking brethren will see their opportunity of service more clearly, ■ is will also many of the English-speaking brethren who in the past have participated in special service weeks only. This being true, and we feel sure it will be, because of the increasing light, we estimate that we would have at least an 8-pcreent increase for 1931. This would bring the class workers up to an average of 4,725 reporting regularly, each week. However, from the ranks of these class workers we hope that during the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">year </span><span class="font2">we shall have on our list 81 new auxiliary colporteurs and also 75 new pioneer colporteurs. These, of course, we would have to deduct from the num</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ber </span><span class="font2">of class workers. This would leave 4,567 class workers who we anticipate will be actively engaging in the Lord's service each week. We have therefore set the quota of class workers at 4,500 reporting to the class directors each week. We can do it. Look at October’s figures and keep up the good work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AUXILIARY COLPORTEUR WORKERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During 1930 an average of 544 auxiliary colporteurs reported weekly. This is an increase of 33 percent over 1929. That is an increase. If we have but half of this increase daring the coming year, or 15 percent, we may expect to have 81 additional auxiliary colporteurs reporting each week during 1931. This would make a total of 625 auxiliaries reporting weekly. During the</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Three Books for $1.00, Special Combination</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Combinations Very Attractive</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Haven’t the times been hard during this past year? Yet, in spite of all the unemployment and perplexing conditions of this country the Lord’s people have gone on as never liefore, and now, in the midst of all this, the Lord is ready to meet the needs of the people. It has been made possible during the past year, only by the Lord's grace, to bring down slightly the cost of production and distribution of our books, and it would be just like tlie Lord and his organization to pass this reduction on to the groaning creation of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On January 1, 1931, the new prices of the Society's literature will go into effect. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Deliverance, Creation, Heetm-eilintion. Government, Life</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Propheel/</span><span class="font2"> can be placed with the people at 35c each, or any three of these hooks for S1.00. Isn't that a wonderful oiler? All seven of them cau be offered for $2.20. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light </span><span class="font2">books (One and Two) may be offered to the people for only 75c. 'These two books with four booklets will make another ideal combination for $1,00. With the depressing con-winter months some </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font2">auxiliary colporteurs drop off, but we hope that this will not take place during this coming year, because in the tdties many of the apartments and homes with vestibules can </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font2">worked during these months. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Why </span><span class="font2">not try them this winter? We are setting the quota of auxiliary colporteurs nt 625 reporting each week, and we hope that sometime during the year there will be a peak of a thousand auxiliary workers actively engaged in the field service. Do you think we can make it by the middle of the summer in 1931?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Why not write to the Society and investigate the splendid arrangement which the laird has made to enable you to spend twelve hours in the witness work each week, and be one of the thousand?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER COLPORTEURS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every week during the past year an average Of 938 pioneer colporteurs have been reporting to this office. This is an increase of il percent, over the previous year. Wc hope to have an eight-percent increase in the number of pioneers during the coming year, and this would mean that we would have to have an average of 75 more pioneers reporting each week, which would (Continued on page 2, column 2) dirlons and the shortage </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">money among the poor, the dollar combination will seem reasonable to them, and we urge that during the coming year all the friends stress this combination particularly. If you are in some territory where the people are a little better situated financially, it would be lie Iter to offer the nine hooks for the new price of .$2.90, or any six books, including </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> for .$1.95. We believe that with these new prices going Into effect January 1 many more books will lie placed in the hands of the people, as well its booklets. The booklets are going over fine at the present time, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">will continue </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">do so, because of the attractive offer of nine booklets for fifty cents or four for a quarter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have the greatest message to give to the people, a message of real comfort and cheer to everyone, and at the same time we have the message in a permanent form at a most reasonable price. The Lord is good to liis people. With this splendid new arrangement for the coming year it seems quite evident that the number of books and booklets mentioned in our estimate, as given in the “Quota” article of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> will be reached.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Your Year Book and Calendar</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Each of the Anointed Should Have One President’s Report Excellent</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These will be ready for you shortly, and we should like to say a few words about them. First of all we will talk about your </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book. </span><span class="font2">This Year </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Book</span><span class="font2"> has in it the best report ever made by the president of the Society. It is because the friends are actively engaged iu the field service proclaiming the message nf the Kingdom that makes this report what it is. So then every one of the Lord's anoinled should avail himself of this new </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book </span><span class="font2">for 1931, which contains Brother Rutherford's report and also an explanation of tlie year text chosen by tlie Society. There is also a text for each day of the year, together with a brief comment in consideration and explanation of the text. A very interesting and helpful feature of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font2"> this year is that at the end of each daily comment reference is made to the Watch Toicw or book from which the comment is taken. This will give you an opportunity to look up points that may have slipped your mind or to more fully examine some detail of the (ext. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font2"> Is offered to all at 50e a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And now for your calendar. The Society is printing a very beautiful calendar for the year, and we know that everyone will like it. It is truly a calendar for tlie Lord's people been use it gives an outline of the big features of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the year,</span><span class="font2"> giving the most Important dates as far as the Lord's people are concerned. You will want this calendar hanging on your wall, where you can refer to it from time to time. These calendars are offered in lots of 50 at 25c apiece, or when bought singly, at 30c. You will need both the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font2"> and the calendar during this coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Directors, Please Note</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font2"> is being mailed to alt Wfftclt </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font2"> subscribers. We are sending only a limited supply to the class directors.

<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Over 150 Stations to Begin December 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">By January 4 More Will Be on the Air</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Did You Get a Station?</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>If Not, Try Again</span></h4>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Radio Folders Being Shipped</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Responses coming in from classes nil over the country in regard to the new feature of radio broadcasting are most encouraging. Up to Ilie present there are over 150 stations signed up, and on December 7 these will begin broadcasting the electrically recorded lectures of Brolher Rutherford. These lectures are short, only 13} minutes, but they tire full of punch and drive home the point, giving a logical and clear explanation of God’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those classes that begin broadcasting ihcse lectures in </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">their lo</span><span class="font2">calities on December 7 will, we feel sure, have </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">splendid introduction to their field service work. With the 150 or more stations now prepared to broadcast these lectures the entire population of the United States will have an opportunity to listen in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many classes have asked whether they cannot go on the air with these lectures at a later date if they can Ihen make the arrangements. We are glad to say &quot;Yes” in answer to this question. If any classes can make arrangements to go on the air beginning with January </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">4,</span><span class="font2"> please let us know at the very earliest possible date. If you have a radio station in your city' and it does not carry the watchtowkk programs you might see whether or not it is possible to make arrangements to have these splendid lectures broadcast. Stations that heretofore would not. take any of our programs are now doing so. This is the Dord’s work and it will prosper. If you want any information in regard to how to go about this matler and you have not received such information from the Society, please write us. The Society has written to many classes explaining this means of getting the truth into the homes of the people, but we have not received a response from all the classes to whom we wrote. We feel sure that after you know that such a tremendous effort, has been put forth to make this broadcast a success you will want to try to get the best available stations and put on these watciitowkk programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">New radio folders are ready for shipment. These were held up in order that as many as possible of the stations engaged for the new transcription service might be listed on the folder. The first edition of the folder contains a total of 143 stations carrying the watchtowkb programs and the time when they are on the air with this program. Whether or not there is a station in your immediate vicinity on this list, you should use these radio slips in connection with your door-to-door witnessing. The Lord has opened up to us h wonderful field for service in the interest of his Kingdom. We are happy that we were privileged to take advantage of this means of spreading the Kingdom message. Those classes and colporteurs who have placed orders with us for 1500 and under will have their orders filled complete, but all orders over 1500 we have taken the liberty to cut approximately one-third and even less In some esses. This was done that you might not be overstocked with slips showing the old prices of the literature. If your order is filled short, please keep in mind that within a few weeks we will till the balance of your order with a new slip which will have all of the radio stations listed and also give the new prices on the literature. We believe this will be satisfactory to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Continued from page 1, column 3) bring our weekly average of active pioneer colporteurs up to 1,010. We </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font2">setting a quota, therefore, of 1,000 pioneer colporteurs for 1931. This will be the highest average pioneer reporting each week for a year we shall have ever had, if we do it. It is possible. What do you say, you pioneers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The average number of pioneer colporteurs reporting each week during ttie last five months has been 1,020. But the winter is coming on, and in the past some felt that they must hibernate. Why cease working? Why not try to stick through the winter? The Lord will bless you. He promises that to everyone who really wants to serve. However, we hope that by the time the fiscal year 1931 ends we shall have on our list mauy more than a thousand colporteurs, setting as the peak 1,400 pioneers. They are a happy crowd and the Lord blesses them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Having in </span><span class="font2">mind now the average number of class workers for the year, which is to be 4,500, we expect that they will put in an average of 4.2 hours in the service each week. This is an increase of only 1/10 of an hour, or just six minutes more in the service each week this year than last. But </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">by the </span><span class="font2">end </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the year, if this number of class workers diligently engage in the Lord's service and put in the average of 4.2 hours each week, it will amount </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to 082,800 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same is true of the auxiliary colporteurs. If we add Just 1/10 of an hour, just six minutes, to what was done last year, which was 10.4 hours, the 625 auxiliary colporteurs reporting each week could make a total of 341,250 hours. If they really put in their twelve hours each, which every one should average weekly, we would go away over that. Let’s keep pulling at that 12-hour mark. Many of them make it and do better, and that helps the average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same applies also to the pioneer colporteurs, who averaged much better in 1930 than in 1929. They put in 23.44 hours each week. If they add 3j minutes and bring this up to 23} hours each week for 1931, one thousand pioneer colporteurs would put in 1,222,000 hours during the year. Adding the totals of the class workers, pioneers and auxiliary colporteurs, we find that the grand total is 2,540,050 hours. This is equivalent to nearly 291 years, three centuries, for one worker. That is a long time. If each worker and colporteur gives 4 testimonies each hour, and 2.546,050 hours are put in during the year, then it will be an easy matter for us to reach our quota, which is 10,000,000 l.esii monies. Think of it I At the end of 1931 you will have </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">spoken to </span><span class="font2">1/H </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of the population of the United States!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With these hard times and depressing coudi Hons among the people, there is one thing that the Lord's people cun do, and that Is, cull from door to door and explain to the people the Kingdom and its blessings. The definition of a testimony was given in the last </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin. </span><span class="font2">We hope that all will buve this clearly in mind, so that their reports will be accurate. New workers slips are being prepared by the Society, and these will enable each worker to keep track of his testimonies and the result of each one. During the coming year let every one make an earnest effort to report to the director the number of testimonies. or if you are a colporteur, report them on your weekly report card to this office. If </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10,000,000 </span><span class="font2">testimonies ure given during the coming year, the books are bound to be placed, because some will be waiting for the truth, being prepared in advance by the wonderful radio arrangement of broadcasting the troth. We feel sure that there will be an increase in the distribution of the literature. In addition to the 10,000,01.10 testimonies given by the workers, the radio will most likely reach mauy millions more during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Au estimate has also been made of what the Society believes we may expect to place along the line of books and booklets for the year, but we are not setting this as a quota. We believe, however, that you will be interested in knowing our calculations. Of course, the Society must make some plans and arrangements and try to determine in advance the number of books and booklets we hope to place with the people, so that contracts can be made with the paper manufacturers, cloth makers, and other manufacturers, in order to get the lowest possible prices on materials used. This will permit the making of the books at the lowest cost. In considering the distribution of books and booklets you must keep in mind that the Society has made n new arrangement as to the price of the books for the year 1.931. Another article in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font2"> goes a little more into detail in regard to this splendid provision which the Lord's organization has made for the benefit of the public. Having these prices in mind, then, we believe that the class workers, 4,500 brethren organized for</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Don’t Forget Your 100-Pound Order</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">We still find that quite a few </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the class directors and colporteurs who place orders with the Society sent! in orders for less than a hundred pounds. We are glad to say, however, that within the last six or eight months there has been a great improvement and these cases are becoming fewer. The classes aud colporteurs ran greatly help the Society in maintaining the new reduced rates which were made, and which go into effect January 1, by placing orders for a hundred pounds of hooks, or more, each time. Always keep In mind that we can send a hundred pounds of freight to you just as cheaply as we can send fifty, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sixty or seventy pounds, because freight rates are based on a hun</span><span class="font2">service in different cities, will place 700,000 clothbound books, as well ns 1,000.000 booklets. The auxiliary colporteurs, we believe, will place during the year 1931, 240,000 cloth-bound books and 350,000 booklets. The pioneers, it is estimated, will place 1,300,000 clothbound books and 1 &lt;100,000 booklets. The total number of clothbound books which will probably be placed in the United States during the fiscal year 1931 should be 3,240,000, and booklets 3.350,000, making a grand total of 5,590,000 books and booklets. But then, if we can do better, we will do it, won’t we?</span></p>

So the prospects are very </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have covered almost, everything now as to the details of the year's work and what, by the Lord's grace, we hope to do. Let each one of the anointed put his shoulder to the wheel ami ‘help push the chariot up Zion's hili'. Every additional hour put in the field will assist wonderfully in doing this. From time to time, however, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> will bring to you the different special drive weeks that have been arranged. We do not want to mention here the names or dates of these drive weeks, because wc are going to have a very attractive calendar this year, and you will find it all outlined on that calendar. But we will say at this time that, the first drive week of the year will be from January 31 up to and including February 8. Tills week is going to be called “Midwinter Week”, and Is outlined in detail in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin. </span><span class="font2">Do riot forget to put your order in for the new calendar, so that you will he posted regarding these special weeks, which bring such a tremendous amount of joy to you at different times during the year. Our hope is that every one of the Lord’s anointed throughout the earth will make every effort during this coming year to honor the name and word of Jehovah as they have never done before; and it should be the earnest desire of every one to press on, fighting for the Lord's kingdom with the whole heart, mind, soul and strength.

Last year alone we could have shipped two carloads of freight absolutely free if all the friends bad ordered books and booklets in hundred-pound lots instead of ordering fifty or sixty pounds at a time. In other words, we had to pay freight on two carloads of books which we did not ship. Had all cooperated, this needless expense would have been saved for the Kingdom work.

Some tuny wonder at a special service week's coming in the heart of winter; but why should God’s people, of all people, eease from fultill-iug their divine commission because of the seasons, especially when the Bible gives the assurance tiiat. neither winter nor anything else will stop the onward flow of God's river of life-giving water. Unlike other rivers, which freeze up in the wintertime, the I,ord has truly foretold that “in that day . . . living waters shall go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the former sea. and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer und in winter shall it be”. (Zech. .14:8} Jehovah foreknew that “in that day&quot;, which has already begun, his people would be willing to &quot;preach the gospel in season and out of season”, and that in winter or summer they would be joyfully inviting 'those who hear', ‘those who thirst' and “whosoever will” to come and take of the wafer of life freely. When one considers that more than led radio slatinns in this country alone are broadcasting the Kingdom message each week, raising their voices together and together singing the same message, and the thousands of class workers, sharpshooters, pioneer and auxiliary colporteurs who are bearing the same lifegiving message to the people throughout the earth, stopping neither for winter nor for summer, one can better realize that we actually are living “in that day” long ago foretold when the opportunity<sup>7</sup> to partake of the living waters would be given to all regardless of seasons. No wonder the prophet of old in ecstasy exclaimed, “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him tiiat. brlngelh good tidings, that publisbeth peace!” (Isa. 52:7) It gives us a thrill of joy, therefore, to announce this Midwinter Week, liecause we know how enthusiastically those who really love the lx?rd will respond, and the blessings that will come to them because they do. Because of this assurance in God's Word, we are looking forward to many testimonies’ being given to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">hast year the anointed put forth a special effort during the last week of January with the book J’rop/tecj/. The results were very encouraging. This year the plan for Midwinter Week is to offer the people the new $1.00 combinations which are io be made up of any three of the books </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance, Creation, Reconciliation, Government, Life, </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font2"> or of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Books </span><span class="font2">One and Two) and four booklets. It Is suggested that each worker canvass with the entire set of nine hooks and booklets, offering each one the opportunity of making his own selection of the particular </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">combination desired. By presenting all the books, the entire set is displayed; </span><span class="font2">and if real interest is shown, the worker is hi a good position to explain that six hooks may be had for $1.95, or all nine for $2.90. But bear In mind that special stress should be placed on the $1.00 combinations. We believe tiiat this amount will be more within the reach of the majority of the people at this particular time of the year than a larger combination of books. If the $1.00 combination is not desired, then drop to four booklets for 25c. Bemetnber that, as our commission is to preach the Kingdom gospel, a record is to be kept of the number of testimonies given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That week being in the middle of winter, service directors should begin to map out their territory early, so that, if possible, there will be plenty of territory to work in apartment houses, dwellings over stores, or homes with vestibules, enabling the workers to be out of the cold or inclement weather as much as possible. It would be well for each service committee to actually' go over the ground which is to be covered, to see that, it Is the best available for meeting these conditions, In order that the workers can spend as much time ns possible in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It has come to our attention that during these special service weeks some of the classes have arranged canvassing parties which meet and have lunch prepared for them nt the home of one of the friends. In some eases elaborate meals have been prepared, thus taking out of the field service many of the workers who have had to work hard nil morning to prepare the food and all afternoon to clean up. This has encouraged some to come out to eat, and sit around and talk, giving more attention to the social end than to the field service. While it is not the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fiutletiu’x</span><span class="font2"> desire to criticize, we suggest that instead of making sueb elaborate social occasions it would lie far better that each one bring his own lunch or that a few simple things be prepared. Let the real purpose of the work be kept in mind. Those who do not have the strength to return to the field work In the afternoon, after having been out all morning, should go home and rest up so that they may have the strength to go out the next day, rather than sit around and visit for several hours.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and Credit Memos</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Colporteurs and Classes Should Check Monthly Statements</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some of the colporteurs und classes have written to us asking why they have not received a credit memo in acknowledgment of remittances sent in together with their orders. If they will look nt the bottom of Ilie invoice for stn-li orders, they will find this acknowledgment. Only when remittances are sent in alone or merely with subscriptioTis are they acknowledged on credit memos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The invoices and credit memos should be kept and checked back </span><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is the greatest privilege that any creature could possibly enjoy; and when Jehovah through his organization arranges that a special effort be put forth at any time, it is really important that all those who are in line for the Kingdom and wish to show forth his praises consider such arrangements carefully and prayerfully to see that he Is using Ids time and strength to best advantage,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">26 Years in Colporteur</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Service and Still Going</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have just, read an interesting letter from a brother who has been in the colporteur work for yours. It was so encouraging to us that we thought you would like to read part of it. He says: “I am now 80 years old and In good physical condition, and still in the colporteur service, in which I have been for 2t5 years. I thank our dear Lord for this privilege of service. I will now make a radical change in which I expect to leave here after Christmas for------, and will stay in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">service there until death takes me for my reward.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Such a spirit of devotion to the Lord and Ills cause is conclusive proof that the Lord has some on the earth who think more of him and proving their integrity to him than they do of a life of case und comfort. Eighty years old, in good health, and all this after twenty-six years in the colporteur work! That's u record few can equal. And the best part of it .all is that he’s just as determined now as he was twenty-six years ago, if not more so, to stick to the finish. When you behold such devotion, is there auy doubt in your mind that the Lord is “gathering out a people for his name&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Report Light</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> Book One and Book Two, is a two-book combination. When </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> Book One nnd Book Two, is placed with an individual, it is to be reported on the class weekly report and workers' weekly report slip under the respective headings, and is also to be reported as a two-book combination. .Some of the directors tire failing to report </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> Book One and Book Two, as n two-book combination. These are also to be reported as two books when included in a placement with other books. For illustration: If </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> (Books One and Two) are placed, they constitute a four-book combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">with the monthly statement, to see that all entries have been iiutde correctly. Compare the date and number with those appearing on the statement, as well us the amount If you have invoices and credit memos for December and have just received your November statement, do not expect to see December transactions on your November statement. Considerable undue correspondence has been caused by inquiries regarding siieli matters. The monthly statement shows only the transactions during the current month for which the statement is issued, added to the previous balance of the account. Any transactions occurring after the last day of that month will appear on the next month’s statement.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Correspondents</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">We are continually receiving mail fi-oiii service directors, service treasurers, colporteurs ami sharpshooters in which the only thing in the envelope in a money order or check. Usually these brethren put their mime on the outside of the envelope ; that is the only way we have of knowing where it conies from. They do uot say what is to be done with the check, whether it is for Good Hopes, for radio fund, or for their account. This causes considerable confusion and work. We would ask that, each one sending any remittance to ilils oilice send an accompanying letter stating whirl is to be done with the money. Be sure that your letters are always addressed to the proper department, .ll.-uiy rimes colporteur correspondence is held up because it is not addressed to the colporteur department. Therefore, in order Licit we may cooperate most effectively in magnifying the name of Jehovah nt this time, see that, each letter you forward is addressed to whatever department you intend it to be for. Another point is that much of the mail coming to this office does not contain the address of the party writing the letter, making it necessary to search through Watch Tower tiles in order to ascertain the address before we can answer tlie correspondence. Each letter should contain, in the upper right band corner, the address of the party writing the letter. Tills also will save considerable work and confusion.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>How to Report Time</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Koine of the classes and colporteurs have been confused regarding the method for reporting the time spent in witnessing. When an individual goes out into Ilie service, he should begin to reckon his time from the moment he nuikos his lirsi call until the last one is completed, tn king time out for lunch, of course, if lie is out over this period. The only exception to this rule is in the case of canvassing parlies which meet together at some central point and tlien leave for the territory. In such cnees only, the time each worker puts in begins to count nt the moment the party leaves the place of meeting until he individually completes his last call. Tn such cases the time of the driver of the car should also he reckoned provided he makes a reasonable number of calls, by which Is meant that, ho does not merely go out to drive the car mid does not puss by his opportunities </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">doing </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">some of </span><span class="font2">the witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Watch Tower and Golden Age Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The office would appreciate it very much if the director, when sending in subscriptions for 77m IV’rifrti </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tv,’ter</span><span class="font2"> nnd </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> would kindly write them all out on Watch Tower or Gulden Age slips. It will assist iw in keeping tt proper check if (Ite names of the subscribers, forwarded by the directors, are listed In their letters when transmitting the subscriptions to us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">We believe thill the manner in which the Lord used his people during the past year is going to be an inspiration io each one who is of l lie anointed. That the great God of Ilie universe should condescend to use human creatures in 1he vindication of his name and giving si witness to the people regsirdiiig what lie is going to do, should thriil the heart of each one who is thus honored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Through his Word he says, “My son, be wise, and make my heart glud, that 1 may answer him that reproacheth me,” The Devil has been reproaching the heavenly Father for centuries, lie raised an issue which never should have been raised, namely, whether the great Jehovah God is worthy of the love anil allegiance of his creatures. Jehovah is the Giver of every good and perfect gift. 'Those who have been taken into the covenant for the Kingdom and lune tasted of ins goodness know this to be true. Jehovah says that it is possible for these to make his heart glad by being wise (tiie fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom). Therefore, fear of displeasing Jehovah, and obedience to Ills commands now, is really being wise, and following thia course brings joy to Jehovah because it proves that lie can place upon the earth a few individuals who will maintain theii' integrity under any and every test the Devil brings upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the past year Satan has used every power at his command to turn the people away from God. lie has caused oppression of every description. Unoinploymoiit is prevalent throughout the country, causing intense suffering from want of food and clothing among the poor people. Many of the Lord’s people who were dependent for tlieir sustenance on some one of the branches of worldly occupations have been thrown out of employment. They have diligently searched for something tii do and are unable to tind it. We are wondering if the Lord is not permiiling this particular condition in order Io awaken some of his people who are able to devote their time and energy to his servlet' but who instead of so doing have been using their energies in some branch of Sa I nil's organization. Many of the Lord's people spend days, weeks, and even months, going all over Iho country trying to tind employment in some worldly pursuit, overlooking entirely the fact tiuil every ll'idcli J’oircr and practically every </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hniietiii.</span><span class="font2"> issued by the Society calls attention to the provision I lie Lord Ims for the employment: of Ids people iiutv. The Lord tolls us Unit &quot;the steps of a I good man are ordered of the Lord, and lie delignteth in his way’’. Again, God's prophet says. &quot;I Imve been young, sml now ;im old: yer have I not .seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.” i And lignin. Lo says, Trove me now herewith, saitli Jehovah, ami see if I will not pour out upon you a blessing such as you will not be able to hold.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Surely the time has come when each oue who is a part of God’s family- and of his anointed should take the Lord at his word, instead of permitting Satan to keep them inactive or divert their energies to some branch of his organization. They should realize the fallacy of depending upon that thing which is an abomination to the Lord and will be utterly wiped out root and brunch. &quot;Seek ye tirsl. the kingdom of God, and bis righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you.” We are convinces! that if many of the friends will do this tlieir blessing and joy in Ilie service and the Lord's provision fur their temporal needs will Ite such that they will never again return to .secular employment but wi'l continue joyfully in the Lord's service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to help all who wish to participate in any branch of the Lord's .service, we are enumerating in tins </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jftilleiin</span><span class="font2"> the different provisions the Lord is making through the Society for participating in the Kingdom work. The first and great objective of every one of God’s anointed should be, if possible, to have all his time spent in the Lord’s service. In order that such might be able to enjoy the blessing of giving tlieir entire time and strength in singing forth his praises, the Lord has opened rip the pioneer colporteur service. To ail whose chief aim in life is to magnify the name of Jehovah, Ilie pioneer colporteur service offers them a wonderful opportunity. No one, however, should enroll with the idea that tills is a loafer’s job. Experience has shown that the Lord’s blessings are on those who are diligent, in the service, those who are ou the job regularly each day, the same as they would be if working at some secular employ men I.. The requirement for pioneer colporteurs is fall time in the service, averaging at least 15 hours a week in netirnl canvassing. 'Plris Is not the maximum, but is the very lowest, one may do to continue in 1lie pioneer service; mid unless one feels that this average can be maintained, we do not believe that the pioneer service should be attempted. For those who are desirous of availing themselves of this, the Society has made special arrangements to curry part of the burden by offering to those who are duty enrolled as pioneer colporteurs the privilege of obtaining literature at less than cost. TIio.se who wish Io enter this branch of the service, please write the Colporteur Department for further information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For those who eannot give their entire lime to the Lord's service, because of infirmities or because they find tlmt they must devote some time to secular employment in providing for Scriptural dependents. there is the auxiliary service. The auxiliary service requirements are 12 hours each week in door-1 o-diHsr field service. Auxiliary colporteurs may work in conjunction with tiie local ecclesia or, if they are isolated, they may receive an assignment of territory direct, from this oilice. To help those who enter tills branch of the service to meet, their expenses while in the work special rates are also granted, which may be hud upon request. There are still other friends who are living in Isolated sections of the country and not associated with any eeelcsia, or some who may be associated with an ccclesia but the ecclesia is not organized for service. We recommend to such tlmt if there are four or more friends in the class who can devote n reasonable amount of time to service work each week, they should arrange to organize into a service class, with a service organization of director, stockkeeper, and, IC the class is large enough, a service treasurer, so that they can unitedly cooperate in magnifying the name of Jehovah and declaring the purposes of his Kingdom. Where there are fewer than four who can reasonably be expected to participate in the service work the Society tins provided a sharpshooter arrangement, so that an individual, either brother or sister, who is able to engage in house-to-house witness work for on average of two hours a week may be enrolled as a sharpshooter and receive literature, bulletins and regional director visits the same as the organized classes. If there are two ot three in the class who can average between them two or more hours a week they may appoint one .of the friends ns sharpshooter, and the account will be opened in that Individual's name, and territory assigned and books shipped to them, and each one ean do what lie is aide in the way of service, receiv-</span></p>

We wore members of a church and all the while there was uo comfort there; so we were praying and asking God to show us tiie light. So we know now tlmt on Sept. 30, 1930, God did answer our prayer, and now we understand and know the truth of God and his great, love. Oh, it means so much to us at this time: because last April we gave our little girl up, and now we understand just how we are going to meet her and that it will net be long! Although we have had ihe hooks only six weeks, we have learned a wonderful lot from God’s Word wiili Hie aid of the books. We can't thank you enough for your effort and that you have been willing for God to use yon in this wonderful work, arid I am praying that the Devil will never lie able to squeeze in on your work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Further details covering all the branches of service mentioned above will be gladly supplied by writing to the Service Department or the Colporteur Department. Each one of the above branches of service requires regular reports from those who participate in it. All colporteurs and classes are required to report once a week, regularly, and sharpshooters are required to report once a month, showing the literature plated and the number of workers par 11 ci puling in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesm.1 made I Ida statement: “Ilerfs in is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit.” The bearing of fruit means carrying to others the life-sustaining fruit of the Kingdom, which is the truth concerning God and his purposes. All who really love God are anxious to increase their opportunities of bearing this fruit because it vindicates the name of Jehovah, it gives a witness concerning the purposes of Jehovah, and it brings Lope and peace lo the heart s of those who receive it as of the Lord. Surely, then, every one will want to avail himself of one of these branches of the service.

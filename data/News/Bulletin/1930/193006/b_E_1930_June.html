<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Anointed to Put In</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">With a Holiday, Two Saturdays, and Two Sundays, We Can Do It</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For years the Society fins been setting aside special weeks for making extraordinary effort to witness to the mime of the only true God. Again we have the pleasure of announcing that, another unusual week has been outlined for July </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font5"> to 13, The friends throughout the world at all times see the necessity of putting out the Kingdom message, for ‘tills Kingdom Gospel must be preached in ail the world for a witness'. We have called tills week the “150,000-hour week” because nil the workers will be putting In time for the Kingdom. The Lord told his disciples to go and preach the same message that he preached, and during these 150,000 hours ihe anointed in this country will go and preach. If wc put in the time, and take with us the literature that the Lord has provided through his organization. we are bound to leave this . comforting message In thousands of homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Looking at some of our past records, we find that the friends have gone forward with great energy in midwinter. During the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy </span><span class="font5">i drive class workers, pioneers and I auxiliary colporteurs put in t&gt;0,400 : hours. During the Mudies </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">hi the </span><span class="font5">i </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture*</span><span class="font5"> drive they put in IJ5.G53 hours. During IBSA Week in May, 1929, all the anointed in this country put in 114,550 hours, and daring September IBSA Week spent 124,-498 hours in the field service. But during the last IBSA Wi-ek we pul in only 110,115 hours. We fell short a little. Now we have come to a time in the year when tiie weather </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">1b</span><span class="font5"> warm, but not too warm. Shall we go up a liltle- say 40,000 hours more? It is a pleasure to be out in the open in God’s country, where he slrows forth ills handiwork. During the ten days beginning with July 4 it is planned to work in small towns especially, and the outlying rural territory of these towns. When</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>“Time” Witnessing</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">we slop to think of it, 150,000 hours is &quot;an awful long time”, if one person were to use it nil, but the Lord has provided that there should be a “remnant” in the earth in “the last days” and that all these should put forth their every effort to honor his name. Do you think you can make the 150,000 hours? We are all going to help to get the right answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why not look at it this way? July 4 is a holiday, n day in winch American people celebrate the birth of tins nation, but it is a day when the Lord’s anointed are going to announce the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">iie.te</span><span class="font5"> nation : the Kingdom of Christ on </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">earth.</span><span class="font5"> ITnetically alt the friends will have n holiday on this occasion, and, as it falls on Friday, most of them will be able to lie free on Saturday also. Thus many groups will be able to arrange for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Friday, Saturday and Sunday </span><span class="font5">canvassing drives in some outlying town of tbelr territory, lie re are three whole days which the friends will be able to devote to service. We hope that most of the friends will be able to arrange their vacation so ns to cover the whole period of this 150,000-hour week. If not, at the end of the. week we have another Saturday afternoon and a Sunday. During ibis whole period there is “daylight-saving time&quot; in many parts of the country, enabling class directors to arrange for canvassing parties for evening work. It is light until 8.30 or 9, and even cities that do not have daylight-saving time can arrange these drives, as well as parties throughout the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now then, if all the pioneer colporteurs would put in an average of live hours a day for ten days, it would amount to 5&lt;i hours each for this special week. Why not let every pioneer make 50 hours his quota for ‘‘150,000-IJour Week?&quot; But we will count on 1100 pioneer colporteurs’ putting in about 44 hours as an average, and wo hope that each one will have plenty of territory, plenty of books, and lots of energy, by the time this special week begins. This little army going forth and making an assault upon the Devil’s organization will be able to put in around 48,500 hours for the new King and Kingdom. The auxiliaries, by each one’s putting in 2'Xi hours a day for ten days, would make a total of 25 hours each for the week for their quota. At present there are about 750 auxiliaries; and these, by working as a unit against the Devil and ids crowd and averaging 22 hours for tlic week, would total 10.500 hoars for this week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During these special weeks many of the anointed see more clearly the importance of getting into Ute field, and, as past records have shown, several thousand more get Into the field than at other times. We anticipate that during this week 8,500 class workers will put in at least regular auxiliary time, 12 hours a week, for their quota; but wc hope that, when averaged, it will be at least 10 hours. This, then, for ten days, would make a tolal of 85,000 hours. This great army of workers, great in zeal for the Lord and his Kingdom, but not in number, only 10,350, will, during this period of time, put in 150,1X16 hours of actual witnessing to the people, in their homes, out in Ilie field, in factories, in officee—everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Arrangements have been made to have the factory, oiliee and Bethel home closed for the first three days of this drive, so that the Bethel family can go forth as a unit with the rest of the anointed In this great effort to leave a witness in the earth that Jehovah is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some friends say that they cannot place books with the people, but none can say that they cannot put in some time preaching the gosjiel of the Kingdom. And, lifter all, that ts the main thing the Lord wants us to do. ‘Ye are my witnesses that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am God,' Let us, every one, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“CLEAR TIIE DECKS,” </span><span class="font5">get ready and be prepared to do tmr part in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“150,000-HOUR WEEK,” JULY 4 TO 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“THERE’S A REASON.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You love the Lord above everything </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">else in life.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Bethel Family to Have Big Part in Week</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Leaders</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to Be Sent to Classes</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Factory and Office Will Be Closed Friday and Saturday,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 4 and 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The members of the Bethel family are anxious to get into this big midsummer week of witnessing. They are always eager to get into the field service and tell forth the message of tiie Kingdom, as well as to prepare it by making the books. During May IBSA Week the members of the Bethel family put out over S,OClO hooks and booklets. They averaged 42 pieces of literature each. They had a happy time in Ilie field work and are looking forward to having an even greater share in file coming special effort, and also expect an even greater blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tiie Service Department will be glad to send service leaders to any organized class upon request, within n radius of 500 miles of Brooklyn, These brethren will leave Thursday evening and be ready to co gage In the service work on 'Friday morning, cooperating with the friends in the field work during these three days. They will be prepared lo lead meetings on Friday and Saturday evenings, and also Sunday afternoon at four o’clock. You had bell er get in your request, early, otherwise you might be missed. Organized classes within a radius of 150 miles will be served from Bethel in the latter end of the drive. The brethren will leave some time Saturday and conduct a service meeting Saturday evening, engage in tiie field work Sunday and give a service talk Sunday evening. AU desiring such appointment should address a request to the Service Department.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">However, the canvassing of rural territory and small towns effectively and efficiently requires the most careful planning. In the majority of cases when these towns and byways are canvassed, either a part of the territory is left undone, due to insufficient number of workers, or there arc* so many workers that they clean up tbe territory in half the time that is allotted for working and the rest of the time is spent sitting around doing nothing. Then</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">it best to work during that season of the year? In the outskirts of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">fully planned and executed it can be made the most successful drive of all to date. Therefore, let us make a careful analysis of the facts that we have to contend with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first problem to be considered is, &quot;How are we going to get to tlie people?&quot; During the period from July 4 to 6 particularly, we may find them a little elusive, but they do not get off this old planet of ours; they are somewhere here on earth, and it is our dutv to get to as many of them as possible under the most favorable circumstances that we ean. Now then, where are they most likely to be found at that time? There are a large number who will go to the seaside and mountain resorts; another large crowd will be found on the golf course, and still another running arouiid in their autos wondering if they are going to have gas enough to carry them home; while there are still others who go to the country, their desire being to get back to the. old farm or homestead, away from the. glare and glamour of the city, and enjoy Hie peace of living in surroundings close to nature, and in many cases with those who tire near ami deal- to them; and there are still others who crtimol, or will not for one reason or another, leave the city during this period. This in a genera! way subdivides tlie people for us during ttie holiday portion of our drive week. The next thing to do is to determine which of these classes are going to be tlie most likely prospects tor the Kingdom message. The crowd who attend the beaches and golf courses and those who are running around in their tin lizzies, looking for some place to go, are perhaps out of the question. They are not in a mental altitude that tlie Kingdom message will appeal to. This leaves us those who remain in the city for one reason or another, anil those who return to the small country town or the farm, as our best prospects for the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">out fifty to seventy miles each day to canvass remote sections of their territory, and arrange for them to return that evening. This means the wasting of five or six hours driving forth to the territory and back. Such practices should be eliminated, and can be eliminated by a careful consideration of the details. The apostle, referring to this, in his exhortation to the Chris Li an, says, “[Be] not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.” A slothful person is one who is stow, tardy, Indifferent and negligent. The child of God when about Ids Father’s business should not be in this condition. Therefore let the service committee arrange now to get their map, population data, and other iu-fornuilion Incidental to effectively working their territory, and plan carefully bow the territory Is going to be worked during this drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I Arrangements should be made for the cars, where they are .going Io be allotted, and efficient brethren in each town and rural section to direct the details of working the assignment. Arrangements should be made for convenient supply depots in every territory, cither in ears or iu some stove or home ceiilrully located, so that the workers may be able to get their literature without spending a lol of time trying to replenish their stock. It is careful</span></p>

<div>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Many Find It the Best Time</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">During recent years the anointed have come to realize that Sunday Is the best day for canvassing. This does not just happen to be that way. It is bused upon certain competent causes. People have relaxed from their business affairs; they are in a frame of mind to give consideration to other things than their business; all the family are usually at home and can be interviewed, and thus we get away from the excuse .so often made by the wife that she has to discuss the matter with her husband, or the husband’s excuse that the wife looks after all that feature of the family's welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The same competent causes that apply to Sunday* and make it the best day of the week for canvassing apply with the same force to evening canvassing. We have long evenings before it gets dark, purlieu-1 iarly in sections where daylight-1</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">saving time is in effect, mid therefore, particularly during I USA Week, an effort should be made to use tiffs time for house-to-house canvassing, anil it will be found that the same results can be obtained as you obtain in Sunday work. Those who have really slanted tilts, feature of the work do not want to give it up for any other time in the week, except Sunday, because of the results they obtain. One colporteur writing in this connection says. &quot;The late service letter is very encouraging. The eleventh hour (5 o'clock p.m.) is very sign Hi cant. After 5 p.m. (5 to 8) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in the best </span><span class="font5">time of day for canvassing. I make most of my sales nt homes after 5, except Sunday forenoon.” Therefore we heartily recommend that during the entire summer this method be tried out in Iho classes. Commencing with IBSA Week, give it a fair and impartial trial ami you will bo astounded at tbe results.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">May IBSA Week the Best Ever</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Didn’t Put In as Many Hours as Last Year. Why?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">On April 27 the greatest IBSA Week ever held began. Hue to the big radio hook-up, which took place on the following day, many of the workers used Saturday for the distribution of the radio announcements, which, of course, cut down on the number of hours devoted to the canvassing work for the week. But in spite of this the number to respond to the call to service was so substantially greater than heretofore that last year’s high total of 262,550 pieces of literature was surpassed by 10,282. Yes, sir; the gratid total for the TBSA Week just passed was actually 272,841 books and booklets! The reason for this large total Is found In the fact that 10,089 workers participated In the drive. While the goal of 300,000 was not quite reached, 272,841 Is really a remarkable attainment, and surpasses in tta grand total every other IBSA Week. Therefore there is every reason for rejoicing in the way in which the Lord 1ms sent forth his truth. Sonic have felt that on account of the hard times it is impossible to place books; but who can continue Io hold to this view in the face of these figures? Surely Jehovah is not going io permit Satan to keep his Kingdom Gospel from being preached because of financial distress which Satan has brought upon the people. Jesus says that this Kingdom gospel must be preached. Therefore, in spite of all obsl aeles and ditlieullies, tlie witnesses of the Lord will continue to sing forth his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some may think tluit 300.000 books and booklets are more than could reasonably be contempbitisl ; but a glance nt the above figures will show how it might have been accomplished. You will recall that this year there was a day added to the campaign, it being for a period of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">nine</span><span class="font5"> days instead of the eight of 11129. But even with this addilional lime, the total number of hours which the classes devoted to the actual canvassing dropped from 63,010 to (11,-431, exclusive of the auxiliary colporteurs. With tin increase of 1,337 workers over hist year's, the average number of hours per worker in the service dropped from 8.93 to 7.33. If the class workers had maintained the same average nuiulier of hours as last year and had for this additional time phicod the same number of books and booklets an hour as they did during the 61,431 hours they worked this year, what would have been the result? Instead of their grand total literature distributed being 157,364, it would have amounted to 194,518. By adding to this the books and booklets placed by the pioneer and auxiliary colporteurs the grand total would have surpassed the 300,000 mark by 9,991 I We bring this to your attention to show how important </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">lime</span><span class="font5"> is in placing the Kingdom message in . the bands of the people. Bad weath-er in the West and Southwest had i a lot to do with this decrease in the nunilier of hours. Many of the classes worked longer and harder than ever, and as a result enjoyed a special blessing from the Lord.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Everyone will rejoice as do we, in tlie way in which the classes among tlie foreign-speaking brethren in the United Slates have responded during this IBSA Week. Tn spite of the difficulties which they have to meet in giving the witness, they re-iwrted 2,158 workers purl leipntiiig. This shows that there is an opportunity to sing forth tlie Lord’s praises for nil who desire to lake advantage of their opportunities. These brethren placed a total of 35,808 pieces of literature. While they averaged only 6% hours a week in tlie work, we are very much encouraged by the way in which they have responded, and hope that they will keep up the good work to tlie honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And as for the sharpshooters, they too were right there on the job, 213 answering “Here” to the roll call by sending in their reports for tlie week; and tlie final figures showed that they averaged 11 hours iu the lield, placing 5,890 pieces of literature. That's great, sharpshooters!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Colporteurs Do Good Work</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">We want to congratulate the colporteurs also for the good work which they have done during this drive. You know that several years ago it was taken for grunted that tlie colporteurs would be working the same as usual during IBSA Weeks; but, after having kept a special record of their efforts, it has been found that they too have rejoiced in working harder during these times just to show tlie Lord that they delight in singing forth his praises. The 1.018 pioneers reporting averaged 34.28 hours each in tlie work, as compared with 32.81 hours during May, 1929; and the 693 auxiliaries increased their average from 18.51 hours to 19.90. That’s</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font5">just splendid, and we rejoice with you in the blessings which were yours as a consequence. The additional number of hours given to tlie work meant, of course, an increased amount of literature distributed. Tlie number of pioneers participating in the work was actually 32 less than that of the previous May, but the total literature distributed showed an increase of 1,960. As for the auxiliaries, there were 219 more participating this year than last, placing 6,829 more pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Hard Times</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Not Stop Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another very encouraging feature of this report is the fact that the hard times among the people have not nniteriiilly affected the work of tlie pioneer colporteurs. While the average number of hours given in the work increased 1.47 over IBSA Week of May 1929, the average number of bound books decreased only 1.01 jier colporteur. This, however, was offset by the big jump taken in the number of 10-cent booklets. Ilie average per colporteur increased 9.16. The two new booklets, Crimes </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and Calamities</span><span class="font5"> and Tt’ar or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace,</span><span class="font5"> arrived just in time to be effective in this week’s activities; and the large increase in tlie proportion of booklets ns compared with books gives evidence of flic fact that the friends had a good time in showing them to the people. This large increase Is further explained in the fact that many of the workers added the 9 booklets to their $2.40 set combination, making it a book-and-booklet set for $2.90. While we arc glad to see the increase tn the distribution of the booklets, we take this opportunity to remind tlie friends again of Ilie 10-pereent-discount arrangement on combinations of hooks and Iwoklets amounting to $1.50 or more. Unless the people are made acquainted with this special offer, they, of course, ciiunot realize tlie advantage of hiking books in combination. If all the workers keep this in mind and tell the people about it, wc are confident that It will result in the placing of more of the combinations of 3,4,5, 6 and 7 books together with booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When one reflects that five years ago, in September, 1925, when the first total of booklets as well as books was tabulated (lx?fore that time u record of books only was kept), the total literature distributed numbered only 55,978, and then look nt the grand total of 272,837 for this year, there is a real cause for rejoicing in tlie onward march of truth.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>$2.90 Combination Colporteurs’ Favorite </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Helps Place More Booklets</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">The suggestion offered hi the April </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font5"> of presenting the set of 7 books and 9 booklets for $2.90 Ims been tried by many of the colporteurs and class workers, with the most encouraging results. No doubt tlie big increase In the number of booklets placed during IBSA Week is the result of many having added the 9 booklets to their set combination. One colporteur writes us .the following letter nliout her success:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I have been encouraged by the recent </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins.</span><span class="font5"> I heartily endorse iho suggestion by tlie brother from Pennsylvania, that we obey every request that comes from headquarters. The Lord is directing his army, mid we can expect victory only us we obey commands and cooperate. When tlie suggestion was made that we on'er tlie nine booklets with the set, T doubted if I could place so many sets at the advanced price; but I nmdo the offer and find I place just as many sets and nearly three times as many booklets. I had been averaging about 40 booklets per week in the past, hut I now find I have placed about 500 booklets in the four weeks since including the booklets with tlie set. One man, wiih whom I had placed the. set including one booklet, was nt a home Where I placed the set including ah the booklets, and he wanted to know why he didn’t get nil those little books with his set. He took tlie other eight, for lie said lie enjoyed those more even than the larger ones.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These booklets have been prepared for the very purpose of in-lercsting the people in Hie Kingdom message. When a person hasn’t time to sit down and read a book, lie cun pick up a booklet and enjoy a taste of the good things the Lord has for him hi the bound volumes. How they whet the appetite for more is illustrated in the following experience by the sniue colporteur:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I called last week on n lady Hint said she wouldn’t be interested, as she had planned to order the books she desired to study. She brought me a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kextoration-, </span><span class="font5">said she had obtained that for only ten cents and it was tlie finest thing she had ever read, and she wanted to get all of Judge Rutherford's works. Of course I find no difficulty leaving the set with her.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Returning Literature</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">When returning books to Brooklyn or one of the depots, pack them as they are packed by us and seal all seams with sealing tape. When 1 Jie freight agent makes out the bill of lading, be sure that he writes the following on the bill of lading: &quot;The fibre boxes used for this shipment conform to the specifications ; set. forth in the hoxnmker’s certifi-i cnle thereon; and all other requirements of Rule 41 of the Consolidated freight Classification.” (Rule 41 Section S c} This Is necessary to | avoid paying a 20% penalty.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Encourages Some to Enter Colporteur Work</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">There Is continuing to be an ever increasing interest in the pioneer and auxiliary colporteur work as the Lord’s people are coming to see and appreciate more and more the Kingdom interest which the Lord has committed unto them. During IBSA Week a letter was mailed to the classes and colporteurs entitled “Go You Also into the Vineyard”. Each service director was instructed to see to it that all of those w<sup>r</sup>ho partook of Memorial received a copy because it contained a real message for all. If you didn't get your copy, sec the director nt once and ask him for one, Besides containing some encouraging words from the Bible, it quoted some valuable suggestions on how to make a success of the pioneer work from those who have been “sticking to the job” for years. A most interesting picture of a trailer built by one party of colporteurs was also given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the mailing of this letter the response has been most encouraging, for it has shown some just how to go about the work to make a success of it; by which is meant, to be able to continue without turning aside to something else. 132 have enrolled in the pioneer work and 107 have entered as auxiliaries. This is causing a steady increase in the colporteur enrolment list which now numbers 1235 pioneers and 902 auxiliaries. It is hoped that these will all be right at the forefront of the battle, reporting regularly each week, and enjoying the rich blessings which come with the happy realization that one Is fulfilling one's divine commission of preaching this Kingdom gospel.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Get Your Orders in Early</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Get vour orders in early for &quot;150,000-TIour Week”. Make them freight shipments of a hundred pounds or more. We appreciate very much tlie cooperation of the friends in placing 100-pound orders, for II has enabled us to avoid a good amount of mail and express expense. Freight, you know, is always cheaper than sending books either by mail or by express. We take this occasion to remind you again that the factory will be closed Thursday evening, July 3; so be sure to get your orders In early enough to enable us to ship them before that date. All colporteurs, pioneer and auxiliary, and stockkeepers and directors should now carefully check over their stock and place an order for a good supply of books and booklets to carry you through tins “150,000-Hour Week”. If you get them in early you will avoid the last-minute rush. Let us make this a perfect week in service organization: books on hand, territory laid out, and all arrangements made to get the friends to their territories with their books.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Due brother who has had considerable experience in the colporteur work sent us tlie following suggestion for canvassing with all the books among the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Many of the friends are handicapped by the pictures of Jesus in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, Reconciliation, The Harp </span><span class="font5">j </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of God,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font5"> when canvassing the Jews.

Cutting out the pictures or otherwise covering up the references to Jesus sometimes helps to place a set. but the prospect upon seeing these tilings later may be somewhat uneasy and not read the literature as freely as otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A .good remedy is to ‘turn the battle at tlie gate' by opening up at one of the pictures of Jesus, saying, ‘The Jewish people have been charged with tlie death of Jesus. But is this true? or was he put to death by the Ilouian soldiers? Tlie Jewish people have carried this burden for a long time. Here (pointing at the picture of Jesus) is the true story of his death.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“That at once covers up all the pictures of Jesus, as well as his sayings, and puts the Jews on friendly terms with any statements concerning him read in the books. I have found this the best method yet for placing the literature with the Jews.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Sharpshooters* Reports</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Apparently some of the sharpshooters became confused in reporting their February figures, some thinking that their report covering the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font5"> drive was all that was required. As a result we were short more than a hundred sharpshooters’ reports at the end of the month. We feel sure that this was not intentional neglect, but rather due to a misunderstanding. Therefore, we ask that on the first of each month each sharpshooter make out a monthly report covering the activities for the entire previous month, except where any special report has been made out covering IBSA Week and special drives, In which cases the monthly report should cover all other activities. Do this promptly on the first of each month and you will cooperate with ns greatly in keeping our records up to date and in enabling us to have a proper report of the field activities.</span></p>

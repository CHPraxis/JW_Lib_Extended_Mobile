<p><span class="font3">As outlined in the August </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hiillc-tin,</span><span class="font3"> IE cadi one does his part (luring this drive there is not the slightest doubt about attaining the 750,000 testimonies quota. The results of the 150,000-Hour Week are a clear indication that tlie anointed throughout the country have a keener appreciation of 1he issue than ever Iwfore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The books </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lAyht</span><span class="font3"> clarify many features of Hie great battle now impending and the significance of our activity in the Lord’s service in a way that we did not: previously appreciate. There mtiy be some who, when they rend </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">JAf/fit</span><span class="font3"> and see the significance of the various campaigns in the past in which they might have had a purl, but for one reason or another did not, will feel disappointed because they permitted something else to crowd out their privileges of service at that time; and it is unquestionably right that one should feel badly about missing any opportunities of service I hut the Lord aft'ords. The apostle says that “godly sorrow workelli repent-1 since unto salvation”, and one who ■ could have had a part in the Lord’s service and did not because of some negligence on his part would not have a proper appreciation of the Lord’s organization and bis part therein if he did not feel badly about losing these privileges. It is evident that as we approach closer to the great climax, when Jehovah himself will arise to give the great, witness, every privilege of service is fraught with greater responsibility and brings correspondingly greater blessings. Therefore it twliooves everyone who has been taken into the covenant for the Kingdom to give greater diligence than ever lie-fore. seeing to it that lie renders unto the Lord the things that are Ills by diligently watching the time and devoting his faculties to Ilia service. The 750,000 Testimonies Week is just what its name implies: a witness week wherein, by the Lord’s grace, it is expected that that many testimonies pertaining to Jehovah and the establishment of his kingdom will be given to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An analysis of I hose 750,000 testimonies is interesting. There are approximately 120,000,000 people in</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To the Workci's of the Lord’s Army,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dear Brethren in the Anointed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the 12th of June it was my pleasure to address a letter to you calling attention to the privilege of putting forth an extra effort during the service week beginning July 4. Your response thereto has been unusually good, and I rejoiee with each and every one of you in the splendid results. The blessing of the Lord attended the efforts of everyone who sought to serve him unselfishly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To exceed the quota is far better than to fall short, of it. You exceeded it this time. Service week was designated as 150,000-Hour Week, and here is a brief summary of the result</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">of the service during that week:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">A reasonable average would be to count ten discourses to each piece of literature, making a total of 3,355,030 discourses delivered in one week in the United States alone. For the Lord’s little army that is marvelous in our eyes; it is the doing of the Lord. I deeply appreciate the privilege of being associated with such dear, earnest and zealous workers in the cause of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of course opposition arises from time to time. The Lord could prevent this, but manifestly he permits it in order to call attention to the truth in a more striking way. Let no opposition discourage you. Go straight forward, bearing in mind always the words of Jehovah, “Ye are my witnesses that I am God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Beginning September 27 there will be another Service week, and it will be your privilege, with all others who join, to make this the best time of delivering testimony yet had. In the meantime you will have Books One and Two of LIGHT. Study them carefully, that you may understand and intelligently present the message to the people. Then may the Lord’s blessings attend you in a marked degree, resulting to his glory and praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Again be assured of my appreciation of your devotion to the Lord, and of the opportunity of serving with you. With much love and best wishes, I remain</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">During the last week of July and the first week of August the entire factory and office force has been working on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> putting in eleven hours a day—and, by the way, it is hot in New York. We wish you could see these boys working, and watch tlie sweat roll off of their brows, backs and arms. They are. giving all tins energy in the service of the Lord, and they believe the Lord wants their “heart, mind, soul and strength”. We feel sure this is pleasing to him. They are the happiest family on earth. We thought you would be interested if we told you what they have been doing during tlie first week of the extra-time work in the factory, and that it I would make your heart glad to know this. During the first week they' finished, on an average, 20,210 books and 37,851 booklets each day. In fact, one day they made 21,000 bound boolcs, breaking all previous records. ’This makes a total of 58,091. pieces of literature completed in eleven hours. As to the work accomplished in tliis one week, from July 2S to August 2, inclusive, there were produced at 117 Adams Street, 332,730 pieces of literature. They believe that that on which they are working it is ‘necessary to have done speedily’. We hope that during the 750,000 Testimonies Week tlie friends will place the books as fast as they were made here during these two weeks. Wo will be in that drive, too.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Everybody Did Splendidly</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Well, you did It, even though many of the friends may have had a little doubt in the back of their heads that it couldn’t be done. Nor do we blame them; for 150,000 hours is a lot of time. But the joyful part is that you beat that mark by 4,450 hours ’ Just look at the table of results if you want to see how it was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While we anticipated 8,500 might participate in the class work, even more than this joined the ranks, averaging 9.f&gt;8 hours each in the field. This was .42 of an hour less per worker than the 10 hours quota, resulting in the class workers’ coming short 1,723 hours of the 8o,00u goal. The 83,277 hours, though, which they did put in is so far in excess of all previous records for class workers that we are exceedingly joyful. Just look at the work done by the pioneers! Honestly, it thrills our hearts to see the way that they entered into this great work in singing forth the praises of Jehovah. You might think that those who are in the work nil the time would look at this week ns If it were nothing out of the ordinary. Not so with the pioneers. They are on the job because they love the Lord, and whenever the opportunity arises to demonstrate to the Devil and his crowd that they are 1OO-percent on the Lord's side, they respond with all their heart, soul, mind and strength. Instead of only 1,100 participating, 1,146 reported 52,559 hours, bettering the quota by 4,059 hours. This made the average time per colporteur mount up to almost 2 hours better than the 44.00 hours for the week that we hoped they would put in. Isn’t that splendid? To make an overage like that menus a lot of long hours by many of the pioneers to make up the short time of those who were handicapped by sickness, etc. To all the workers in the field who put forth the effort in un unselfish desire to magnify the name of Jehovah, we should like to say to you, God bless you, your labors are not In vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The auxiliaries were as anxious to do their part, too. The 750, the number of those who participated, corresponded exactly with the quota figure, but these pnt in so many more hours that we were really astounded. Their average time was 24.82 hours per worker during the 10 days, with n grand total of 18,614 hours. That’s just 2,114 hours better than the quota, and 2.82 hours better for each auxiliary. One auxiliary put in 72 hours during the 19 days. Adding nil branches of the work to</span></p>

Is additional information. gether, we have 154,450 hours devoted to preaching this Kingdom gospel which Jesus said must be preached as a witness. The Devil may have thought that he could discourage the remnant by his attack in Germany, but the faithful came back with the greatest counter attack, witnessing to more people than ever before in any similar period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a result of this tremendous effort, the IBSA Week quota of 300,000 books and booklets, which was not made nt that time, was surpassed during 150,(XX)-IIour Week by 35,493. Think of it I 335,493 books and booklets! This means not only that the hour quota was far surpassed, bitt that all previous records for books and booklets placed were smashed to smithereens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have been so keenly luter-ested in compiling these figures tliat when the final totals were obtained we felt like shouting with joy so that all could hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">150,000-Hour Week is in the past. While we rejoice In its accomplish meats, Jet this but arouse us to make 750,000 Testimonies Week a corresponding success.

<p><span class="font3">(Continued from page 1, column 3) the figures from the standpoint of families, we find the following : that there are 24,000,000 families in this country and that 750,000 testimonies means that we are testifying to one out of every 32 families in the United States in tilts nine days’ campaign. It is difficult for the mind to grasp the magnitude of the effectiveness of this witness. However, we feel confident in saying that there is not another organization or body of people on earth that would even think of starting such a tremendous work, and yet to no man or body of men is due any credit for it. It is the spirit of Jehovah God sent forth to .accomplish the good pleasure of ills will, operating in his people, that accomplishes this mighty work. This should create in the heart of every one of the Lord's anointed a reverent thankfulness for being used thus by Jehovah, and an intense desire to do that which is pleasing to him. The question each one should ask himself, and also each service committee similarly, is, Am I ready for the campaign? Have I seen that such advance preparations as can be made are being attended to now? Each one, if he finds that they are not attended to, should busy himself in seeing that he is prepared to enter whole-heartedly into this mighty drive to bear witness to the name of Jehovah and the establishment of his kingdom. Remember, five testimonies an hour as an average for every worker. A short, interesting testimony about, the Kingdom, and then let the books tell them Ilie rest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Leaders to Be Sent Out</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bethel family is having great pleasure in producing the new books </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibition</span><span class="font3"> booklet, and they are looking forward to an Interesting time in the field service work giving testimony to the people concerning God’s kingdom. When the 750,000 Testimonies Week rolls around, we will he in it. Brother Rutherford has decided to close I he factory and Bethel home during October 3, 4 and 5. so that every member of the family will have the privilege of engaging in th is great work of the kingdom.

<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>September Brings Joyful Labor Days</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3-Day Canvassing Parties</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The month of September is about the most nearly ideal month of the year for our work, lu fact, as far us field activity is concerned, September leads every other month. The intense heat is a tiling of the past, children have returned ro school, and parents are freer to go out during the daytime in the witness work than they are at any other time. The weather also is inviting. Therefore we feel .sure that September of this year is going to be as in former years, the best month that we have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Labor Day covers a period of three “off” days, inasmuch as .Saturday is half a holiday, and a whole holiday for many, Sunday will likewise be a holiday, and Monday, Labor Day, will be the third. This would prove an ideal time for the final big drive in the rtirals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Identification Card </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Never Be Rude to People </span><span class="font3">In many cases where the friends are stopped by local police officials the police claim that they do this because they are not certain that the friends are bona fide representatives of the Society. They claim that there i.s such a wave of lawlessness everywhere that they have to take this precaution and insist on stopping the friends until they have established the fact that they are really what they claim to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To overcome this difficulty and avoid the embarrassment that arises out of such circumstances, tlie Society is prinfing a neat identification cord signed by Brother Rutherford. This card identifies the worker and slates his mission. The cards will be sent to the classes on the basis of the number of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins </span><span class="font3">they are now receiving. Pioneer and auxiliary colporteurs and sharpshooters will receive their card filled out by this office. The director is to fill in the name of each worker in tlie space provided or have some other competent member of the class do so. The worker will then keep this card, and if he Is stopped he Is to use it as his means of identification as a representative of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">COURTESY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Reports come to the Society from time to lime that some of the field workers arc discourteous to the people. This is much to be regretted. The truth should be presented with courtesy and respect to all, and see to it that no one is personally rebuked or illtreated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The mere fact that it is oue’s privilege to tell the people the truth does not warrant one’s being discourteous. It injures the field for those who come afterwards, and Is not in keeping with the proper course of those who hear the testimony of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">thrilled in reading the new book, as you will be when you read it, and are anxious to offer these new publications to the people. We have set for ourselves a quota of 12,000 testimonies. It is going to take an earnest and hard effort on our part, to make it, but we are going after it. You too, are going to try to make the 750,000 Testimonies Week a big success, aren’t, you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Any class within a radius of 500 miles of New York city that desires to have a service leader sent to serve them for these three days, please write to the regional service department. These b rethren will lead the friends Into the field, and in the evening give them service talks.</span></p>

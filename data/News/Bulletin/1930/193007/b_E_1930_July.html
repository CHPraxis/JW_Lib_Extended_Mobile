<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Brother Rutherford’s Letter a Real Joy to the Anointed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">This </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> will reach you about the time .to Sturt out in what we anticipate will be the biggest onslaught against the enemy that the anointed have ever staged. And why do we believe, this? It is-because the Devil, in his effort to dishearten and discourage * the anointed and to hinder the Lord’s work, has raised the' real issue, for. . 150,000-Hour Week. God’s people tn'ust. reply. When tin issue is Hated squarely before them ns to where they stand, all those who really love the Lord respond with a thrill of joy and gladness. : . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>:</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An understanding of the events i leading up to this week reveals this । issue so■■ clearly that we are going' to tell you about it. So many of the friends throughout the country had been telling me how much joy they received from the other special service: weeks which have been held so far tills year that it was suggested arrangements be made to have another during the summer. It was pointed out that this would lie the most favorable time on account of good weather generally prevailing, many of the friends’ having more time for the work on account of vacations and long evenings in which to be ..out In the work, and the farmers' having something during the summer, either cash or their farm products, with which to obtain the books. Taking all these suggestions into consideration, and especially considering the impetus that such a week would give toward spreading the Kingdom gospel, it was decided io add another special service week, in which, the main stress would be upon </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">time.</span><span class="font4"> The name for -the week was announced as “150,000-IIour Week”, believing that each one is responsible for the amount of time Which he gives to the work, whereas he is not entirely accountable for the actual num tier of books be places. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The announcement stated, “There’s a reason”; and since then many have asked, &quot;What is this reason’r&quot; In making the statement the thought in mind was to give Coif’s people another opportunity to sing forlh the praises of. Jehovah. At that lime nothing was known .of the attack which Satan had planned against the Society’s funds. In Germany. Btlj: no doubt, the Lord knew what </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">hOAvas </span><span class="font4">tip </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to tind </span><span class="font4">permitted Satan’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">organization to steal the money, </span><span class="font4">much the same as lie permitted him to afflict Job. This is not si range when it is called to mind that Satan lias defied God to place a people upon the earth who will maintain their integrity and who will joyfully serve Jehovah if Satan be given a free hand. Ills open attack in Germany is anol her indication of his wrath against the remnant, and shows that the fight is on. Before God’s people is raised the issue, “Who is God?” To them the words of the Lord come as a stimulus, “Ye are my witnesses that I am God.” With more determination limn ever they will joyfully respond by putting forth even a greater effort during 1 50.000-Hour Week, so that mother groat witness might be given io the honor of Jehovah’s name. In thus doing, not. only do they carry the message that his name Is exalted, but they will also show the Devil that they arc determined to maintain their integrity and that in spite of his efforts to stop the work tlielr abiding trust and confidence is in Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thore IS a reason for “L50,000-Ilour Week”, and a bigger reason Ilian we at first anticipated. The letter that Brother Rutherford wrote to you on June 12 shows that this week will give God’s people the opportunity, by the Lord’s grace, of turning the seeming defeat suffered in Germany into a victory mid to inform more people concerning God and his Kingdom than they otherwise could. Maybe you thought it was to be “just another drive”. Not so. Tillis is to be a special opportunity l.o turn into victory what seemed like defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Doesn't this show how wonderfully the Lord is dealing with ins people and giving them greater and greater opportunities of witnessing to the honor of his name? The real success of tin's week will be measured in the number of hours which arc given in the actual witnessing work in the Held, going from door to door. If the time is given to the work and each one endeavors to make Iiis witness as effective us possible, tlie books and luHiklets are sure to be left. Here’s something that everyone can do, and that is, put forth an effort to give more time in the work than ever before.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The lines on this issue nre so clearly drawn that each of the Lord’s anointed must take his stand either on one side or on the other. There is no middle ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Therefore the. service director is charged with the responsibility of seeing that each one who partook of Memorial in the class of which he is director is furnished with a copy of this Bulletin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">If additional copies are required we shall be glad to supply them.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Bethel Vacation Not Far Distant</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Tlie Bethel home mid the factory at 117 Adams Street will be closed for a period of two weeks, during which time, as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font4"> Wri/c/i </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tower </span><span class="font4">states, the Bethel family will have their vacation. Tlie dotes are from August 18 to September 1, and during this period no orders can be filled or shipments macle. We hope itiat tlie classes, colporteurs and sharpshooters will check over their stock within the next week or two. If you do not have enough stock on hand to last you until the second week of September, an order should be placed so that we can fill it and ship it before tlie 18th of August. Much mail comes in during the vacation period and this is handled in tlie order in which it is received. IC your order comes in during Unit time it might not be filled for a week-after reopening. Be sure that you are looking after your Kingdom interests and put: in your order for books and booklets early. Pioneers should be sure that they have sufficient territory to keep them busy so they will not have to ask for more until afler October 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A further suggestion is that all tlie cloth-bound books are packed G5 in a carton, with the exception of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp. Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation,</span><span class="font4"> which are packed GO in a carion. If you can order in quantities to make complete cartons, it will save some labor at the depots and at the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you want to be in on the counter attack against the enemy, which we know will be a success, there is a part for you to perform. Now' is tlie time to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">150,000 hours is a lot oC time. It is equivalent to 0,250 2-1-hour days, or 17 years 11 months. Can God’s people in tlie United Slates give such a witness as tliis during this 10-day period? We believe they can by the Lord’s grace, if all get behind the tiling and do their part; but it will mean a lot of joyful service on tlie part of each individual. If you become a hit weary, remember yon are right in the thick of tlie fight, not for yourself, but in the interests of God’s kingdom and for the honor of Jehovah’s</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Each colporteur and class director is to submit a report covering tlie 150,000-Hour Week field activities, using the regular weekly report card for that very purpose. Your 150,000-IIour Week report will be for Friday, July 4, to Sunday, July 13, Inclusive, or a &quot;ten-day-week” report. This will then mean that your report for the week previous thereto will end Thursday, July 3, and will be for only a “four-day-week” report, that is, from Monday (June 30) to Thursday, inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Flense be certain to submit these reports as outlined above, and that promptly. Class directors especially should see to it that their 150,000-Hour Week reports are submitted by the following Sunday, nt the latest. Directors, ns already advised, “don't hold up your class weekly report for a worker or workers who, for a hundred and one reasons or other, fail to report promptly to you,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">REGULAR SHARPSHOOTER</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each regular sharpshooter is being sent n special card on which to report the Held activities covering the 150,000-Hour Week. Tills report should be submitted as soon ns possible after this week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work reported on this special card is not to be included with the report for the month of July. In other words, the sharpshooter monthly report for July will consist only of the work done during the month exclusive of I he 150,000-Hour Week, July 4-13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">How Much Time in July and August?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Every Worker Should Strive to Make 5-Hour Witness</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">It is evident from recent happenings, as outlined in Brother Rutherford's confidential letter and the unfolding of the Lord's prophecies clarifying our vision of his requirements, that the time is here for a real warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In former years we used to have our IBSA Week, special drives and general conventions and feel Justified in relaxing or letting up, for a while at least, afterwards. Those days arc gone forever. The adversary has thrown down the gauntlet, and we who have taken a stand on the Lord’s side and accepted the challenge as God’s anointed witnesses have not taken it up for a day or a week or a month only, but until this warfare is brought to a final conclusion and the Lord’s name glorified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore, after the 150,000-Hour Week our campaign activities would possibly not be as strenuous as during the campaign week itself, because a number of the brethren are taking their vacation or getting time off from their secular employment in order to devote It to the drive during that period, but there should be no let-up in the battle. It should be pressed to the very limit. Each class worker should strive to continue and put at least 5 hours a week in the field service, and us much more as possible. Each pioneer colporteur should devote nor only the 25 or 30 hours required as the minimum, but as much time as he possibly can ; and the auxiliary should likewise recognize that the 12 hours required for those who are enrolled as auxiliaries Is simply the minimum and that it should not be looked upon as a maximum to be attained and then quit. The fight is on now. Every one of God's truly anointed people is involved and the battle must be carried on without abating. Every minute counts. The Lord in judging the faithfulness and loyalty of his people is doing so by the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">effort</span><span class="font4"> put forth, not by the results obtained. The Lord himself is responsible for the results. We are responsible for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">putting forth</span><span class="font4"> our Im.st </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">endeavors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore our activities for July and August should be that of pushing the witness work to the utmost In the rural territory, working thoroughly all the small towns, main highways, and back roads, so that every house will receive a witness between now and late fall. The literature to be used should be, first the $2.40 offer of the 7 books; and where these cannot be placed, drop immediately to the $1.50 combination ; and where this is not taken, then tiie 9 booklets for 50c. The details of preparing these combinations were outlined in a letter recently forwarded to you regarding final preparations for the 150,000-Hour Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time is now here when every one in the ccclesia who claims to be of tile Lord's anointed should be found in the field at least every week, setting aside a definite amount of time for the witness work. If we do not do this, but leave it to chance and go out ‘when opportunity affords’, we shall find a great many weeks going by without participating in the service at all. We should pick out the time we are going to devote, making up at least 5 honrs a week and set that time apart for field service and not permit anything whatsoever to interfere with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It. This Is the business of our King </span><span class="font4">aud should have first consideration. If something must be set aside, then let it be something that is not of so great importance as the kingdom witness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>A Real Labor Day</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">For the Labor Day week-end, comprising the last Saturday and Sunday of August and Monday, September 1, the week-end camping parties suggested in the June </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> under the heading “A Reul Week-End” should be adopted. We usually have beautiful fall weather, it Is not so intensely hot as It is in the middle of the summer. The friends can go to the outlying sections in parties and stay there over the week-end, canvassing during the daytime and getting splendid rest and recreation during the late afternoon and evening. This works not only as a splendid witness, but also provides a healthful change to those who take advantage of it. We believe that this is also a splendid means of “redeeming&quot; or &quot;buying back” the time, that the name of the Lord may be glorified. Each service committee should therefore start planning Immediately, so that all the details can be prepared in advance for these week-ond camps.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Not Transfer Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been a growing inclination on the part of some of the colporteurs to request us to charge to their account at colporteur rates the books which they have taken over from some class. This should not be done without their first having received special instructions to do so, from this office. Books which are sent to the classes are for the use of class workers. If colporteurs desire to have credit on their books they should get their own stock from </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the Society direct </span><span class="font4">In case books are drawn from a class by a colporteur they should be Immediately replaced upon the arrival of the colporteur's own books from the Society. If this is not done it is necessary for us to ask the colporteur to send a money order for the amount of the books taken from the class at the time the list of books is submitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is unwise for colporteurs or any of the friends to run in debt for their stock of books. While the Society has gladly consigned the books to classes and colporteurs, it is with the understanding that the cost price of the books will be set aside as they are placed in the bands of the people, and considered as belonging to the Society, and not for private use. When the account exceeds the stock on hand, the Individual or class is to that extent in debt to the Society. The cost price of books should be remitted regularly to this office every few weeks. Unless this method is followed the individual or class will soon find the account has reached the credit limit, and it becomes necessary for us to ask that remittance accompany each order. This step is necessary in the interests of the Lord’s work in general, and In the interests of the individual as well, since the Lord's advice is to “owe no man anything”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is unwise for a class to lend an unlimited supply of books to its class workers or to colporteurs. Colporteurs should not ask classes to do this, hut should call upon them only in case of an emergency. Then only a few should be borrowed to tide them over until their shipment arrives. For a class to lend a large number of books to a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">col</span><span class="font4">porteur </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font4">has </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">overdrawn his ae-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Continued in preceding column)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Foreign Price Lists</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society has on hand price lists in several foreign languages. If any members of the Englishspeaking classes speak a foreign language and desire a price list, or if some of the Engllsh-Bjjeaking classes desire these foreign price lists, please write the office and we shall be glad to supply them. We will have these in Polish, Greek, German, Italian, Hungarian, Spanish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Russian and Armenian. These are not to be used for general distribution among various individuals, but are for your own use and those who are really interested in the work.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Question and Radio Slips</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the colporteurs have been overlooking the importance of ordering supplies on the regular supply order slips. When you do not use these, but merely mention in a letter that you are low on report curds, etc., you are likely not to get them, as they may be sent to some other address than the one to which you are moving. Please always fill in on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the order label provided</span><span class="font4"> the name and address of the place to which you wish the supplies sent. If you wish them sent “care of general delivery”, always show this on your label or at the top of your order blank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do not use supply order slips for ordering question and radio leaflets, lliese are not considered as supplies, but are charged to the colporteur ordering them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When sending In an order for sup-, plies check up on all your stock to be sure that you have enough of everything, so that you will not need to he sending in another order for something else within a few weeks.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4">count with the Society is extremely unwise. When one gets in debt, to permit him to contract additional debt Is like trying to help a drown</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ing man by tying a stone around his neck.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Nine-Booklet Wrapper </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We Hope It Will Help the Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About a week ago the classes were shipped some wrappers that are to be used to enclose the ulne booklets which the friends are offering to the people for 50c. We have mailed you a consignment of five for each worker in the class, and ten for each auxiliary and pioneer colporteur. If you have not received these please let us know and, while the supply lasts, we will furnish them to you free of charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A good many friends have In the past been offering just one booklet for ten cents or two for fifteen. These booklets contain so many interesting discussions on subjects vital to all the people that an effort should be made to leave all ulne booklets. Probably these wrappers will help the friends and the people at large to recognize that all nine go together. We hope that you will find them helpful in the furtherance of the Kingdom work, the only work In which we are Interested.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Maybe You Can Use It</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">From time to time we receive letters from elderly and feeble sisters stating that they are unable to carry all the seven books and a supply of booklets with them for any length of time and therefore cau take only 2 or 3 books and some booklets. As a result, while they almost always place the books with which they canvass, they are very rarely able to place the entire set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to overcome this, some of the friends have been using the back of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crimes and Calamities or</span><span class="font4"> the back of rhe li ar </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">or Peace </span><span class="font4">booklet to display the set, and then using such books as they have with them for samples, and have had some success with this method. Others have gone a step further and used a pasteboard photograph frame which is overlaid with grained paper, making it to look like morocco leather. These are about 6} x 8j inches over all. The photograph opening is about 4J x6J Inches, with a square of isinglass covering it. These may be obtained in almost any 5 and 10 cent store at 10c each. Some of them are put up singly, while Woolworth’s seem to handle a double frame. However, there is a hinge on the back of the frame which enables you to separate the two parts, so that where one can get only this kind two friends can share and for 20c get a double frame. The back of the IVar </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">or Peace</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crimes and Calamities </span><span class="font4">booklet can be cut off and placed in the photograph frame. They show up splendidly behind the isinglass. One very active colporteur, who is physically unable to carry the sets around with her, is using this method with splendid results. The photograph arrangement seems to work better than simply using the backs of the above booklets for display purposes, because the frame itself is neat and the isinglass finish gives the books a glossy appearance that makes them look very attractive.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Not only has Brother Rutherford written u new book in two volumes, but he Ims also furnished us with a new booklet, culled “PROHIBITION and The League of Nations ; Born of Rod or of the Devil. Which ? The Bibb* Proof”. Tills booklet has a beautifully designed cover, and is going to be used with the books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> during the speeinl “750,000 Testimonies Week”. The nnieh discussed subject of “Prohibition” will, we lielieve, give the friends an excellent opportunity to spread the gospel of the Kingdom among many people who have heretofore had closed ears respecting the message. Much comment has liecn raised ou the subject of “ITohibilion”, and here is a liooklet that “puts” the preachers in llieir place ns they have never before been “put”. There are also some very clever cartoons in this booklet, which help drive the points home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Isn't it wonderful how Ilie l.ord provides so many new things for his people to use (hiring this special witness, Seplember 27 to October 5? All the friends will be armed with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font5"> in two books, and the new booklet. 'Hie field will he virgin territory, and there will be no occasion to say, “We just canvassed this town.” The Lord Is good Io his people, and now he has provided us with all this excellent material, so the battle can be pressed to Hie gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The presses arc working extra time (day mid night) on the new' booklet, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibit ion-,</span><span class="font5"> so that 11. too can be shipped with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> In order to be used in this 750,WO 'Testimonies Week. The Bethel family is glad to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Small classes and colporteurs should place their orders early, so that there will lie ample time for the shipments to reach them. The booklets will be in stock at the depots about September 3. Orders will be tilled at Brooklyn beginning August 11,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now let. us all remember that, as you will see elsewhere in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ihilieiiii;</span><span class="font5"> during the 750,000 Testimonies Week </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibit iim </span><span class="font5">are to be offered for tl.'e.<sup>1</sup>.

<p><span class="font5">\Vc really do not know what to say. nor how to find words to describe litis most wonderful publication, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font5"> Upon Brother Rutherford’s return from California this spring he turned over to the factory manager enough manuscript for two books. The content'’ of), this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">manuscript are so important that, everything in the factory (linotypes, plate department, presses and bookbinding machinery) was lined up for the producing of these two most startling and thrilling books, so that Usey could be in the hands of the friends before the next campaign, which is to be called “750,000 Testimonies Week”, beginning September 27 and ending October 5. Starting May 21, 1930, with the typesetting, we pushed on with the big job, and everyone lias been working hard and faithfully to get </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">f/ight</span><span class="font5"> ready. It Is necessary to put in some extra time in order to accomplish Ibis work by the 10th of August, but the brethren here are very glad to have a part in it because the message these books contain for the church and the world must be gotten out speedily. All will realize this shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font5"> Books Cue and Two, you will find a detailed explanation of Revelation and the second chapter of Daniel, as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Walch Tower </span><span class="font5">has told us. Throughout the books there tire forceful and enlightening illustrations. The books arc distinctively different, bound in royal purple cloth, with most striking embossment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you receive your autographed copy, you will, we feci sure, want to read it through and will be thrilled and marvel at the Lord’s revelation to his people.

<p><span class="font5">hnve a part in rhe most tremendous campaign that lias thus far been waged. Read and understand the “Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him to point out. to his servants the things it is necessary to have done speedily”. “The time is nt band.” Friends, it is wonderful to be in this Kingdom work. Let ! us one and all do this work speedily</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">। and as commanded.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">। cloubtedly it is now the Lord’s due 'time for an understanding of Iteve-lation. You have often wondered about ‘the seven messengers to the churches’, “the seven candlesticks,” ‘the seven vials poured out’; but after reading this book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> they</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">i will be just as clear to you us A B I C. And then about that ‘beast with ! the seven heads and ten horns'; and i then it says that ‘the seventh head throunded the -sixth head'. You have wondered about that, haven't you? The interpretation is just beautiful. After you read this you will understand the ‘Revelation given to Jesus Christ.’, Can you imagine the life history of the remnant written out as plain as day? Just how would you feel If you absolutely knew, and saw things happen before your very eyes, and helped to do them, and then found out later that God foretold all this? W*hnt about “the holy city, new Jerusalem”? We can’t say till we should like to about </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font5"> but it is all simply marvelous. We feel like Simeon, as recorded in Luke 2 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott).</span><span class="font5"> It was revealed to him by the holy spirit that he should not. die until lie should sec the Messiah. When the child Jesus was brought into the temple and Simeon saw the child, he said, ‘Now, O sovereign Lord, dismiss tliy servant in peace according to tliy word; for my eyes hnve seen thy salvation.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Simeon saw the Messiah, and he felt as if he had seen all there was to be seen. After reading </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> we feel us though we had read till there is to be read. There is now one big thing for us to do, and that is io give some one else the privilege of reading it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These books are just wlial. the world has waited for. For nineteen centuries the book of Revelation has completely baffled everyone -who 1ms ever attempted to unlock its mysteries. Now at last, and only because the due time has arrived, it. has yielded up its treasure store of most astonishing truth. The amazing feature of Revelation is Unit nearly all these facts have fruiis-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">And still the circulation of God’s Kingdom message increases. Just glance over the table of figures shoving your activities in the field for the past nine months if you are inclined to believe that the Devil, with the hard times he has brought, upon the people, will be able to frustrate God’s purpose in having the Kingdom proclaimed, To be sure, it may hike more time to place the books ; but the Lord’s anointed are pressing forward with the witness work as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■While we greatly rejoiced in the , wonder tut results of lust year, the figures for the first nine months show that 127.233 more clothbouud books have been placed in Hie United Stales so far than were placed during the same period of lime last year. There has been an increase of 9.80,318 booklets. While tills figure includes the 5&lt; booklets, which were not taken into consideration in last years quota figures, there has been an actual increase of 588,S52 hi just the 10(f booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We really think that this is remarkable when Hie unforeseen financial depression is taken into consideration. Tins has naturally had its effect, particularly in the placing of large book combinations, altering the percentage of book's and booklets so that probably we shall not he able to reach the book nuota of 2,750,000. But there is still a good possibility of rcimbiug the combined quota of 5.500,000, The total now stands al. 3,030,692, which leaves 1,800,308 to be placed during the months of July. August and September. That’s a large number am] will mean n lot of time to be spent in the field singing forth the Lord's praises. To make it will moan the placing of an average of 113,800 pieces of literature each of the 13 weeks. That’s a big task; but with the results of 15O.01KI-11 our Week to help out iu July, I here is tt chance to make it. In other words, we hope to place 023,100 books and booklets for each of these three months. We crossed the 600,000 one month this year. Cun we do it three more?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us continue to press the battle to the gates, and, by doing our part and leaving the results with the Lord, we arc con lit I ent that whatever the results may be they will be to rhe encouragement of his people, and to the honor of his name.

<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Other Countries’ Response to Drives Encouraging</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">The very evident prearrangemenl of these drives by the Lord himself Is almost startling when first discerned, and from then on they be come a source of peace, joy and tin disturbed confidence tn the Ixutl to those who are the Lord's anointed. Before we take up the details of this coining campaign we wish to call your attention to a few of the marked evidences of the Lord's pre-arrangement for this and the former drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As outlined in the letter sent out by Brother Rutherford and the las: two </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">liulletin*.</span><span class="font5"> no one on earth knew about the Devil’s attack on the So ciety’s funds in Germany before 1 took place, but the Lord knew i' and arranged accordingly. Th!.-would have been discouraging to at least some of the anointed if tin Lord had not revealed to us througl T?ie Il’nieft </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font5"> the ministry of his holy angels to actually care for protect and preserve the best inter ests of the Kingdom. Each one o the anointed tiow knows that thi Lord knew about it ami that ti could not happen unless the Lon' allowed it for some good purpose That purpose was to place the issm squarely before the anointed. Before this event was revealed the Lord had prearranged for a drive week, known as the 150,000-Hour Week, to eotne off just sit the righl time, not only in the United States, but in England, continental Europe. Canada, and other parts from which we have not yet heard. In Germany it was 90,000 hours, in England 75,000 hours, in Canada 10,000 hours, In Holland. 500 hours. There has been nothing since the days of the World War and the arrest of the officers of the Lord's visible organization that has hit the church with such force and united its :ic tivlty as this has. The testimony from colporteurs and class workers (given in another part of Ulis </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin')</span><span class="font5"> Is a most inspiring testimony of God’s eave, guidance and protection. Surely He who sits in the heavens will hold the Devil and his crowd in derisiou.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, it was no flowery path of roses to follow, by any means. The Devil fought every inch of the way. It is true he cannot harm the anointed who are in the secret place of the Most High, but he can and does act upon and influence those whom you are canvassing. That is what makes this a real fight and one in which only real soldiers, who are wholly obedient to their great Leader, our Lord Jesus Christ, and under the protection of the Almighty, can hope to come off victorious. This was not a bookselling proposition. It was putting forth the effort by devoting the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">time</span><span class="font5"> to the Lord’s service, knowing that the Lord would give it the increase. And even if you do not obtain the results, remember that the Lord Is not resting you upon the basis of the results you get, but upon your maintaining your integrity before him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">this campaign a success. The majority of the directors and service committees give this matter careful consideration and get splendid results. There are others, we are sorry to say, whose reports and results manifest a woeful lack of real interest and cooperation. To those brethren we make a special plea at this time. In view of the issue precipitated by Satan’s attack upon the Lord’s organization, it devolves upon all the anointed to take their stand wholly on the Lord’s side. Tlie director and service committee are charged with the responsibility of taking the lead In planning ami carrying into action the plan of campaign in your ecclesia. They arc charged with this responsibility before the Lord, and anyone who cannot or will not take the lead in this matter should resign and permit someone who will to take Ills place. Tlie time for sentimental tolerance of indifferent brethren or brethren who are opposed to the advance march of tlie Lord’s army Is past. The fight is on, and those who are on the Lord’s side must not only be called and ehosen, but also be faithful under the test. Let it be 100% cooperation by each class and each worker in the classes. This campaign is going to be worldwide in its scope. We are sure that each branch of the Society throughout the world is making its preparations for this drive. Therefore,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* &quot;Forward!” be our watchword; Steps and voices joined, Seek the things before us, Not a look behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'Forward in the service, Through the toil and fight;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus goes before us, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;»</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ziou beams with light.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By now you will wonder where we got the idea of “750,000 Testimonies Week&quot;, and we are going to tell you; but first we want to explain what constitutes a “testimony”. If you go to a house and no one answers at the door, manifestly that is not a testimony. Or if a child answers end says there is no one else at home, that is not a testimony. A testimony is a call at a home where some adult member of the family listens to a portion of your canvass and has had an opportunity to know tlie nature of your call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the period from September 27 to October 5 we are expecting that 750,0(H) such testimonies will be given. We are using the same basis for our estimate that we used in the 150,000-Hour Week; namely, 1,100 pioneer colporteurs ! putting in 44 hours each, making | 48,4011 hours; 75b auxiliaries at 22 hours each, making 16,500 hours; and 8,500 class workers putting In 10 hours each, equaling &amp;5,000; or (in a round number) a grand tolal of 150,000 hours. All reports to date indicate that the majority of the workers are putting in well over the very conservative number of hours called for in this estimate. Each worker should be able to give five testimonies an liour in urban territory where the houses are close together. This allows about ten minutes for each testimony, after allowing for houses where there is no one at home. If in ten minutes a prospect cannot be sufficiently interested in what you have, to lake it, further canvassing that, one is a waste of time in the majority of cases. Therefore, five canvasses an hour for 159,000 hours will mean 750,000 testimonies. That will mean an average of 220 testimonies for each pioneer, 110 testimonies for each auxiliary, and 50 testimonies for each class worker. If cacti one does his part we cannot fail to make 750,000 testimonies. THIS MEANS THAT EVERY CLASS WORKER AND COLPORTEUR MUSI' KEEP TRACK OF AND REPORT THE TESTIMONIES MADE. PLEASE DO NOT OVERLOOK THIS ; IT IS IMPORTANT.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5">Likewise In the 750,000 Testimonies Week campaign, it is not a matter of bookselling. It is doing whrit the Lord commissioned his people to do; namely, to beiir testimony to the people that he is God, that his Son is the reigning King and that his Kingdom is the only hope for suffering humanity. Of course this message in its most permanent form is in the literature, something they can keep in the home and continually refer to and thoroughly investigate, and an effort should be made to leave it wherever possible. The Lord's witness, however, cannot be responsible for the results, but he Is responsible for putting forth the effort and calling upon the people.. Whether they hear or whether they forbear is something that we must leave to the Lord, for he himself io tells us, saying, ‘My word which proceedcth out of my mouth shall accomplish that which I please, and shall prosper in Hie thing whereun-to I have sent it.’ Our responsibility, therefore, is to see that wc are obedient, witnesses and giving testimony to his purposes as now revealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord's evident advance preparations for the 150,000-IIour Week are also very marked in the preparation for the 750,000 Testimonies Week. When Hie original plans were made for this drive we did not know that the Devil's crowd werqj going to prepare the field for us by putting on extensive nation-wide prohibition campaigns, periodic shootings of innocent people, and sinking of boats, in order to enforce this Issue, so that today it is the most talked-of issue In the country. A copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibition</span><span class="font5"> should be ieft in every home. Regarding </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font5">Book One and Book Two, you’ll have to read them In order to see how marvelously the Lord has prearranged for these books to be released at this time. Surely “God standelh in the congregation of the mighty” and is accomplishing the good pleasure of his will. We are thoroughly convinced that each one who has been taken into the covenant for tile Kingdom and is abiding under the Lord's anointing will, after reading these hooks, be straining at the leash waiting for September 27, when these three will be released for public distribution. Yon will realize more than ever before bow Jeremiah felt, with ‘the word of the Lord as a consuming lire within his bones’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">DETAILS OF THE WEEK</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This fall campaign brings us back to working our urban territory again.

<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Conventions Do Splendidly in 3 Days</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">Wlint a glorious wook it was! To be sure, the Devil was on the job mid put forth a strenuous effort to discourage the people from taking the literature, but we feel confident that there was never a greater witness given l.o the people of this country than during 150,000-IIour Week. At the lime this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font5"> is published it is too early yet to give you the final results, but from the few gleanings which we have received the results are most encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What rejoices our hearts is to behold the determined spirit which those who love the Lord have manifested in this great attack, liven though much opposition was encountered, even though in certain sections of the country till heat records were broken, even though the people are undergoing great, oppression and the hard times make a scarcity of money everywhere, the witnesses for the Lord were undaunted. Many have written us that they never had a harder time in placing the books, indicating the strenuous efforts which the Devil is putting forth to keep the people in ignorance of God’s kingdom ; nevertheless the witness was given. In spite of everything lite Devil may do, this Kingdom gospel must be preached. The gauntlet had been thrown down by Satan; It was picked up by the remnant and, judging from some of I he early reports, the greatest shout of praise in the history of the Elisha work was raised by this little band to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the friends assembled together in conventions for the first three days of the attack, at which those who attended and participated in the work averaged seven hours each in the door-to-door witnessing work. How different that is from the old-time convention, when the only one to speak forth the Lord’s praises was Ilie one on the platform I <sup>7</sup>l’lie six conventions on which we have reports totaled 7,373 hours in the work. Another basis for comparison is the classes visited by the Bethel brethren during July 4-6 ami the same classes during Hay IBSA Week. During the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">entire</span><span class="font5"> week of nine days in May these classes put in 2,1)00 hours in the field, whereas for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">first three (lays only</span><span class="font5"> of 150,000-Hour Week the same classes put in 3,092 hours. With only three days gone, and seven more to sing forth the praises of Jehovah, surely a much greater witness must have been left. Krom one small class a report has been received which shows that during May IBSA Week they had 7 workers in the field for a total of 32 hours. When they saw the Issue squarely before them they responded as never before. While the usual attendance at prayer meetings numbers only 14, even some of the others were encouraged to participate and the final report for the week shows a total of 17 workers putting in 261 hours. Now that’s splendid, and we venture to say that the friends in that class are happier than ever. As a result, more literature was placed in the hands of the people during this ten-day period </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">than the class usually places in two </span><span class="font5">months’ time. That shows what can be done when the effort is put forth. From one large class on the west, coast came these encouraging words, “Drive week going fine. Workers' average first three days, ten hours each.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This mighty effort to sing forth the Lord’s praises lias been joined in by the pioneer colporteurs as well as the auxiliaries, and as we glance over some of the reports our hearts fill with joy and love for these faithful workers. Of course tire terrific heat in some places made It impossible for some of the friends to do as they would; sickness and other obstacles arose in the path of others; but in spite of these it does seem as if everyone made a determined effort to do what lie could. When we picked up one card from a sister 60 years old and saw that site reported 102 hours, we were filled with amazement. Several other pioneer colporteurs have reported as many as 96 hours in the field during this ten-day period, mid a good number worked 70, 75, 80 and 85 hours. Some most encouraging reports have been received from the auxiliary colporteurs loo, showing that, they were anxious to demonstrate their devotion to the Lord by putting forth an additional effort to show forth his praises. You would be surprised to see the. number of reports that we are receiving indicating that 25, 30, 35 and us high as 57 hours have been given to singing forth the Lord’s praises by going from door to door. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot; Satan may have sought to discourage the Lord’s anointed, but from these early indications we believe that the counter attack has resulted in a victory to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Some Flashes of Joy</span></h3>
<h5><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Happy Because of 150,000-Hour Week</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">Would you like to hear what some of those who have written to us have had to say about this glorious week? If so, glance over the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One colporteur writes, “This has been a great week. Although the intense heat has been hard, yet we thank our Father for the privilege of showing our love and devotion in the little things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another says, “I just want to say that this has been a joyous time in singing forth the praises of our God and our Lord, and I caunot titanic him enough for the little part he has given me in this blessed work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another writes, &quot;Just a few lines at the end of Victory<sup>7</sup> Drive. By the strength from the Lord 1 gained a victory over the Devil. Ue seemed to put everything in the way to hinder us from the work; but thank the Lord for giving me strength to go over the top in victory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This colporteur says, &quot;The past ten days have been days of exceptional joy<sup>7</sup>. The privilege has been wonderful indeed, to be numltered with others of the anointed servant class in ‘bringing forth the fruits of the Kingdom’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This letter also manifests the determined spirit of the Lord’s wit</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">nesses: &quot;Oh how thankful I am for </span><span class="font5">this 10 days' work, thankful the Lord gave me strength! 103 in the shade on Saturday, when I walked eighteen blocks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I surely<sup>7</sup> enjoyed this drive,” says this sister, &quot;and I uni so glad that the Lord gave me the privilege of going from door to door to tell the most wonderful message that was ever told to anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brother and sister write, &quot;The Ill-day service week has just ended. It has been the most encouraging, and the most joy-inspiring week we have ever had. ... It seems that we are finding more interest this year than ever before, and it. has been a real joy to lake the Kingdom message to a few hungry people.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This brother says, “I put in all the hours I could, and diligently proclaimed the message of the coming Kingdom with all my strength and physical powers. It was a great lime of rejoicing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Here is my little portion of the 150,000-IIour Week. Went every day</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Continued on page 4, column 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">likewise many more will hear the good news even though they do not take any literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This table shows also how busy the workers were who attended the various three-day conventions, July<sup>7 </sup>4-7, and again demonstrates how the Lord has poured out ins spirit on all flesh so that, now ail ‘the sons ami daughters’ can participate in proclaiming the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While working hard to complete </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Liyht</span><span class="font5"> before vacation, the Bethel family was glad'to have the privilege of getting out into the field work with the rest of the Lord’s people. We had a really good time in lifting our voices to the praise of Jehovah in this way, besides preparing the literature. We came back to our regular work much refreshed ns a result of the 12.7 hours which was the average time spent in the work. A total of 2,389 hours were put in towards the 150,000 goal, and 8,747 pieces of literature were left in the bunds of the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We have been so interested in kiO.OOO-Hour Week that wo couldn’t wait until all the reports cams in. We have selected one class report for the week from each of 44 different states, an auxiliary<sup>7</sup> ciilporleut’s report from each of 45 different states, and a pioneer’s report from each of 48 different states, in nn effort to get some idea as to what some have done for the week. Of course it is impossible to use these results as a basis for estimating Lise final results; but to us it is veryencouraging to see the more strenuous effort which many of the friends have put forth, in comparison with the nine-day IBSA &quot;Week in May. With the added day, the 11 classes increased almost two hours' time per worker; and 135 additional workers participated. This makes 2,408 hours over IBSA Week towards the 150,000 goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just look at what ihe 48 pioneers averaged ! 61.7 hours in the field for the ten days, as compared with 36.8 for IBSA Week. Of course, not every one pmt in this much time; but some worked many more hours, thus bringing up the average. These cards were not selected because they were the best reports, but, ralher, because they were from colporteurs who were among those that put in more time than during IBSA Week. The same is true concerning the cards from auxiliaries, which have been selected from 45 different states. These put in almost twice as much lime as during Ihe May week, averaging 29.9 instead of 15.8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is also interesting lo note the increase in Ihe amount of literature that has been placed as a result of this increased activity. This goes to show that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">time,</span><span class="font5"> that is devoted to witnessing for Ilie Kingdom is essential.

However, us we consider the conditions throughout the country, and particularly the hard limes in many sections, It seems advisable now to change the second offer from the $1.50 combination to a $1.00 combination composed of two bound books and booklets sufficient to make It $1.00, These combinations might he made up of /Top/t-cey and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font5"> and two booklets, or the two torty-five-eent books and one booklet, or any oilier combination that tho worker may desire to push.

<p><span class="font5">If the dollar combination cannot, be placed, then drop to the nine booklets for 50(4. Every class should put forth Its best efforts to see that its rural territory is covered before the 750.000 Testimonies Week campaign opens.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>The Great Mystery? ? ?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">In the Class Weekly Report Card Instructions the following statement is made: “It is very important that every card he properly headed. Oftentimes a failure to do this makes it impossible to know by which class the report card was submitted, and this Is as bnd us not submitting a report at all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A failure by directors to heed the above instructions has from time to time placed us in &quot;perilous predicaments” which require the genius of a Sherlock Holmes. For illustration, here is one ease now pending:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A certain director failed to head his report card; no date was given, nor name of the class, etc.; the “heading” was blank, but the rest of the card was filled out completely. As the card was not mailed from any local post office, but was evidently mailed on a train en route, no city or town was postmarked on the card ns is the case when sent through the local post office. The only clue (and it is insufficient to help us) is that it was mailed on the train en route between “Selma and Pensacola”. As there arc two or three hundred classes between the many Selmas and not quite so many I’ensacolas. to solve tills mystery we need the help of the one who mailed the card.

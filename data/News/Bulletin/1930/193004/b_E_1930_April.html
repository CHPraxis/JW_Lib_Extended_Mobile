<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>It Will Be a Humdinger of a Week</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Tills Kingdom gospel must be preached! In order that another great proclamation might be heralded throughout the earth, the Lord’s anointed in every land are making preparations for the 9 days from April 26 to May 4. Enthusiasm Is running high; and the way tilings are beginning to look, tins coming IBSA Week Is going to be a “humdinger”. Just think of it, the friends In far-off South Africa, Australia, Japan, as well as England, Germany, and all the other countries and the isles of the sea where there are any of the Lord’s anointed, are centering their hearts and their prayers on this great week. It is because of this unity In action that even the worldly organizations are taking notice. A colporteur met a certain salesman recently who told him that at one of their recent sales conferences they had studied the methods of the Bible Students -in the hope of Instilling the same spirit Into their organization. Of course they cannot do this; for this spirit Is not one of self-interest, but of unselfish devotion to the Lord. Nevertheless it was brought out In their conference how remarkable It was that the Bible Students not only throughout the United States but throughout the entire earth worked In such perfect accord. It was pointed out how all responded as one man whenever special instructions were issued. Apparently some of them have listened to Brother Rutherford’s announcements of these special weeks at the conclusion of his big radio hook-ups; they have heard him say that some one would call upon them with a certain book or message and then have seen the little army of the Lord hard at work in the field doing just as he has pointed out from the Bible that they would be doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is an old saying that “in union there is strength”. Thus the effectiveness of past IBSA Weeks has been due to the fact that the Lord’s people throughout the entire earth have pressed forward with the Kingdom message, seeing eye to eye have carefully followed Instructions, and consequently have enjoyed the Lord’s special blessings upon their efforts to show forth his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to make this week one of tlje-'blggest ever, we should all make it a subject of prayer and begin to arrange our other affairs now, so that when the time comes we can </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">in the field work as many hours as possible. Time In the field is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">e&amp;je</span><span class="font5">ntial in making these IBSA </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">\reks what they are. If we want </span><span class="font5">to see more books placed during the one coming than In any previous week, then the way to do this is to plan to give more time to witnessing. It will mean a lot of good hard work to surpass the former figures and to place a grand total of 300,000 pieces of literature. That Is a big total; but If each one puts forth the effort, with the Lord’s blessing it can be done. Do you remember how much time you gave to the work during last IBSA Week and the one In the spring? Then glance over the following totals and see how much additional work It is going to mean for you to do your part towards reaching the 300,000. Here are the results of previous IBSA Weeks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Held Friday Night, April 25</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Brother Rutherford Speaks on 2 Chains </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Arrangements Made for April 27</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>A Real Introduction for IBSA Week</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Everyone of the truly anointed in the United States and Canada, and those in other countries who can possibly do so, will be listening in to Brother Rutherford Sunday morning, April 27. On Saturday, the 26th, the first day of IBSA Week, every worker will make a strenuous effort to get into the field and place some of the books and booklets concerning the Kingdom, and will at the same time leave at each home canvassed a slip advertising this special lecture, “World Distress. Cause. Remedy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Sunday morning, while the broadcast Is on In your vicinity, every worker will be cheered to hear a most timely message. The broadcast will consist of two separate chains, one for the East and one for the West. From 9 to 10 a. m., Eastern Standard </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Time,</span><span class="font5">, approximately ^O-stations will be hooked together. Brother Rutherford will speak in Oakland, California, at 6.00 a.m., Pacific Standard Time, used there. Again, from 10 to 11 a.m., Pacific Standard Time, Brother Rutherford will give this same lecture over an entirely different chain of more than eleven stations. This lecture, given twice, covering all the territory in the United States, Is going to prepare the minds of the people for the biggest witness ever given. Right after the broadcast thousands of workers will tell some of the burning ears a little more and leave with them a most wonderful set of books; and, think of it 1 only $2.40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has prepared a special handbill advertising both chains and Is able to supply these at $1.00 a thousand, to the classes or to any Individual who may wish to order them. A few days in advance of the broadcast, place these with the people you expect to canvass during IBSA Week, for we believe this will help remind many to listen in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We wonder if you feel the same as we do at headquarters: “Get lots of practice between now and then. Be in the field as long as possible on Saturday, April 27. On Sunday morning stand by for one hour, while the heavy artillery lets loose, and afterwards, by the Lord's grace, we will give them something they never expected.” Are you with us? Are you ready?</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Presses Working on 3,000,000 Run</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">With These, Quota Will Easily Be Reached </span><span class="font5">Kight now at 117 Adams Street the presses are rolling and roaring and eating up paper like hungry animals. But it is beautiful to see them work. Ou the floor below there are stitchers, stackers, cutters, folders and packers, eagerly getting out two of the most beautiful booklets ever published. But even more than being beautiful, they are two of the dandiest treatises on God’s purposes we have ever seen. Brother Rutherford calls one of them War or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peace, Which?</span><span class="font5"> This Is a short story of a lawyer, a big financier, and a certain Right Reverend Doctor Sanballat. What a name! and what a story! You will like it, and you will want to help us place millions of them. Then there is the other, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Crimes and Calamities. The Cause. The Remedy.</span><span class="font5"> And this too is a lovely, intensely interesting booklet for the people to think about. We have been doing our best here to make these books look prettier than anything we have ever had before, and we know that when you see them and read them you will say that they are the best yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shipments of these two new booklets are now being made to tlie classes. To the smaller classes, we are combining the consignment of booklets with their consignment of Flashtones. To other classes, who have already received their Flashtone cartons, the booklets will be shipped In a few weeks. However, we hope some classes to which we do not ship books or booklets on consignment will place their orders early, and include some other books to make up a hundred-pound shipment, if possible. As for the auxiliary’ and pioneer colporteurs, no consignments will be made to them; but as they can’t get along without these, they will please place orders with the next shipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Booklets will be in stock at the Oakland depot about May 1. But at Brooklyn and St. Louis we shall be able to fill orders about April 7. These two new booklets will be a great help to all the friends In placing combinations of 4 for 25c, 6 for 40c, and 9 for 50c. A good many of the classes have some of the very oldest booklets, such as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">World Distress. Desirable Government, Standard for the People,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the People.</span><span class="font5"> We suggest that in your booklet combinations you work these off as soon as possible, because they are getting quite old now; and with these splendid prices on booklets, we feel sure that they will easily be disposed of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are wondering if it would not be a good average for every worker to place at least four booklets in every booklet placement. Some have been in the habit of leaving just one or two booklets. Why not make our average four? This can easily be accomplished if sometimes we place 6 for 40c or 9 for 50c. With War </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">or Peace</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Crimes and Calamities,</span><span class="font5"> we feel sure that the quota set for the year will be more than reached. Read the two booklets as soon as you get them, and then give some one else a chance to do the same.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">February a Record-Breaker</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Colporteurs Did More than Last August What Would 800 Auxiliaries and 1,200 Pioneers Do?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">The month of February proved to be the best winter month on record, as far as colporteur activities are concerned. Say, pioneers, do you realize that you placed more books during this one month, in the middle of winter, in spite of all the unemployment and hard luck stories which you are hearing on every hand, than you did last August, right in the middle of the summer season? Well, it is a fact; for you disposed of 105,510 cloth-bound books, as compared with 105,441 books last August. Even July was not much better, with 107,696 books. There were more colporteurs in the field at that time, too: an average of 962 reporting weekly, as compared with only 891 for February. Now, how did you do it? By working and enjoying the Lord’s blessings. During the midwinter month the 891 colporteurs, totaling as many hours in tlie work as the 962 gave during August, reporting weekly, averaged 25.21 for the four weeks in the service. That’s fine! It shows what can be done if the effort is put forth. The average number of books placed per hour has taken a decided jump over the January rate, comparing favorably with the rate for last August, Just think of it, compar-</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Reports for IBSA Week</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Classes and colporteurs, both auxiliary and pioneer, are asked to send in tlieir weekly report for IBSA Week as promptly as possible. The report is to be made out on the usual weekly report card, but is to be for the entire 9-day period from April 26 to May 4, inclusive. This will mean that the report for the week previous will end with Friday, April 25, instead of Sunday, April 27, and will be for only 5 days Instead of the regular 7-day period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sharpshooters, who usually send in a report only once a month, are requested to make an exception and send in a card for IBSA Week also, since they, too, will be putting forth a special effort during this special period. Tills will mean, of course, that work done during this week will not be included in their regular monthly reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If everyone remembers to send in the report promptly, it will enable us to make an early tabulation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Order Your Flashtones</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Again we wish to remind the colporteurs, both pioneer and auxiliary, to send in their orders for Flashtone cartons for IBSA Week. These are shipped on order only, and when packed with the sets of 7 (“jr”). Cartons are not shipped without the books. It is to be remembered also that the cartons, being a special feature of IBSA Week, should not be offered to the people prior to the beginning of IBSA Week. If you have any left over at the conclusion of the week, then you can continue to offer them, of course. Since 8 sets fill a shipping carton, by ordering them in multiples of 8, much time in filling orders can be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Orders should be figured on the 100-pound basis, as previously instructed, and sufficient should be on hand to last throughout the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ing one of the worst months of the year, for weather and financial conditions among the people, with one of the best. This proves that the new prices are appreciated by the people in this time of depression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tlie auxiliary colporteurs have also done excellent work, placing 19,199 books and 18,319 five-cent and ten-cent booklets. The average number to report weekly was 510 for the month, which is a decided increase over January, for which time there were only 383. The time spent in the work by these averaged 11.16 hours weekly. This is the best month for the auxiliaries since last September, when 22,284 books were placed. As a matter of fact, it is really better than last September, due to the fact that that was a 5-week month, whereas February was only a 4-week. The weekly average for February was 4,800; for September 1929, the best month during last year, 4,457; and for September 1928, the peak month for auxiliaries for all times, only 4,735.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Keep up the good work, auxiliaries. With tlie new ones being added to the list each day, you’ll be doing some big things before the year is over. Wie are looking forward to the time when 800 auxiliaries and 1,200 pioneers will be reporting every* week, and that very soon.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Something for May a Little Different</span></h1>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Let’s Try Speaking a Foreign Tongue</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">During the month of May the German, Greek and Polish classes are putting on an int^rfational drive with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> in tlieir languages for $l.Qfr a set. These sets are shipped to We classes at 90c each, or 15c a volume, except in the German language, in which we have only the first five volumes. This set of five is to be offered to the public for $1.00, and to the class at 90c a set or 20c a volume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In all English territory assignments there are some of all these nationalities which should be witnessed to during the month. To enable the English friends to do tills, tlie sets as outlined above will be shipped to tlie classes at the rate shown. To further unify tlie campaign, the English volumes are offered to the foreign brethren at 90c a set and 15c a volume, to be placed with the public at $1.00 a set. This offer will also be extended to English-speaking classes participating in this campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the IBSA Week drive, therefore, the service committees will carefully inspect their territory and arrange for the necessary workers or drives to cover these nationalities during the month. The preparations will, of course, vary according to the number of people to be witnessed to in each territory, but the general objective should be the same: that of giving a thorough witness with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> to these foreign-speaking people. The manifest blessing of the Lord on the campaign with the English </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies</span><span class="font5"> is an Indication that the Lord would be pleased to have a thorough witness given in all languages in which the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies</span><span class="font5"> are available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tills has also the effect of unifying the Lord’s army regardless of language. The way the foreignspeaking brethren took hold of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font5"> campaign indicated their complete and whole-hearted cooperation witli the English-speaking friends in their campaign, and we are convinced that the English-speaking friends are not going to be one whit behind them in this respect when the situation is reversed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These books will not be shipped on consignment. Therefore, order sufficient of each kind to adequately cover your territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">GO THROUGH THE GATES; LIFT UP A STANDARD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">FOR THE PEOPLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each anointed one gets a special joy during IBSA Week because of participating in the united effort of God’s anointed throughout the world to magnify the name of Jehovah. Every' worker should be In the field if It is physically possible for him to do so. This united drive provides a marvelous opportunity to magnify the name of the Lord and to manifest to the Devil and his organization the united relationship that exists in God’s organization, each one standing shoulder to shoulder fighting against the common enemy. This united drive affords the Lord’s people, by his grace, an opportunity to give tlie Devil and his cohorts, especially the wickedly pious and more-holy-than-thou preachers, a test of the plagues written in the book. This mighty song of praise to Jehovah Is going to sound loudly during IBSA Week, and no one can afford to miss the fun. Songs of praise to Jehovah, and dirges of despair to the enemy. Come on in; let the dew from Mount Hermon engulf you! This water is fine!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The foregoing should, in a general way, permeate the last service meeting prior to IBSA Week in order that a clear vision of tlie privilege afforded to the anointed might be before each one as lie goes forth to battle. This meeting, wherever possible, should be held Friday night, April 25, so that tlie issue will lie very clear In everyone’s mind.</span></p>

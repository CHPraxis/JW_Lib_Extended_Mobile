<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ab we come to consider the past year’s activity of the English and foreign-speaking classes and sharpshooters it is with thanksgiving to the Lord for the marvelous way in which he used his people to magnify his name throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fiscal year just closing was one of continual depression, from a business standpoint. Abnormal weather .conditions,' resulting in crop failures in large areas of this cuuuiiy, and the oppression of the people by tlio prominent ones in Satan’s organization were such as to make the giving of an effective witness to the Lord’s glory impossible if we viewed it from a worldly standpoint. Yet despite all of these, which indicate the best efforts on the part of Satan to stop the work, the Lord used his people to give the most tremendous and widespread witness ever given on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As we make an analysis of the activities of the different parts of the Lord’s organization we note that no one branch stands out prominently, but that each one, whether in large classes or of isolated sharpshooters or those who speak a foreign tongue, got practically the same results for the time one spent in the service. This is positive proof that this work that we are doing is not of human origin (Continued on page 4, column 2)</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Blessings Untold Are Those of the Anointed</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fiscal year of 1930 came to a close October I. The report for the year’s activities is most encouraging, as it reveals that those really in the truth in the United States have been making the kingdom, interests the biggest thing iu life and have been putting forth a determined effort to show forth the praises of Jehovah. That which is most gratifying to ns is the way the friends have responded to tiie doing of the work which the Lord has commissioned them to do as liis witnesses. As strenuous as the campaign was for the year 1929, during 1930 more workers were regularly in Ilie field and gave more hours to the work. Instead of the 1,480 pioneer and auxiliary colporteurs and 3,900 class workers which were </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font2">the field weekly during 1929, the past year saw 1,751 colporteurs and 4,375 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">class work</span><span class="font2">ers. And how these friends did </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">work! </span><span class="font2">Almost half a million more hours, 445,893 to be exact, were given in singing forth the praises of Jehovah, or n total of 2,379,597 hours, as compared with 1,933,704 hours in 1929. That in itself is evidence of how the real kingdom interests are being taken away from those who have hid their one talent in the earth and given to the ten-talent class, for those who have a real vision of God’s purpose arc diligently seeking to increase their kingdom privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And now, what about the total books and booklets placed? While the quota was not reached, on account of the unforeseen financial distress, which kept many from obtaining the literature, more clothbound books and 10(4 booklets were placed during the past year than in any other year in the, history of the church. The final totals showed</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">His Servant Gave a Real Witness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">2,057,282 books, as compared with 1,915,003 during 1929; or an increase of 142,279. The 10(4 booklets placed numbered 2,620,124, as compared with 1,877,891 during 1929; or an increase of 742,233. Of course there was a big decrease in the number of 5(4 booklets placed, on account of there being no special effort made with these, and therefore the total literature placed during the year was less than that during 1929. Only 504,924 5(5 booklets were placed, as compared with the 2,050,998 during 1929. This was expected, but it seems to us really remarkable that with 1,546,074 more 5(5 booklets placed in 1929 than in 1930 this large lead should bo so far overcome that the total literature distributed numbers 5,182,330, or only 661,562 less than during 1929. Since 5(* booklets were excluded in figuring the quota for 1929, but were included in that for 1930, the results on the quota basis show a total increase for 1930 of 142,279 books and 1,247,157 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This tremendous witness was left in 2,292,443 homes; which means that practically 10,000,000 people will be in direct contact with the literature which has been left in their homes during the past year. One might say “ten million” without really appreciating what a city this makes, but when it is considered that this represents almost one-twelfth of the people in the entire United States, or more than the entire population in the states of Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas combined, one can better appreciate just what it means. Many more have received the witness over the radio. Surely there is great cause for rejoicing on the part of those who love the Lord to see how wonderfully he is having the witness given that he is Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">In the year 1921-1922 the auxiliary colporteur work was organized, during which period there was an average of 194 auxiliary' colporteurs enrolled throughout the year. The uext year saw the enrollment list increased to an average of 312. But it was not until 1928-1929 that the real privilege of being a colporteur was recognized by<sup>r</sup> the friends in general. During that year the enrollment list took a decided jump to 635. We thought that that was splendid, but during the year which has just drawn to a close there has been another snbstantial gain, the average enrollment being 750, with a peak enrollment of 933 reached on July 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The faithfulness with which tho auxiliary' colporteurs are endeavoring to carry out their divine commission may' be judged by the fact that out of this number there has been an average of 545 who have reported regularly each week, as compared with 408 during the previous year. These put in an average of 10.4 hours weekly, as compared with the 8.45 during 1929, or practically 2 hours more weekly. This may be accounted for by the fact that Sunday's’ time has been included during 1930, whereas previously the method of reckoning excluded Sundays. By putting forth this effort the auxiliary colporteurs were able to give a total of 294,283 hours in the witness work, as compared with 179,496 during 1929, Isn’t that splendid? We especially (Continued on page 4, column 4)</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>They Have Reason to Rejoice</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The pioneer colporteurs’ report for 1930 is chock-full of encouragement for those who have been giving their full time and strength in the most glorious work there is because their chief desire is to make known the kingdom message. This little band increased its numbers from an average of 834 working weekly during 1929 to 938 working weekly' during 1930. *The peak was reached on September </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">17, when there were 1,320 who had </span><span class="font2">their names on the pioneer list. The time these 938 put in the work each week averaged 23.44 hours, instead of only 20.98 during 1929, showing that the pioneers are more and more a j’preciuling the necessity of being or. the job regularly in order to be able to keep in the full-time service of Jehovah. As to be expected, therefore, there was a marked increase in the number of hours devoted to the witness work, totaling 1,143,-160 hours, instead of 919,356 hours of the previous year. This time was given to carrying the kingdom gospel into many sections of the country' where some may be hungering and thirsting for the message. The thickly populated areas us well as homes in the most remote rural sections were served with the fruit of the kingdom by this little band of faithful servants of the Lord who have thought more about singing forth his praises than they have about the comforts and luxuries of life. They have willingly and joyfully' pressed onward in spite of almost everything imaginable to discourage and dishearten them from maintaining their integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tho Lord has richly blessed their efforts to leave the kingdom message in printed form in the hands of the people, also; for in spite of all the trouble which Satan has heaped upon the people in his efforts to turn them against God, they placed 1,194,356 bound books, and 1,130,372 10(4 and 148,962 5(4 booklets. Even, with the special effort winch was given with the 5(4 booklet during 1929, the pioneers actually placed more pieces of literature during the year just past than in the one previous. The grand total numbered 2,473,690, as compared with 2,433,616 in 1929. Surely this is a cause for rejoicing, because (Continued ou page 3, column 4)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Is Being Preached 391,433 Testimonies Given by 9,015 Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have the report from the classes and sharpshooters for the 750,000 Testimonies Week, and it, like the yearly report, indicates the Lord’s blessing on his people. As far as the amount of literature is concerned, this week exceeded September 1929, when business conditions were good and people generally were pretty prosperous and it was not so difficult to place the books. It exceeded even the 150,000-Hour Week of last July, which had one more day than the 750,000 Testimonies Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The total literature placed by all classes and sharpshooters was 40,231 bound books and 139,235 booklets, making a total of 179,466 pieces of literature. During 150,000-IIour Week we placed only 174,450 pieces, and during IBSA Week in September 1929 we placed only 106,926 pieces. There were 9,015 workers who participated in the drive, averaging 9.1 hours. The workers out during the 150,000-IIour Week put in one-half hour more per worker. However, they had an additional day in which to do this. Consequently, instead of its reflecting unfavorably toward the present drive, it reflects favorably; for the workers , during the 9-day period qJ the 7511,• - 000 T esntnonies'Wcek put in 81,974 hours, whereas, in July, for 10 days the workers put in only 83,277 hours. This indicates that as time goes on the Lord’s people arc appreciating more the necessity for using all their faculties to magnify the name of Jehovah. The Lord blessed the efforts of Irie people this fall most remarkably: in the July drive the workers were able to place literature in an average of one home every hour and a half, while in this fall drive they placed literature in a little better than one home an hour. The total testimonies given by the classes and sharpshooters were 391,433. In other words, during this drive almost 400,000 people received definite testimonies pertaining to the Lord’s kingdom. This averaged 4.8 testimonies an hour. Of course, this work was done in urban territory and we cannot expect to maintain the same average th rough -out the year, because considerable work will have to be done in rural territory and when rurals arc worked the average of 4.8 testimonies an hour will not be maintained. However, we believe that 4 testimonies an hour can be maintained, for the additional number of homos that can be called on in city territory will make np for the time that will be lost in reaching the homes in the rural districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> combinations went splendidly, considering the hard times and the tightness of money throughout the country. There were 14,684 two-book combinations placed, and practically all of these were the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> books 1 and 2. Thore were 30,844 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> books placed all together. However, some of the friends seemed to get the idea that the only booklet they were to take during this drive was the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibition </span><span class="font2">booklet. Consequently, when the people did not accept the 95d combination of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> they dropped down to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibition</span><span class="font2"> booklet for 10f!, and in many instances placed only a 10;‘ booklet when they should have placed 4 for 25(5 or 9 for 50(1. This resulted in a big increase in the single-booklet placements, when we might have had quite a number of booklet combinations instead. It should be kept in mind in the future that our booklet combinations are much more attractive and will be taken much move readily bv the people than one booklet for 10(8- Two for 15(8 or 4 for 25(8 or 9 for 50^ are much more attractive. Therefore the friends should get the habit of presenting them in combinations rather than singly. However, (his is not intended to discourage anyone, but only to call attention to the possibility that we overlooked during this period; and knowing that each one wants to give the most effective witness possible, wc are making the above recommendation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of the above group figures, the English classes distributed 31,714 bound books and 106,071 booklets, or a total of 137,785 pieces. There were 6,627 English workers in the field, putting in 60,719 hours, or an average of 9.2 hours per worker. These workers placed literature in 71,720 homes, averaging about 1.2 placements an hour; and they gave 289,859 testimonies, or 4.8 testimonies every hour, and averaged one placement to every 4 testimonies. In other words, they -..laced the kingdom message in its ..rinted form in one out of everv four ■ * ♦</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Details of Quota in December Bulletin</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Looking for the Lord’s guidance in our future activities, and seeing that he has so richly blessed the efforts put forth during Testimonies Week, it seems that it would be pleasing to him to make this year’s quota on tiie testimonies basis rather than on books and booklets alone. It has been decided, therefore, to do this, setting as the quota 10,000,000 testimonies for the year which began October 1. From now on a careful record should be kept by all the workers of every testimony given, and every testimony given, ns well as books and booklets placed, should be reported; for 10,000,000 is a big number. We will tell you more about this quota and the plans for the year in the next </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since the quota is based on testimonies, it is essential that all the class workers, sharpshooters, colporteurs and class service committees have a clear understanding as to just what constitutes a testimony. Judging by some of the reports for 750,000 Testimonies Week, some arc still confused on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The special work which the anointed have been commissioned to do is to preach the Kingdom gospel as a witness. Therefore, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">each call where one is permitted to proceed far enough with his canvass to say something about the kingdom</span><span class="font2"> should be counted as one testimony, regardless of the number who listen to it. To do this it is not necessary to give a long-winded discourse, but one shonld be homes at which they were able to give a testimony.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">able to get to this point within a few had!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">The foreign classes placed 5,509 bound books and 26,959 booklets, making a total of 32,468 pieces. There were 2,143 workers participating, working 16,310 hours and averaging </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">7.6 </span><span class="font2">hours per worker. These placed literature in 16,465 different homes, or a little better than one home an hour. In Older to place this amount of literature they gave 82,387 testimonies, which averages 5.1 testimonies an hour. The foreign-speaking friends did better than the English-speaking friends as far as the number of testimonies per hour is concerned, but did not do so well from the standpoint of the number of testimonies required to place literature. The foreign friends were able to place literature in 1 out of every 5 homes where they testified, while the English friends were able to place literature in 1 out of every 4, However, tills should be no cause for discouragement. The foreign-speaking friends are handicapped in many respects, in that they have difficulty in locating the people who speak their language and the amount of literature in many of the foreign languages is limited to a. few books and booklets. In fact, taking all tilings into consideration, the foreign-speaking friends have much for which to be grateful to the Lord, because of the manner in which he used them to magnify his name in this drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The sharpshooters placed 3,008 (Continued on page 1, column 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">minutes. Moro time may be needed, of course, to develop the interest sufficiently for placing the books. This is the purpose of the full canvass. But if the call is interrupted and the interview closed before mention of the kingdom has been made, it should not be counted as a testimony. The only exception to this general rule would be in the case where a person takes the literature before the worker reached this point. In such a ease the leaving of the books or booklets with the party would be considered as completing the testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bemember, then, a testimony is counted each time the worker says something about the kingdom. If two or more persons happen to listen to the one presentation, it would be counted as one testimony only. Even if these two or more persons take books or one takes several sets to be used as presents for others, it would be considered as only one testimony given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Testimonies should be reported on the weekly report cards in tiie upper right-hand corner. For the colporteurs and sharpshooters there is ample space there on their cards. On the class cards report should be made in-this corner between the &quot;Language” line and the &quot;Brothers............Sisters............ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Light” Goes Very Well </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">329,417 Books and Booklets Placed</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You have been looking forward to the announcement of the results of 750,000 Testimonies Week, even as we have been keenly interested in tabulation of the final results. Due to the preparing of the annual report, this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font2"> has been somewhat delayed, so that we could give you the full information. And here it is: BEAD IT AND BE JOICE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since it was the first time to try counting testimonies, it was an uncertainty just how many colporteurs and class workers would be able to average an Lour. Thus the quota of 750,00(1 testimonies was not reached, although 661,781 were given. Some of the classes and colporteurs overlooked reporting them, and some did not report them correctly, all of which is rather to he expected for the first time a new idea is tried. It would be well, therefore, for everyone to read carefully the article in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font2"> telling just what a testimony is. Taking all in all, these oversights were only minor and cannot be considered as seriously detracting from the glorious success of this week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do you remember how hard we worked last May to place 300,000 pieces of literature, and then came short? Well, this time we went out ami worked hard with the sole idea of giving the witness to the honor of Jehovah’s name to as many people as possible, leaving the results with the Lord; and what happened? Out of the 661,781 testimonies given, 1(50,222 persons took some of the literature. This means that one out of every 4.13 persons to whom the witness was given took something and now have the witness in their homes in a permanent form. Not only did the Lord bless his people with this privilege, but the final results show- a total of 329,417 pieces of literature placed. The only week ever to surpass this one was 150,000-IIour Week, with its 10 days and a holiday, as compared with this 9-day week without a holiday. Now doesn’t that give you something to rejoice over? Doesn’t that make you feel like thanking the Lord for the privilege of representing him and his kingdom at this time of dire distress and need among the people? The total literature distributed during 150,000-IIour Week was 335,493, and for September 1929 IBSA Week was 251,670. Wliile there were 13,042 hours less time put in the service during Testimonies Week than during 150,000-nour Week, there were only 6,076 less pieces of literature placed and, surprising as it may seem, 19,692 more persons who took some of the literature. Thus it seems tliat the Lord’s blessings have been upon the efforts of his people to testify to Ills glory and to leave a substantial witness in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Class workers and colporteurs all tried hard to make their 5 testimonies per hour, and came very close to it. As shown by the table, the classes and auxiliaries averaged 4.8, while the pioneers, many of whom had to work in scattered territory, averaged 4.45. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> Books 1 and 2, saw a large distribution, as the friends joyfully entered into the work of bringing them to the attention of the people.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">For many years much publicity has been given to Brother Rutherford's lectures, both in large public meetings and over the air. Millions have listened in to the big chain network of radio stations and to the weekly broadcasts of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Totver’s </span><span class="font2">Sunday morning hour. People have packed theaters, auditoriums and coliseums, and frequently made necessary the placing of amplifiers on the streets so that all the crowd unable to get in might hear also. Thus Brother Rutherford has become internationally known and many people are interested in hearing what he has to say. This being true, the Society has decided to take advantage of the public interest created by this large . amount of advertising. To further the witness about God’s kingdom its radio service, featuring a Bible lecture by Brother Rutherford once every week, will be extended to cover the entire United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the past there have been thirty or more stations broadcasting his lectures, but now arrangements are made for broadcasting his talks over more than a hundred stations each week. This new arrangement will have two great advantages. First, the message of the truth will be broadcast to a far greater audience and more people will listen in; second, those that hear will be in a receptive mood to receive the canvasser, or the Lord’s witness, when he or she calls at the door. Many people ou earth today are seeking the, truth, and when they hear it they will recognize it as the truth from the Lord. This will give the remnant a better opportunity to leave the books with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">About a month ago a letter was sent to most of the classes, especially those that had a radio station in their own city, and these were asked to make an investigation in regard to broadcasting a fifteen-minute program every Sunday morning from 10: 00 to 10: 15 o’clock. Each program is to be an electrical transcription of Brother Rutherford’s lecture. The fifteenminute period will embrace an announcement introducing the speaker and will be followed by a thirteen-and-one-half-minutc lecture, which in every instance will be given by Brother Rutherford. These lectures are clear, concise, and to the point, and will bring to the listeners the facts and the truth on the particular subject being discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have not had a response from all of the classes respecting this letter, and we should appreciate hearing from all of them, whether or not they can obtain a station for this broadcast. The arrangements made up to the present time are very wonderful, and the United State? is covered from coast to coast. In the East, from 10:00 to 10:15 Eastern Standard Time there will be over forty stations on the air. The first lecture will be broadcast on December 7. Those who listen in in the Central states will have over thirty-five stations from which to choose. There will be over twenty stations in tlio Mountain and Pacific Time region sending forth the truth, beginning December 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This new arrangement for broadcasting the truth and preparing the field for the house-to-house witness work has caused great enthusiasm amongst the friends. They are anxious to advertise this new radio feature of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font2"> and the Society is arranging a special radio slip or folder, to be ready by the 17th of November. We hope that all the friends throughout the country will use these radio slips to advertise this watchtower program. The slip will carry a list of nil the stations broadcasting the program, and will be offered to the friends at $1.00 a thousand. As we can print these on our large presses in quantities of cue million at a time, it will be possible for us to</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Colporteurs Again Do Big Things</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Testimony Week Filled</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Pioneer and Auxiliary Report</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Most Interesting</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Once more the colporteurs, pioneer and auxiliary, joyfully grasped the opportunity of demonstrating to the Lord that they have taken a positive stand on his side and desire to be right in the thick of every fight in which his name is involved. Although Satan’s agents threatened a big counter attack during 750,000 Testimonies Week, we have heard of no workers encountering any of the representatives of the International Council of Churches out distributing their literature as they planned to do in their “religious educational” week. The Lord said that his people would be willing in the day of his power; but apparently the Devil is not finding his people quite so willing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The colporteurs seized upon the “testimonies” idea with enthusiasm. Many of the pioneers did not have so much urban territory in which to work, so found it difficult to maintain the average of 5 testimonies an hour. They did very well, however, averaging 4.45. The auxiliaries averaged 4.8, which was possible for them on account of the large number of them who were located in urban territory, where they could make more calls. In all, 270,348 testimonies were given by the colporteurs, of which number the pioneers gave 191,026 and the auxiliaries 79,322. It is very gratifying to report that 1,124 pioneers participated in this special work, and 775 auxiliaries. While this means that the number of pioneers was 22 less than during 150,000-Hour Week, there were 25 more auxiliaries. The week being only 9 days instead of 10, the pioneers averaged only 38.17 hours each, as compared with 45.86 during 150,000-Ilour Week. Thus the total number of hours in the work dropped from 52,559 to 42,904. However, comparing Testimonies Week with IBSA Week of last year, which was also a 9-day period, reveals that the pioneers showed a big improvement. At that time the 997 reporting averaged only 37.86 hours, which resulted in a total of 37,756 hours for the week. The auxiliaries put in 16,530 hours during Testimonies Week, or an average of 21.33. Tills is better than the quota which was set for 150,000-IIour Week, but is less than the 18,614 hours reported at that time. WTien the results are compared with IBSA Week of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">September 1929, </span><span class="font2">at which time </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">456 </span><span class="font2">supply the friends with them at this low price, even though they are going to be considerably larger than the ones used heretofore. No special slips will be printed by the Society for certain local sections. Our purpose is to advertise the watchtower program, and not any individual stations. The pioneer colporteurs also can use these slips in their territory, and we are granting them a special rate, in accordance with our regular policy of bearing part of the pioneers’ burden. The Society is glad to do this so that the pioneer colporteurs also may have the use of them. Please order these slips when you order your books, so that we can ship them by freight.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Them with Enthusiasm</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">auxiliaries averaged only 20,44 hours, making a total of 9,322, you can better appreciate the zeal and enthusiasm of the auxiliaries’ response. This spirit is a real inspiration to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And now for the results in books placed. During September we had received so many letters telling us of the difficulties in placing books, because of the hard times, that wc were really amazed when we saw that in spite of these conditions both the pioneers and the auxiliaries placed more literature in the hands of the people than during the fall IBSA Week of 1929. Think of it, 149,951 pieces of literature for Testimonies Week, as compared with 103,165 for September 1929 IBSA Week! Of this number the pioneers placed 36,120 books aud 76,078 booklets. The auxiliaries distributed 10,086 books and 27,667 booklets. There was a substantial gain in the number of placements also, increasing from a total of 43,322, during IBSA Week of September 1929, to 67,373. This represents an increase in the number of placements per hour for the pioneers from ,91 to 1.13; and for the auxiliaries, from .96 to 1.15. These placements averaged more booklets and fewer books than heretofore. In 1929 the average number of books per hour for the pioneers was 1.27, and of booklets, .96; whereas this year the averages were, books ,84, and booklets j.77. The auxiliaries averaged during IBSA Week 1929, books 1.02, booklets .95; whereas during Testimonies Week they averaged, books .61, booklets 1.67, The really encouraging feature of this report is the substantial gain made in these averages over placements made during the past few months. Considering that during the month of September the averages per hour for the pioneers were, placements .76, books .85, and booklets ,1.26, this increase in hourly results is a real encouragement. The auxiliaries averaged at that time, placements .74, books .51, and booklets 1.29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The introduction of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> to the public was an inspiration. The pioneers placed a total of 10,048 Book One and 9,841 Book Two. The auxiliaries placed 3,761 Book One and 3,687 Book Two. It should be remembered that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> should be placed singly only when an order is given to bring the second book at some later date. It is unfair to the people to leave them with an incomplete article, as is the case if they do not have the two books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The radio will be a means for breaking down the prejudice aroused by Satan’s lies and misrepresentations. It will be used to let the people know that Jehovah is God and that he has a class of people who are faithfully serving him by carrying the Kingdom message to tbe people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We feel sure that with this splendid arrangement for a wider use of the radio the field will yield greater results in response to the efforts of the workers and a greater witness will be given. The coming year, with the Lord’s blessing, the new books </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font2">iu fact all the literature that the Lord has prepared for his remnant to use in advertising the King and the kingdom, we feel sure will bo a most blessed year. We think of the words of the psalmist: “This is the day which the 1.0'd hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity. ’ ’ —Ps. 118: 24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Continued from page 1, column 4) those totals indicate the extent of the witness which has been given. Colporteurs placed these books during the past year in every state in the Union, in Alaska, Cuba, Canal Zone, Costa Rica, Dutch Guiana, Haiti, Panama and Honduras. The work they have done has been amongst people of many different nationalities, there being pioneer colporteurs who themselves are of the following: Armenian, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Jewish, Lettish, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Swiss, Syrian and Ukrainian. While many of these have been working among the English-speaking people, they have also done good work among people of their own nationality in this country. Thus it is seen that the Lord is having this kingdom gospel preached unto all nations as a witness and that the pioneers are determined and anxious to do their part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Transferring Books Between Classes and Colporteurs </span><span class="font2">Considerable confusion and duplication. of transfers have occurred, due to colporteurs<sup>f</sup> and classes * not having followed the instructions regarding- the making of transfers of books, even after having received permission front this office to do so. Wc ask all class service committees and colporteurs to read these instructions carefully and follow them in the future, in the hope of eliminating mistakes. 1. Before transferring books affecting the two or more accounts at this office, whether such transfers be between colporteurs or between colporteurs and classes, permission to do so should first be received from this office. The reason for this is that some colporteurs and classes allow their accounts to run close to the credit limit, making an additional charge to their accounts unwise.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">2. After having obtained permission to make this transfer, a list of the books which are turned over should be signed by both parties involved, the one receiving the books and the one giving them. This one and only one notice should be sent to the Society. When each party separately notifies us of the transfer there is a likelihood of the same transaction <sup>J</sup>s being entered twice. Therefore please remember that in the future, unless tho notice to</span></p>

However, in some eases there were 2 and as high as 4 working with some of the sharpshooters, so that probably the total sharpshooters out for the drive would he about 500. These 500 sharpshooters worked 4,945 hours, or almost 10 hours per worker. This is exceptionally good. They placed literature in 4,664 homes. This is slightly less than one home an hour, but so close that it averages almost that. They gave 19,187 testimonies, or an average of about 4 testimonies an hour, and placed literature on an a verage of 1 out of 4 testimonies, maintaining the same general average that the classes did. We think that this is remarkable, because the sharp shoot era are situated in isolated sections of the country, many of them rill alone and no one to associate or fellowship with, either in study meetings or in field activity; hut even situated in this way, the Lord is pleased to bless and strengthen those who are willing to be used by him to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every drive seems to indicate closer cooperation between the different branches of the Lord's organization, so that practically to a man the entire organization goes forward at the command of the Lord. This is as it should be. Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is unity, peace and cooperation. It gives us much Joy to he able to report such a splendid witness in vindication of the Lord’s name and of tlie establishment of his kingdom at this time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The placements per hour for the above are 1.2. In other words, the average for all classes throughout the United States was 1.2 placements an hour, or literature placed in a little better than one home an hour. The English and foreign friends averaged the same in this respect, showing that the foreign-speaking friends are able to place literature just as effectively as the English-speaking. This should be encouraging to all concerned, because it emphasizes the big fact that this work we are doing is the Lord’s work and that weather conditions, business depression or anything else that the Devil may strive to do, shall in no wise hinder it. The above total represents 2,173,271 pieces of literature placed in 1,105,739 homes in the United States. There are about twenty-four million families in this country. Between eight million and nine million of these are assigned to the different classes, the colporteurs handling the other fifteen million or more. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Placing </span><span class="font2">literature </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font2">1,105,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">homes </span><span class="font2">throughout the past year represents about one-ninth of the families assigned to the classes who received the message in its permanent form, rep- ; resented in the books. For every placement made, four homes received a definite canvass, according to the figures that we were able to get from the 750,000 Testimonies Week. One out of every four testimonies represents a placement. Using that us a basis, then, it would mean that practically four and a half million people received a definite witness from the classes and sharpshooters during the past year. However, only 25 percent of those who were definitely witnessed to took the books. Undoubtedly during the next year a good percentage of those people will recognize the testimony they received was true and depicted the actual conditions that exist in the world today and these will be glad to avail themselves of the privilege of getting some of the literature the next time you go over the territory. The time is here when the words of God’s prophet are finding a partial fulfilment at least, where he says regarding God's servant that the “priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts ’ ’. The work the anointed are doing now is not simply giving a witness for today and then going away and never expecting to see the people again, bnt rather, definitely arranging and planning to visit every home in the territory two or three times a year with the kingdom message. Letters are daily coming to the office telling us of people who have been waiting for the friends to bring them this kingdom message. They are seeking the truth at the mouth of God’s messenger.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">service, which widens the scope of Brother Rutherford’s lectures to many times the number of radio stations that were included in the chain hookup, will undoubtedly do much more in preparing the field for the workers. Therefore, each one should get a proper perspective and stimulus from the manner in which the Lord used his people during the past year and determino by his grace to use their every faculty in giving the testimony for the coming year. The responsibility for the amount of literature placed cannot be properly placed upon the individual worker, because so many conditions are involved. However, the giving of the testimony is something that the Lord definitely commits to his people. A ‘ ‘ testimony ’ ’ literally means to give witness or testimony regarding a point at issue. The great point to be determined now is whether the word and name of Jehovah God is to be vindicated, and testimony given that he is worthy of the respect and allegiance of his creatures. This testimony must be borne to the people that they may determine on wimt side of tills issue they are going to take their stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If all the workers maintain the same degree of activity that they did during the past year, averaging 4.3 hours per worker, that would mean 225 hours for each individual for the entire year. If the class workers average 4 testimonies an hour, that would represent 900 testimonies for each one during the coming year. Surely this cannot be termed anything but a reasonable service and is the least that any of the Lord’s people who are physically able to participate in the service work should render unto him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Continued from page I, eolwim 4) appreciate what this amount of time represents; for many of the auxiliary colporteurs are housewives with families to take care of, men in business who snatch an hour here and an hour there in their effort to put in the twelve hours weekly along with their efforts to provide the things needful for their dependents, elderly people who, in spite of their infirmities, are determined to use every ounce of their fast-fading strength to the honor of Jehovah’s name, yes, and even some young folks who are still in school but who love the Lord and would rather siug forth his praises than be out playing after school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Like the pioneers, the auxiliaries because of the more determined effort put forth during 1930, were able to place more literature in the hands of the people than ever before. Even though during the year previous several weeks were devoted to circulating the 5£ booklets exclusively, the total pieces of literature placed in 1930 numbered 535,369, as compared with 487,841 in 1929. Of this number, 194,714 were books, instead of only 158,099, as in 1929. Ten-cent booklets jumped from 157,713 to 292,368, and, of course, the 5c booklets decreased, from 172,029 to 48,287. This is truly a remarkable record and means that during a year when worldly organizations have been taking losses the Lord’s work has seen another remarkable increase. Surely the Lord’s doings are wonderful in our eyes.</span></p>

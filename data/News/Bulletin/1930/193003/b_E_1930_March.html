<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>January Work a Decided Increase Over 1929</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">As we review the results of the class activities in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Prophecy </span><span class="font6">Campaign” we are reminded of the statement of the Lord through his prophet, “The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.” Not great In numbers, nor great according to this world’s standards, but. great in the Lord and the power of Ids might. A truly Kingdom people, whom neither man nor devil, nor unfavorable weather . conditions, c.m bold back from doing what they know to be God’s will for them. Never before was such a mighty midwinter campaign put on, and the success attending it was so evidently a mark of the Lord’s approval and blessing that each one who had part in it has much to feel grateful for. Every branch of the service, the English classes, the colored classes, the foreign-speaking classes, and the sharpshooters, showed up wonderfully! For tbs encouragement of all we here show a brief comparison of the distribution of books by the classes during the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy </span><span class="font6">drive, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font6"> drive, and January 1929.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">All books for whole month</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">January 1929 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16,704</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At first glance it might seem as though the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font6"> drive beat the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font6"> drive all hollow; but when it is kept in mind that last September all the auxiliary colporteurs were included with the classes, and are not now included, it reduces the margin to less than three thousand, and the further fact that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font6"> campaign was held in September, which is by far the best month of the year, and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font6"> drive in January, the worst month of the year, the results cannot be viewed as other than marvelous and “the Lord’s doing”. We want to make special mention of the foreign-speaking classes and the sharpshooters because in the amount of literature placed each show a decided increase over that in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life </span><span class="font6">drive in September. We rejoice greatly iu this, for we realize that those speaking other than the English language have a much more difficult time than the American brethren. Likewise the sharpshooters, who are, generally, isolated brethren letting their lights shine, without the encouragement and help that comes from association with a number of brethren. We are sure the Lord especially strengthened these brethren and blessed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The January activities of the classes was a decided increase over those of January 1929, also. As indicated on the table, you have placed over 34 percent of your bound books in 33-1/3 percent of the time, and about 25 percent of the booklet quota in 33-1/3 percent of the time, mid tb<sup>1</sup>s <sup>H</sup>-■■■■' been accorc.pligtmd during the worst weather and shortest days. What will it be when the weather clears up ? After coming so far short in our former estimate as we evidently shall, we are reluctant to even give a guess. But this simply goes to prove how literally and completely the Lord fulfils his promise to his anointed, “Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Several colporteurs have written to us recently saying that they have offered it and have met with very favorable results. In fact, their experience has been that they have been able to place the entire set of seven books and nine booklets as easily as they have the seven books alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This having been their experience, we know that the colporteurs will be glad to know about it; and therefore we ore suggesting to them that during the months of March and April they take up the work with the $2.90 combination. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are so many good talking points in its favor that we do not see why it should not succeed. It</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why ^at Write *Us about the Co/porteur Service?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Set of Seven Going Great Placing 76 as Compared with 47 in January</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">What did the colporteurs do during </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font6"> week? Here it is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reports for the week were received from 889 pioneers and 494 auxiliaries. Of 12,811, the total number of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font6"> placed, the pioneers distributed 8,145, and the auxiliaries 4,666. During the week 1,758 sets of seven books were placed by all the colporteurs. The total number of. cloth-bound books was 39,863, of which 32,485 were put out by the pioneers, and 7,378 by the auxiliaries. Besides these, 24,488 teu-cent booklets and 4,997 five-cent booklets were left in the hands of the people, making a grand total of 69,359 different pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now what do you think of that for a little band of workers battling against such odds as severe weather conditions, ice and snow, rain and mud, sleet and icy pavements, and hard times for the people? These hard times are causing many to desire to hear the comforting message; and correspondingly greater becomes the privilege of the anointed to comfort their hearts with God’s answer to their questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These results show what really can be done during the wintertime. Isn’t that much better than “hibernating like an old bear”, as we used to think it necessary to do? The anointed are coming to realize that this Kingdom Gospel must be preached; and cold weather will no more keep them from doing their part than Nebuchadnezzar’s threat to chuck the three Hebrews into the. fiery furnace could frighten them into submission.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font6">is particularly desirable in working scattered territory with an automobile, where it Is difficult to make very many calls a day. One thing sure, if the offer is not made, the book and booklet combination will not be placed, and many of the colporteurs have found that when they talk books they place books; when they talk booklets, they place booklets. Therefore, if we talk such a combination for $2.90 isn’t it reasonable to suppose that such will be (Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">These results are especially gratifying when it is realized that during this nine-day period the pioneers reporting averaged 30.04 hours in the field, and the auxiliaries 15.23 hours, as compared with the averages for the rest of the month of January, which were, for the pioneers only 15.79 hours a week, and for the auxiliaries only 7.96 hours. As a consequence, during this nine-day period the pioneers were able to place almost half as many books as they did during tb' p-x.ceflirg four weeks of January, and the auxiliaries placed 7,378, as compared with 8,588 during the previous four weeks, From this you can see that when we try to encourage the workers to be regular in the field and to maintain the time requirements which have been set (a minimum of 12 hours a week for the auxiliaries, and at least 25 to 30 hours a week for pioneers) it is really to their interest, as well as that of the Kingdom, for them to do so. It is always evident that the Lord’s special blessing is upon those who are seeking first the interests of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another encouraging feature, of the report is the increase in the number of sets which were placed by the pioneers, proving that the new offer is appreciated by the public. During the four weeks of January, 2,918 sets of six or seven were distributed, (A few of the pioneers were a little too early in offering the set of seven, and 55 sets were reported before drive week.) During the drive week of nine days 1,591 sets of seven, and 440 sets of six, or a total of 2,031 sets, were reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In other words, during January the pioneers placed sets at an average rate of .047 of a set an hour, whereas during </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font6"> week they placed them at the rate of .076 of a set an hour. This means that with the new prices in effect there was an actual increase of practically 62 percent for the drive week, on the hourly basis. Stating the same thing In another way, 76 sets were placed in the same length of time as it previously took for placing 47! Surely this indicates that the Lord is pleased with the new reduction in prices in order that a greater witness might be given to the honor of his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The weather has so changed that March and April are excellent months for canvassing. In most sections of the country the mild spring weather conies very early in March. Therefore March and April is the time to finish portions of your city territory that you were unable to work during the cold winter months; siagle homes, the fairly prosperous sections, and outlying districts. In fact, all the odds and ends of territory that were not worked during the winter should be cleaned up by IBSA Week, so that everything will then be in readiness to inaugurate your spring campaign in the larger towns and cities in your assignment with the IBSA Week drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The seven books by Brother Rutherford for $2.40 should be the chief offer during this period. Where they cannot be placed, a book and booklet combination should be presented. Do not overlook the importance of offering booklets where the bound books cannot be placed. Many homes where the message in booklet form might be left are in effect overlooked simply because the friends do not present the booklets as a final offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(Continued from page 1, column 3) placed? We think so, and those who have tried It say that it works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now then, in working up a canvass for such a combination it is not necessary for one to say something about each one of the books and booklets; for to do so would make the canvass too long. Rather, center the canvass upon the entire combination, using one or two of the books and booklets for demonstration purposes. It can then be pointed out how obtaining the entire combination is really to the interest of the party doing so; for if the books and booklets were to be obtained singly, they would amount to $3.55 or $3.60, according to the booklets used. It can be pointed out how such a set Is so much more convenient than one large book or several large books containing the same information. All members of the family can enjoy them at the same time. If the party wants to have something good to read during his lunch hour, he can stick one of the booklets in his pocket and take it to work with him. If the housewife is busy during the daytime, and has a few minutes to spare, she can sit down while she is catching her breath, pick up a booklet, and get some real encouragement for the rest of the day. Then when evening comes and the day’s work is done, the books can be read with much enjoyment. If at any time one wants to look up something special, the topical index in the back of the books is conveniently arranged. When some neighbor comes in and they get into an interesting discussion with him, they have something they can lend him, or a booklet which they can give him, in proof of the point they have made. It can also be shown how the children can be allowed to read the booklets and how the bound books can be kept in good condition for their own use without being damaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some have asked about what booklets should be used to make up the combination of nine. The fol-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Pioneers Asked to Give Full Information in Making Out Territory Reports</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Some of the</span><span class="font6"> pioneer colporteurs have been overlooking the questions asked opposite the advance information on their territory assignment sheets. This information is very necessary in order that we may give the next colporteur to whom the territory is assigned the benefit of your experience. Of necessity the information which we are able to obtain here at this office is not up to date; and if the colporteur who works the territory will take a few additional minutes to tell us about the conditions there by answering the questions on the territory sheet, it will be a great benefit to the next worker who may know nothing about the county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are now preparing special maps which will indicate at a glance the centers of population, the road conditions, and the best season of the year to work each county. When these have been completed we shall be able to give you more advance information about the territory when you write in for recommendations of that which is open. In order to develop this system, which will take a grea t deal of work hut which we believe will be a great help in getting the territory worked at the most favorable seasons of the year, it will be necessary to enlist the aid of all the pioneers who have been given county assignments. They can give us this assistance by filling out each county sheet completely, giving all the information requested.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The following letters might give some of the colporteurs a timely suggestion for working rural territory where .the people are hard up for money. They show what can be done if one is seeking to make the most of every opportunity and to leave the kingdom message In the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here’s one from a sister who is working in a territory where the people are very poor and the preachers are trying to arouse opposition. She writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We are having great joy in the work. The preachers are getting warmed up, but it only makes the people take the books. One preacher make the remark that those books had a wider circulation than any other. You could hardly find a home without them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">be a great stimulus to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> articles on &quot;Tbe Royal House” are stirring up those who really love the I si rd as never before. During the last month, there has been a great increase in the number of applicants for information about the colporteur work, biti.ii pioneer and auxiliary. From one class alone 20 sent in their i names at one time as desiring to j join the ranks. Some of tbe smaller i classes have enrolled practically 100-: percent as the friends have come to realize that the time is here to make haste with the preaching of tiiis kingdom gospel which must be preached. 208 applications have been mailed out during tbe month</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Asked to Order in Multiples of Eight</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course the colporteurs will desire to have some of the attractive J'lashtone cartons which have been secured for IBSA Week; but instead of sending any of these on consignment this year, we are asking all the colporteurs, auxiliaries as well as pioneers, to place their own orders. The cartons are not shipped without the sets of “jr” liacked in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This early notice is given so as to enable each colporteur to get: his order in in time, and to make it of sufficient size to weigh 100 pounds, the minimum for freight shipment. As eight sets of “Jr” in Flashtones nicely fill one large carton, it will eliminate a great deal of extra work here if each one will order them In multiples of eight sets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The colporteurs may obtain the Flashtone cartons at 5c each. This is not to be added to the retail rate of $2.40 for the set; the set in the carton is to be offered to the public at the same price, as a special feature of tills drive week. It is anticipated that, as a consequence, the increase in the number which are placed will more than offset the additional cost to the worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last May IBSA Week, when the special cartons were used for the set of five, there was a decided increase in the number placed, indicating that the special offer was appreciated by the public.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Brooklyn and Depot Shipping Service Improved</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">On February 10 the Chicago depot was discontinued. About the same time a letter of instructions was sent to all the class directors, stockkeepers, colporteurs, and sharpshooters, and we hope that all received those instructions in regard to shipping. If you did not receive a copy, please write us. The Society now has three, shipping points, Brooklyn, St. Louis, and Oakland; and at these three points we have made arrangements to give the friends better service than heretofore, and we hope it will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">more </span><span class="font6">service too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been some misunderstanding in regard to those who are living in territory such as Montana, North Dakota, Texas and Oklahoma. These friends are wondering why it is necessary to send their orders all the way to Brooklyn. If orders are sent to Brooklyn we can take care of all the labels, cheeking of prices, checking of accounts, etc., which the depots cannot do. If a colporteur or class director sends an order to Brooklyn requesting that shipment be made from tire St. Louis depot because they need their books in a hurry, well be glad to do this, and it means a difference of only about two days’ more time before shipment is made from St. Louis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Orders</span><span class="font6"> are given </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font6"> attention here at. Brooklyn, and every evening we mail labels to Oakland and St. Louis to be filled there. In special eases we use air mail. It takes only a little over a day for the labels to reach St. Louis; and if the brother in charge there does not have to make out labels and invoices he can fill the order immediately and get it to the freight depot. We hope that all who have anything to do with ordering literature will, in every instance possible, send their orders to the Brooklyn office, and also order enough books and booklets to make shipments in hundred-pound lots. We appreciate very much what the friends have been doing In this regard in the last month, because considerable saving has been made already; but it can be Improved even more, and we desire your cooperation. In most cases now, if your order is received here in the morning it will be delivered to the freight depot the next morning, when shipped from Brooklyn, and thereafter the responsibility to get it to you rests with the railroads. However, the competition between railroads in hauling freight has lie-come so keen within the last few years that most of them are giving excellent service, and in a good many cases express and mail will not gain very much time on freight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are looking forward to this year with anticipation, and expect to ship more books and booklets than ever before.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Are You Ready for the Big Spring Rush?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">All the Anointed Expected to Participate</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Your Plans Now</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first IBSA Week this year, commencing April 2f&gt; and ending May </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4,</span><span class="font6"> is almost here. Do you know what you plan to do during that week? Has the service committee gotten together and made the preliminary plans, such as choosing the territory to be worked (the larger towns on good roads) ? Have they “spied out the land”, zoning it so that they will know how many workers it will require and how it can be worked to the best advantage? Have they mapped out evening canvassing? Commencing with the first Sunday morniug of IBSA Week “daylight-saving time” goes into effect in many sections of the country. This enables the people to be released from their business and complete the evening meal while it is still daylight. In fact, there will be between two and a half and three hours of daylight after work which can be used for canvassing in these sections, and one and a half to two hours in sections where they do not use the daylight-saving scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Particular consideration should be given to the presentation and canvass for the Flashtone cartons. One reason why some of the friends are more successful than others is that they give careful consideration to detail. Therefore every class should spend at least the two service meetings prior to IBSA Week in a detailed discussion of ways and means for making the campaign a success. The following order may be used:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. Having determined upon the territory to be worked, (a) What were former experiences when working it? (b) What were the main difficulties encountered? (c) How can these difficulties be effectively overcome? (d) What classes of people are in the territory? (e) When can they be worked to the best advantage?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. How are tlie nine days going to l&gt;e distributed? There are two Saturdays and two Sundays. For these four days territory should be chosen in which people live who are paid weekly and on Friday or Saturday. (Discreet inquiries among storekeepers will enable you to get much valuable information in this connection.) Monday and Tuesday (especially iii the forenoon) is the ideal time to work the business districts. Wednesday. Thursday, and Friday are the day's to work the professional and better-class districts and sections where government, hotel, railway clerical and executive, and institutional employees live who get paid monthly or semi-monthly. These people receive their salary either Wednesday the 30th or Thursday the 1st. There will then be money in the home and on the individual; so the outline of the campaign should provide not only for canvassing those homes on the days mentioned, but also for canvassing office workers during noon hour and other available periods, and evening work among the employees of such institutions as are .in your territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Idle foregoing is a suggested outline and will, of course, vary according to local conditions. However, if the conditions are freely discussed at tire service meetings and each one constitutes himself a committee of one to get all the information possible, the campaign will be a greater success and much “beating of the air” will be eliminated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s blessing upon any one thing is a definite indication that the Lord Is pleased with that thing. Each IBSA Week brings forth additional evidence of the Lord’s blessing upon this method. It provides a definite starting period for the spring campaign, world-wide In its scope. Every one of God’s anointed should devote all the time possible to Held service during this week. If possible, get released from your secular, home, or other duties for the entire period. If not, get at least two or three days in addition to the two Saturday afternoons and Sundays; or, counting two Saturday afternoons as one day, two Sundays as two more, making three, two or three additional days devoted to the Kingdom witness would make a five- or six-day week out of the nine. We believe it can lie done; and if each one who cannot see the. way opeu to devote this amount of time to field service, and really wants to go out, will take it to the Lord in prayer and watch for and take advantage of such openings as he provides, we believe the Lord will indeed open the way. Consider the difficulties he enabled the friends to overcome to make the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font6"> drive a success. Consider the difficulties lie is enabling a great many to overcome who are entering the colporteur service (as outlined in the February </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin),</span><span class="font6"> and kuow that he will do the same for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite the fact that the increased activity in the field is making increasingly greater demands upon the factory force at Brooklyn, Brother Rutherford feels that this spring campaign is of such importance that he has authorized the closing of the office, factory and home from Thursday evening May 1 to Monday morning May 5 so that a canvass? (e) Is it successful? If not, what is wrong with it? Canvasses should be discussed at the service meetings: successful canvasses for the benefit of those who are unsuccessful, and poor cauvasses for the purpose of correcting them. In some cases brethren with a poor canvass will not discuss their canvasses at the service meeting because their pride will not permit them to admit that theirs is inferior. They are willing to continue with an ineffective canvass and permit the Lord’s work to suffer rather than have it discussed and its weak points eradicated. This cannot be pleasing to the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A discussion of these matters will not only make drive week a great success but will also make service meeting the most beneficial and interesting meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Four and One-half Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the members of the Bethel family may be permitted to have four and a half days’ field service with the rest of the Lord’s anointed. This includes the Saturday half day and Sunday in the beginning of the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He has further authorized supplying service leaders to all classes east of Cleveland, Ohio, and north of Richmond, Va., for the above days, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, May 2, 3 and 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last year we were barely able to supply brethren to all the classes requesting field service leaders, and the indications are that the demand this year will be greater; In fact, we have some requests already. Therefore arrangements have been made to supply leaders to classes in New York state south of Albany, in New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and in Pennsylvania east of Harrisburg during the Saturday and Sunday of April 26 and 27. This will release the brethren for the far-away points the following week-end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’The brethren sent out on these appointments are instructed to lead the friends in the field service during the day and conduct service meetings or address the friends in the evening. Friday and Saturday evening meetings should be devoted to completing arrangements for the following day’s work, and Sunday afternoon to a closing discourse on singing forth the honor of Jehovah's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The above arrangement applies to all languages, us long as wo have brethren for that service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Please write us promptly if it is the wish of your class to have one of the Bethel brethren with you on this drive. When it is delayed too long proper arrangements cannot be made to give the best service.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">2, 3 Hours in These Nine Days</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">While we have already had two special drive weeks this year, the really big IBSA Week is yet to come. The dates set are for the nine days from April 20 to May 4. It's to be the only IBSA Week for the fiscal period, since the fall IBSA Week doesn’t begin until September 27, which will mean that its results will be tabulated in the 1931 report. Consequently all of the Lord's anointed will be specially anxious to make this spring drive the best one ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To do this will mean some real work for the colporteurs. Yon have been doing so well during the past drives that “you will have to go some” to surpass former records. But we think that you can do it, if each one makes the matter a subject of prayer and then puts forth the effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What are the possibilities? This year, Instead of only eight days for the drive, there will be nine. Last year 1,040 pioneers averaged 37.86 hours for the week in the field, and 474 auxiliaries averaged 18.51. With the added day’s time surely these averages should be increased to 43 and 23 hours, respectively. Of course, to make averages as high as these will mean that more hours will have to be given by some in order to make up for those who, due to sickness, are unable to be in the work. The figures show that tile more time that is given to the work, the greater is the witness given and the more books placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last year the Flashtone cartons were used to good advantage. 4,529 sets of five were placed by the pioneers, and 932 by the auxiliaries. This year two new books containing the message of the hour in very attractive bindings have been added to the combination at the price increase of only that of one book. These are to be offered during this week in another beautiful Flashtone earton. With these advantages over last year, of more time for the work, more books at more favorable prices, and we expect to report more colporteurs participating, surely this drive should result in the jilacing of as many sets of seven this year as were placed of the sets of five last year. If this is done, it will mean an increase of over 9,000 books for the pioneers, and over 1,800 for the auxiliaries, provided, of course, the other combinations placed remain the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now this may appear easy, on paper, but to do it is a ilifferenl tiling. We realize flint it means some real hard work on the part of the colporteurs. But then, if the I,ord’s work isn’t worth our giving our very best, nothing is. Many people work much harder merely to eke out a hare existence at secular (Continued on page 4, column 4) the monthly activity to dale, undoubtedly we shall reach Ilie 300,600 figure. Let us all shoot nt 300,000 and see what will be the results. The Lord will give us the victory If we do our part, that is certain. Total workers out last year, 8,548. How many this year?</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Increased Efficiency Makes Possible the Reduction</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">We are in receipt of a few letters from the classes asking about the Stock they liad on hand January 25, when the new prices went into effect, We are answering these through the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font6"> that all may be conversant with the arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the revision of prices was considered the item of primary importance was, of course, to increase tile magnitude of the witness by permitting the people to get the message at the lowest possible rates. This involved the reduction of both the wholesale and the retail rates; the reduction on the wholesale rates on all literature shipped after January 1, 1930, to be borne by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To accomplish this reduction required a very careful study of the manufacturing, shipping, and distribution of the literature. It was found that if the output volume could be increased to a certain point we would be enabled to effect a saving in the raw material, because of the increased amount we purchased. Modern bookmaking machinery had been purchased and installed which resulted in an increased output and another reduction. Then the matter of shipping literature was gone into, very exhaustively, one depot was eliminated, and the classes and colporteurs were asked to cooperate in ordering; so another reduction was effected. Next, the estimate for the coming year was tackled, and the proposition of an Increased distribution at a lower rate carefully weighed, and it was found that if we could manufacture and distribute so much literature we could effect the above savings and thus enable the books and booklets to go to the people at a reduced cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order to do this, cooperation in purchasing, cooperation of every machine and Its operator, cooperation of the classes and colporteurs in ordering, are all essential; and, In fact, we figured to a certain extent in another avenue of cooperation. We knew that literature manufactured prior to this readjustment, which was made under the former conditions, would have to be placed with the classes at a loss. However, the Society determined to bear the loss on all literature in stock at Brooklyn and the depots, and we hoped the classes would be willing to bear a little of the burden because of Stock that they might have on hand after the new retail rates went into effect. In no instance, however, have the new retail rates been reduced to less than the former wholesale prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the bound volumes, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, . Deliverance,</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font6"> were shipped ; and charged to the classes at a lower rate than at present. Thus the adjustment worked to the advantage of the classes on these books. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font6"> is the same as formerly. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font6"> was charged at the new rate, leaving only </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Creation </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font6"> upon which any further reduction could be made; and we believe that the saving on </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life </span><span class="font6">will in almost all cases offset the Increase in these two. Therefore there did not seem to be any real reason to go to the trouble and ad-j ditional bookkeeping necessary to make adjustments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The same condition applies to the booklets, particularly when a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font6"> may be included in the combinations. The 2 for 16c, 4 for 25c, and 6 for 40c, will in every case enable the worker to receive for the books what was paid to the Society for them. Even the 9 for 50c will, in practically all cases, enable the classes to get their money back, because of the inclusion of a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font6"> and one or two booklets which were purchased at the later rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We know that none of the class workers are desirous of making a profit out of the Kingdom message, and that this matter will adjust itself in a month or so; therefore no arrangements have been made to readjust the accounts. However, if there are any classes upon whom this will work a hardship, we shall be glad to hear from them,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Placing </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are still a goodly number of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font6"> booklet in the hands of the classes. These should be placed in the hands of the people as soon as possible. Many of the friends seem to have overlooked or forgotten the importance of the message this booklet contains. Its opening statement is to the effect that the name of Jehovah shall he vindicated. That is its primary object. Until this takes place in the minds of the people they can not appreciate their true and greatest friend. The Lord had this message prepared and placed in the hands of his people, and from the moment it is received until it is distributed it constitutes a kingdom interest for which we are responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely every one of the anointed mnst have been impressed with the statement of the first subtitle, “A DECLARATION AGAINST SATAN AND FOR JEHOVAH.” Every person in your assignment is entitled to know the contents of this booklet so that they may see the issue and take their stand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">“One home offered me a six-week-old calf for the set. Another wanted to trade three opossum hides for books. It is great to see how the common people are looking for something better.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another colporteur writes us the following amusing incident:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I was just finishing my canvass and was about to tell the price of the books when a nice fat hen flew through the window and lit on the bed. I looked at the hen and said, ‘Lady there sits the price of the books,’ She said, ‘By all means catch that hen.’ I did, and thirteen others at different places.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It takes real faith to be a pioneer; but all those who have that faith and are diligent in the work will testify that the Lord is true to his promise to provide the things necessary if they do their part.</span></p>

Our only reason for encouraging them In this Is that a greater witness might be given to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following letter received from a colporteur indicates what a good work the booklets sire doing:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I placed a Bible with a man who, three months ago, threw every Bible he could get hold of into the waste basket because of the misrepresentation of its teachings by the preachers. He picked up a copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Oppression,</span><span class="font6"> by Brother Rutherford, from the hotel office desk, thinking, ‘I’ll read this just to see what those Bible Students have to say, anyway,’ for he had an Intense hatred of anything having any connection with the Bible. He did not lay It down until he had read it all; then he remembered a set of books that a friend had given him </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Studies in the Scriptures)</span><span class="font6"> published by the same people (IBSA).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Oppression</span><span class="font6"> had opened his eyes! He has read and studied them all since, also </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font6"> and is taking the later books and rejoicing more and more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">?Returning Old Books?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It Is heart-breaking sometimes to see how books are returned to the Society by those who are leaving the Lord's service or by some class that thinks it Is overstocked with certain literature. Many of these books returned are pecked in almost any kind of weak carton, dumped in higgledy-piggledy, and then the earton is just tied shut, with the expectation that the books will arrive in good order. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">They do not!</span><span class="font6"> The Society cannot give credit to any class or colporteur for books that are received in bad order because of being improperly packed. If you are returning books which were received with the cover upside down, or pages missing, or something like that (which is rarely the case), then, of course, you will he credited for them; but even then they should be returned in good condition, because in many cases they can be repaired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No books should ever be returned to the Society unless you first receive O.K.’d instructions from the Brooklyn office to do so. All colporteurs, when returning books, should ship them back by freight, prepaid, and not by express collect or by mall, as is often done. Always remember that it is the Lord’s money that Is being nsed. Hereafter, please write about your stock and await instruction as to how. when, and where to ship.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Flashtones Help to Place Sets</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The “Flashtone Cartons”, which played a very prominent part in the success of last May's campaign, will be used again this year. Some of the friends do not seem to appreciate the advantage of using those cartons. For the information of such we submit a few figures in this connection. During February, 1929, one out of every 36 placements was a live-book combination. During Marell, one in every 29 placements was a five-book combination; in April, one in every 28; during May, exclusive of IBSA Week, one in every 20; ami during IBSA Week, one in every 15 placements was a five-book combination. This demonstrates that from 65 percent to 100 percent more combinations can be placed when the cartons are used. They have the primary advantage of suggesting to the prospect the idea of a complete set. People will rarely ask or expect to break such a set. The carton makes a most persuasive setting for the set. They look attractive in the bookcase, or on the library table, and can be taken in their entirety to the den or bedroom for reading, whereas when placed without the earton the books become scattered and are not nearly so attractive a proposition. A set such as we have to offer for $2.40, set off in a Flashtone carton, cannot be resisted by many. A limited working consignment for the IBSA Week has been shipped to organized classes. If you find you have not enough, order your additional supplies immediately.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">To accomplish the desired results win mean that each colporteur will be on the job, doing with his might what his hands find to do; that he will have seen to it that he has plenty of territory in which to work, so that it will not be necessary to make a long journey to some other field duriug this week; and that he has looked ahead and stocked up with sufficient books to keep him busy, without running short. Some of you remember your experience during the November drive with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures.</span><span class="font6"> The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font6"> suggested that the pioneers set 14 sets as their quota; but many of you said to yourselves, “I could never place that many sets in a week.” Consequently you ordered only seven or less. As a result, much to your surprise you run short long before the week was over, and it w'as too late to get more sets in time. In spite of this the pioneers actually averaged 6.92 sets apiece during the drive, which is equivalent to the placing of practically every set they had on hand. This is remarkable for an average. Many were the letters received here from ' them saying how sorry they were that they had not ordered more. Therefore, plan ahead; place your order for Flashtones in lots of eight i well in advance, so that you will be sure to have them, and earnestly seek the Lord’s blessing upon your efforts to sing forth his praises. By so doing, we are confident that the spring drive will be a great success and great will be the blessings received and given.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark5"></a>GOD’S VENGEANCE UPON BABYLON</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“Cull together the (weiu-rs ariamsf Babylon: all ye that bend the hoir, tvmp in.iuinxt it nmn-t about: let none thereof escape.”—Jeremiah</span><span class="font0"> 50:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A</span><span class="font0">PART of Hie divine commission given to tiie Christ is stated thus: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“The spirit of the- Lord God is upon me, beernw. the Lord hath anointed me . . . to proclaim .. . . t/ic dan of rcnye.anee of our God. to comfort till that mourn''. (Isaiah 61:1,2} </span><span class="font0">When should this proclamation be made? The gentile peoples having been permitted t'o organize Ilie universal empire of which Sat mi has been and is Hie god. it is reasonable to suppose that the day of Hod’s vengeance would lie reserved until the expiration of the gentile times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Ihe synagogue at Nazareth on a eerlain Sabbath' morning Jesus stood lip and read from the divine commission, as set forth by the i’ropliet Isaiah: and the fata: that lie omilted that part relative Io the vengeance of God strongly proves that the appropriate time for proclaiming such vengeance was not at the beginning, but ul Ihe end of the age. It is imperative that this message of God's vengeance must lie delivered at some time, and that it must lie delivered by the Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The End of All Things Near</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Seven years ha ve passed since the gent de times ended, during which period God's judgment Ims been upon the nations and his vengeance manifested against the wicked systems of Babylon. During those seven years the World War has come and passed, like a mighty windstorm : and the ‘-enrt.il-,quake” is being manifested now in different parts of the earth: and yet. the wicked systems of Babylon, under the leadership of their mimic god, Satan, continue to defame the name of Jehovah, while, millions tire literally starving for want of food and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bread, of Life. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Privileges Only While it is yet Day</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">What shall the people of God do? The duty of such seems plain. Being but a handful, and their means exceedingly limited, they cannot feed Hie peoples of earth with natural food, but they can perform the divinely .given commission. The great Captain of mir salvation, clothed with all power and authority in heaven and in earth (Revelation lt):il-1o). with eyes of naming judgments against Hie unrighteous Babylon. Hie offspring of Satan, goes forth to judge and to make war, and in righteousness smiles the tuitions witli tiie sharp sword which proceeds out'of ills mouth. Both divisions of his army ( in heaven and mi earth i follow where lie leads. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>All Ye That Can</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">Tiie Prophet Jeremiah had a. vision of this wonderful time. As though lie were standing in rhe midst of the people of God. now on earth, he exclaims to them : “'Call together 'ihe archers against Babylon: all ye that bend ihe bow, camp against it round about!'’ Otherwise stated: ‘Assemble for a period al! the. people of God to participate in the great work of the hour!'</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The weapons of one warfare are not carnal, but they are mighty through God to the pulling down of the strongholds of error. Babylon has long been entrenched in her strongholds. She must he pulled down. Our weapon is the sword of the spirit:, the message of truth delivered in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font0"> spirit of ■ the Lord. The attack of the army of the Lord is not from ambush, but openly, and with a shout of victory upon the lips of the truth-bearers.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Nationwide Service Day Sept. 30</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">The hour has arrived for further concerted action. Therefore we call upon every pilgrim brother, every elder of every class throughout the land, and every consecrated brother who cun deliver a public discourse, to make ready and deliver a discourse on Sunday, September 25, 1921, that the people might know of the importance of this hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To this end we ask every eccIosin to cooperate in arranging for such public meetings. One elder should be selected to deliver a discourse in the town or city where Hie class resides, while other elders are sent to suburban towns. Let the message of every •speaker on that occasion be &quot;Millions Now Living Will Never Die&quot;. This message is a challenge ro him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil; and it is also a message of comfort and good cheer to those who have some love for righteousness and Who are yet held in Babylon—those who are really hungry for the Bread of Life. United action in holding these public meetings in all parts of the land will arouse the Interest of the people to prepare them to read.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Jehovah’s Vehicle Declaring Vengeance</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">Again the Lord calling to his people through his prophet at this time says: “Put yourselves In array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows; . . .for tiiis is the time of the Lord’s vengeance”. (Jeremiah 50:14; 51: 6) The message of God’s vengeance is set forth in the books of Ezekiel and Revelation. These hooks have long been shrouded in mystery; but in God’s due time he opened the heavens, that they might be understood. &quot;The Finished Mystery&quot; contains the explan-, ation, written in such phrase that almost any intelligent person can understand. It is a weapon placed in the hands of the people of God. Are you one that ‘bends the bow’? Will you use the instrument provided?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having previously arranged the forward action beginning Friday, September 30, let all those who desire to have a part in the execution of this divine commission go forth with the message.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Restraint Lifted—Demons’Judgment Day</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">Judgment is now upou the demons, because it is the time of God’s Judgment against them, and of his vengeance against all unrighteousness. The booklet “Can the Living Talk with the Dead?&quot; completely exposes demonism; and by placing it in the hands of those who want to know the truth, the Lord's followers will have a. part in this judgment of the demons or fallen angels.— 1 Corinthians 6: 2.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Trouble Preludes Blessings</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">The message “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” is not only a judgment against Satan, the father of lies, and his empire, but it contains a message of good cheer and comfort to those that mourn. It is a message of glad tidings, which must now be preached to all nations as a witness before the final end.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Three Books—78c</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">In this concerted action to begin on the date above mentioned, these three books will be sold as a combination. “The Finished Mystery,” bound in cloth, containing more than 600pages, usually sells for a dollar; “Can the Living Talk with the Dead?&quot; for 25e; and &quot;Millions Now Living Will Never Die” also sells for a quarter. Tn order that this message may go forth to the people, these three books will be sold for a limited time as a combination (not </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">separately</span><span class="font0">) for the sum of 78 cents.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Plan of Attack</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">September 30 will be known as &quot;Service Day”. The activities will he opened September 25 by a public meeting held in as .many small towns in the territory of each class as there are speakers to servo. As far us possible the canvass should be confined to towns which have not previously been reached—territory that has not been canvassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This should be preferably in the towns or localities where the meetings are held on Sunday the 25 th. Each Director should set aside September 30 as the monthly service day for the class, and all of the friends throughout the entire country will then be active during this week.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Equip Yourselves</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">Having procured your allotment of combinations from tire Director, proceed with the house-to-house canvass, selling the three books outright and taking the names and addresses of purchasers. These names and addresses should be handed to the Director so that his card file of the interested in the territory may be kept up to date. It might he well io take with you one of the 55-cent combinations which you have heretofore been selling. Thus you cau contrast the value of the two combinations and this may result in placing the cloth-bound Seventh Volume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have only a limited number of copies of the cloth-bound Seventh Volume on hand, and those allotted to the class are all that can be obtained at the present time at the price quoted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will be necessary to adjust the canvass which appeared in the Bulletin for February 1, for the former title of the booklet “Talking with the Dead&quot; is being changed to “Can the Living Talk with the Dead?&quot; All who have a supply of the booklets with the old title, ■“Talking witii the Dead,” and who desire covers for these booklets should procure them immediately, so that everything will be in readiness to go forth with the message September 30.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Within Reach of Those Seeking</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">Many reports have been received regarding </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font0">advisability of canvassing for the combination instead of canvassing for only the “Millions” booklet. The price of 78 cents for the three books seems to be a great deal cheaper than one book for 25 cents. The times of stress are on the increase throughout the country and the people feel that their small savings are rapidly dwindling. Consequently they hesitate to purchase anything unless it has a real bargin appeal. If you represent: to them that you tire interested in their having the message, they are likely to think, if indeed, they do no so express themselves, that you should show your interest by selling the books at a reduced price or else by giving them away. Thus, by selling the three books at 78 cents you immediately overcome the objection in their minds, for you demonstrate that your interest in their having the message is such that you will almost give the books away, or at least furnish them for the mere cost of putting the message in proper form. This seems to be the concensus 'of opinion among the workers, and is especially the experience of our colporteurs.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Greater Distress More Earnest Seekers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">“The combinations are selling well. People are complaining about hard times; yet there are many that will buy, and many others would like to buy but. they absolutely do not have the money.”—Tex.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Give the Most for the Money</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">“It may be of interest to you to know of a combination offer which has proved successful. My offer is the Seventh Volume in cloth binding, ‘Talking with the Dead’ and .the ‘Millions’ booklet, I took orders for four of these combinations in about two hours’ time, and on another occasion for five combinations in two hours’ time. I find they sell as readily as the Zg combination.”—H.I.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Bettering the Bargain</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">“We have had good success in selling the cloth bound Seventh Volume in the combination, and better success with that than with the Zg . One of the sisters has a number of these Seventh Volumes with the pages cut out and that seems to be a good drawing curd in selling. It has not been the cause of any complaints so far.”—Neb.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Offer a Bargain Too Good to Bass</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">“Of late I have been selling the cloth-bound Seventh Volume and the ‘Millions’, and it is even better than the 55-cent combination in the long run. Even many of the poorer people seem to be glad to get such a nice book as the Seventh Volume, and several have said tiiat the price for the two is certainly very low. One morning in four hours I sold outright five of these combinations, and took orders for three more, selling additionally three </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the ‘Millions’ booklet. This morning in three hours I sold four of the combinations and three ‘Millions’. But whether 1 sell or whether I do not, I praise the Lord for the privilege of going out.”—.V. 1'.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>“Millions” Awakens Interest Volume Develops It</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">“The Lord Inis blessed me in the colporteur work. We find the combination of Volume Seven and the ‘Millions’ booklet works fine. The ‘Millions’ booklet, helps to flinch the order. We find rhe people usually read the. ‘Millions’ booklet first, and that whets their appetite for more. Last Saturday afternoon while finishing up a few delive ties a lady wlm had purchased the books before told me she was passing a house where’two men were standing in the doorway. One was reading out of the ‘Millions’ booklet to the other. She went home, read hers and got n blessing. My 'own heart is overflowing as I have the privilege of bringing these untold blessings to others.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Combination Offer vs. Single Book</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">&quot;I was just wondering if the stock of Zg's was running low. If so would like to know so that I could supply the class with a stock that would permit us to work till our territory has been covered. We find that there are just a few books sold here separate from the combination. It seems to be the testimony of the friends that the best results are had when canvassing for the combination—better than when a single volume or booklet is canvassed for. Some of the workers say they cannot sell any books unless they have the combination. During the last eight or </span><span class="font1">ten </span><span class="font0">days we have worked in a city twenty-two miles from here. Three times we had five to six workers, and we sold 320 books, nearly all of which Were combinations. On our last trip we visited a town thirty-two miles distant. There were nine workers; one -of them did not sell any books; but in spite of that we were able in five and one-half hours to place 162 books. That makes a total of 482 books in four trips.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Okla.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Back Calls Feature of the Witness</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">No doubt as you go forth in canvassing you will have the same experience as is indicated </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">the letters which appear above. There will probably be much joy and enthusiasm in selling the combinations outright, for many people wilt be desirous of Inn ing Hie books. However, w.e emphasize agsiii tiint in our opinion the important phase of me .,-ork is to continue to supply to the interests I tlte message contiil.ued in the STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES, .which will be a omifoti ami solace to them iu the times of greater stress yet before us. Hence be prompt in making back calls on those who have already pur-cliased one -or. the other of the combitui rimis.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Back Call a Year Laie</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">One colporteur recently making back cal’s on some work done over a year ago writes: “We rejoice to see some results from the work that was done here a year ago with the Zg. One lady remarked: ‘I have lived in this place for some time and had many friends, but after I read that book I found that I was a total stranger. They told me I was losing my mind. I have left the church and will never go back. It certainly took that: book to knock me loose.’ Another lady who bought the Zg hist year bought the whole set this year and said that if we had what she thought we had she knew what made us so happy. I wish to say also that G.A. No. 27 has done 100 percent more good than tnany realize. More people have lost their respect for the clergy during the past year tliiin in any other like period of the harvest.&quot; -.Ifo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What a blessing it would have been if the other colporteurs had nurtured this a few weeks after they had made the first canvass !</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Time for Labor Short</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">Evidences of the approach of the dark night are increasing. Seeing these tilings, it behooves each one of ns to put forth our best efforts to work while it is yet called day, for when the night finally settles down no uuiii- -will be able to work. The time is sli'orl.. Action mast be sharp and quick. Wil! you do your part ? Remember the dates, mid prepare for action, and may the Lord’s blessing be your portion ns you go forth on y&lt;uir mission.</span></p>

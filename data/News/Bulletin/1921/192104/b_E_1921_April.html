<p><span class="font3">The distress of nations is increasing. The perplexity of the people deepens each day. The cause is known by few, and the remedy known by a lesser number. Wisdom and understanding are needed by all. Happy is the man who finds wisdom and understanding; and happier still is he who possesses them and gives them out to others, that these also might be made happy. It is the privilege of the Christian to enlighten himself, thereby receiving comfort, and then to comfort those In distress with the comfort with which he himself has been comforted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nations that have stood for centuries have fallen, while other nations are now being shaken to their very foundations. The kings and rulers are watching with amazement the disintegration of organized society. They know not what to do. Perplexity has laid hold upon all, and men’s hearts are failing them for fear because of what they see dally coming upon the earth. Like a great monster, famine, pestilence, revolution, distress, lawlessness, sickness and death are combined In the destruction of the human race. The merchant, the manufacturer, the builder, the financier, the artisan and the laborer, the man with a family and without a job, the man with property and without money—in fact, all classes—are perplexed with the conditions of society and know not which way to turn.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Speak from your vantage point—knowing—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why are these conditions now upon theA'”* nations and peoples of the earth? Is therms M a remedy for such conditions? Can we hope ' i ’ /</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">For the merehandiee of in thereof than fine gold.&quot;—Proverb, 3: 13,14</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">|or something better? Who would not give h large sum of money, much time and effort tjo know the cause and to learn of an effective and certain remedy that would bring yeace, prosperity, happiness and life to the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">J If a member of the family were at death’s &lt;joor, the master of the house would make every possible sacrifice to discover the cause •f the Illness and to find and apply the certain remedy. Would he be willing to go without food for one day? Yes, several days. Jie would be willing to do anything within Ills power to lead to the relief of the suffering one and to restore his own peace of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1 The bread-winner is out of work. The children are hungry. They need clothing; they need shoes. The rent is due, and evic-don Is threatened. Besides this, the children £re restless and they must have some diversion, and a few dimes must be used for the moving pictures or other entertainment The invents see before them these things which oemand their attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the same time there faces them a far greater problem because of distress and perplexity not only in their own minds, but in the mind of every one else; and they ask: </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A i</span><span class="font3"> w6 going to starve to death? Will the r risers of the human race destroy each What does the future hold for us?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>-it Qne Solution</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">CWse are some of the questions asked by distressed and perplexed ones, and they MM <sup>an</sup> answer. Happy is the man that wSthe true answer. The Christian has answer; and it is his privilege,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">as well as his duty, to use his knowledge to bind up the broken-hearted and to make glad those who are sad. He should go quickly and feed the hungry souls upon the satisfying portion—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tell them the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The distress of nations is due to the fact that the world has ended and God’s judgment is upon the nations and kingdoms of earth. Satan’s empire, visible and invisible, is tottering and soon about to fall. He is exercising every possible effort to hold his usurped dominion. “The whole world lies in the wicked one.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“Such as has not been”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The perplexity of mankind is due to the fact that selfishness has gone to seed. The world has ended, and the unrighteous systems of man are under judgment. The great majority of the preachers have departed from the Bible, have been blinded by the adversary; and as blind guides they are leading humanity into the ditch. Satan’s invisible associates, the demons, misrepresent to the living those who have died, inject wrongful thoughts into the minds of the living, and drive many to crime and suicide. The spirit of selfishness, restlessness, anarchy, is largely induced by their influence ■ and the people are ignorant of both the cause and the remedy. All of these things were-' foretold in the Bible by the prophets c * Jehovah centuries ago. Man was warned that just such conditions as we now observe would prevail upon the earth at the end of the world; and man was further admonished at that time to look for the divine remedy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Man’s Extremity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">All human remedies have failed. All fi”--ther human remedies will fail. The conditions will grow worse and worse until the people have reached their wits’ end; ar i then they will call upon the Lord. In t • terrible trouble just ahead the Lord has pre mised to bring through a large portion: an without doubt these will be they who obtai wisdom and understanding and strive, ’• the Lord’s grace, to profit thereby. T1 remedy for the ills of humankind is effe ual and certain. That remedy is set foi in the Bible, the great storehouse of wisd&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Cod promised that at the end of the world he would grant to the searcher for truth an understanding of the prophetic, dark sayings of Scripture. He has kept his promise. The explanation has been given.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Tell others of its value to you</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">This explanation appears in “The Finished Mystery”, in the “Talking with the Dead?” booklet, in the Studies in the Scriptures. The explanation—the cause of the trouble, the divine remedy—is briefly summed up in the little booklet “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”. For the paltry sum of 25c any one may acquire this knowledge and understanding. Is it worth the price of a meal? the price of a gallon of gasoline? the price of a ticket to the moving picture show? Yes; its value cannot be estimated in silver or in gold. “It is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.” It will lift the burden from the sad heart. It will enable the reader to understand the present disturbed conditions and will open the window of hope for the future and let the sunlight of truth so illuminate his mind that his heart will be glad for joy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Knowing value—Talk authoritatively</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Now let each one ask himself: Can I deny myself something for one day to the extent of 55c, and for this small amount acquire a copy of “The Finished Mystery”, “Talking with the Dead?” and the “Millions” booklets? The sober mind considering the question will answer: It Is worth more to me to know the cause of this trouble and what to expect in the near future than the price of any one article that I need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Probably had you gone six months ago, to this man whom you are now canvassing, and offered to sell him food, he would have said: No, we have plenty. Probably he thought then that he must have an automobile for pleasure, even though it now has to be idle because of the scarcity of funds. But these material things such as money can buy do not bring real peace of mind and heart; for one may enjoy them today and tomorrow be bereft of them all. The wise man is he that lays up treasure where rob-fcer.-.- cannot break through and steal, where •;he moth and canker worm do not destroy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Those sorely pressed value wisdom nou</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Had the. nations and peoples of Europe acquired this knowledge a few years ago, they might have saved themselves much trouble and distress. Germany has probahi.v suffered more than any other people of Europe. Her population is sad of heart and pressed on every side. Yet eager to know something that will comfort their hearts, more than 700,000 copies of this littl-: “Millions” booklet were purchased by the-' in two months. Would it not be better to acquire some of this wisdom and understanding before greater trouble comes, that those having it will be better enabled to weather the storm when its fierceness breaks over them? This is the time of great Importance to acquire wisdom and understanding. Ever., man owes it to himself and to his family to arm himself with this information.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Blessings in giving</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">One has but to associate himself with the people to find out how much they desire the message of comfort that you have to give. Present conditions cannot be judged by your past experience in the work; for the demand for the truth is on the Increase, and the onL way you can appreciate this increased demand is to get in touch with the people. The following letter from Ohio is directly to the point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“It seems that the public are talking more about the truth at present than at any time ever known to us at this place. All classes of people are asking about ‘millions now living will never die’. It is an easy thing to get started on this question. Moreover we are not working, and so, you. see, we have time to get around among the pecnie and tell them the truth. There is not midi bread for the body, but we have plenty for the spirit.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>How can they know without being toli;</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The experience of a worker in Texas i -dicates that the people recognize the messag: they have been looking for, yea, longing for</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“One lady, when she saw me approving raised the window and called out, ‘La y, <sup>1 </sup>don’t want anything you have today’. I .-ait ‘But I’ve called to tell you that million: ;c living will never die’. She said, ‘Oh have? Well, come in and tell me about it.’ She subscribed for the GA. Some look at me in astonishment; and others burst into tears and say, ‘I hope so’.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The advantage of return calls</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In fact, the interest is so marked in come instances that colporteurs, upon making the return call, find that the message is all-absorbing. So writes a worker from Virginia:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I continue to enjoy my little part in the work and find that a number of the people are getting awake and enjoying the message that is now due them—‘millions now living will never die’. I called back to see a lady io whom I had delivered the booklet and found that both she and her husband had sat up until two o’clock in the morning reading the booklet. He read while she looked up the Scriptures. I find very little opposi-‘ ion at present and hear such remarks as, I would rather read those books on Sunday ■ han go to church’.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>ill the world—all nations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Yes, it seems as though the Lord has prepared all the world and all nations for this message, much as at the time of his first advent all men were in expectation of him. A worker met a colored man from South Africa; and when he heard of this message he immediately recognized it as . something he had been looking for, but which he did not know just where to find.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A few weeks ago a brother canvassed a colored gentleman on the street for a ‘Millions’ booklet. He bought one and handed the brother a card, asking him to call, as he wanted to get some more of these booklets to send to Africa. The brother called on the .entleman, with the result that he took 50 ‘Millions’ booklets, 25 ABC booklets, 2 sets ■ f Studies in the Scbiptubes and an I. B. S. A. Bible. This colored man is a native African from Seccondee, Gold Coast, West Africa, and is an import and export agent, ’liiis is the first trip away from his home in Africa. He loves the Lord and knows something of the Bible, but lacks the ‘rightly dividing’. However, he now has the keys to us lock and the dear heavenly Father bless to his honor and glory, we pray.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Talk as “one having authority”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In approaching the people with this ihes-sage, talk authoritatively, much as a sister points out In the letter following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Often, after I have made the assertion that millions now living will never die, people look at me and say, ‘Do you really believe this?’ Then, I feel, is the time to give them a straight, confident look and a decidedly conclusive reply. Some say, ‘Oh, well! you are quoting the Old Testament.’ Than I show them that they have not only the Old, but the New, and that both the Father and the Son give their testimony, let alone the apostles and the prophets, and also that the message for this day was purposely placed in both Old and New because some read only the New, some only the Old, and God left no loophole for anyone to say that he did not have the message. These things all help to sell the books. Moreover, I do not paste the loose pages in the G; for when loose, they are an attraction and people often buy because of them. The Postmaster of ................ said: ‘Now I shall read</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">those pages first’. I always call the attention of the people to those pages and tell them why they are loose, and I shall be sorry when all those are gone with the pages cut.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is this personal witness which each one can give that impresses the people; for they know then that you are sincere in dispensing this God-given message of comfort.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Three phases of the gospel</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Encouraging reports, are being received from those engaged in the service selling the combination offer; and by approaching the people and bringing directly to their attention that the book contains something they are now more in need of than food, raiment or shelter, you are rendering them a real service—one which they can appreciate in the fullest degree only in the years to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“In regard to the new drive for the combination offer of three booklets, I want to say that I have tried the new canvass and I feel sure that this will meet with great success. I find that it is just as easy to sell ■ the three booklets as it is to sell the ‘Millions’ • booklet; for when you explain the three , subjects you find that they are usually interested in one of the three, and it is easy to sell to a person when you get them interested first”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ore.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Pass none by</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">' From the experience of another worker it seems as though the “poor in spirit” are also to be found in the Catholic church, and that they too are responsive to the message when it is brought to their attention:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I have been working in a Catholic district and find some of the poor-class Catholics tired and disgusted with their church. The well-to-do are the ones opposed to our jmessage.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">' Another writes: “Three different ones had that staunch Irish Catholic expression on ■their faces so strong that I felt discouraged (when I looked at them, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font3"> inquired if jthey were Catholics or Protestants. They (were offended. One said, ‘Why do you ask? (Don’t you suppose we want to know these (things too?’ Another said, ‘Why do you ask? I’m in for everything good.’ The other said, ‘Why do you make a difference? We fare all trying to go to the same place.’ They all bought the books.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">N. Y.............</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">i</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Items</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">i The following is an interesting note from (one of the workers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">i “The teacher in high school asked a pupil {to give a current event. He said: ‘Millions .now living will never die’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Present financial conditions prevent many from subscribing who may subscribe later. In presenting the ‘Millions’ booklet it seems rto make an Impression to mention that it is a famous lecture which is being given In many of the large cities of this country and ■in foreign countries and that people are so (anxious to hear about it that the largest uditoriums are filled and many turned ■way.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May the Lord continue to bless you in your fforts to get this gospel of the kingdom •eached in all the world as a witness unto <sup>1</sup> nations; for then the end shall come.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of salvation, and call upon the name of the now in the presence of all his people. Precious saints.&quot;Psalm</span><span class="font1"> 116:12-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">D</span><span class="font1">AVID the beloved prophet is here made to speak for the church. Throughout the age his words have been applicable to the church, and particularly so at the end of the age. As the light has increased in brilliancy the members of the body have more clearly seen their obligations and opportunities of doing something in the Lord’s name as his witnesses. We are now at the end of the age. The light is shining with greater brilliancy than ever. Let us take a vision of the present situation, and then answer the question which the prophet puts into our mouths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">St. John was given a vision of the closing scene# of this age. He saw the beast make war with the Lamb. He observed that It is the final conflict. He does not leave us in doubt as to the result. Complete and everlasting victory is with the Lamb of God. For centuries Satan has reproached Jehovah and defamed his holy name. These reproaches fell upon the beloved Jesus, causing him to be despised and rejected of men. The soldiers enlisting to fight under his banner of truth are subjected to similar misrepresentations and defamations. Patiently has Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, abided Jehovah’s due time to take the reins of government,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord in the sight of the Lord is the death of his</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">to destroy the unrighteous empire of Satan, and to supplant it with the glorious and blessed kingdom of righteousness. That hour is come. “He hath taken unto himself his great power and reigns.” The judgment written against the kingdom of. darkness is now being swiftly executed. St John, whose language here we paraphrase, says concerning the vision:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I saw heaven opened.” The great truths of God’s plan long hidden from men are now being opened so that they may be understood. “I beheld a white horse,” representing the revelation of truth; and “he that sat upon the horse”, the great teacher of these truths, is called “Faithful and True”. This is the Son of God. It is the day of God’s vengeance. His judgments written must now be executed. The mighty King of kings has unsheathed his sword “and in righteousness he doth judge and make war”. His wisdom sees that the hour has come for this judgment; therefore he goes forth clothed with all power and authority. Hence ‘upon his head are many crowns’. The world knows not his name, because he has the name which no man can know. Note that his body is covered with a garment or vesture, picturing the members of the body of Christ, who must be faithful even unto death; hence hie vesture is sprinkled with blood—the poured-out life of the body members. Take note that his army is in two divisions; one division invisible to men because in heaven; the other division on earth as witnesses to men, but made to sit in heavenly places because of their relationship to the Lord. “And the armies which are in heaven follow him” as messengers of truth and righteousness. These, by his grace, have on the armor and have learned to use the sword of the spirit.— Ephesians 6:10-18.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Glad with Zeal</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">In this army that follows the King of glory are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">all the saints</span><span class="font1"> of the royal line. The question for me is: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Am I one of themt</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How does the Lord regard those who are his faithful and loyal followers? Through his prophet (Psalm 149: 4) Jehovah answers : “The Lord taketh pleasure in his people. He will beautify the meek with salvation.&quot; These, therefore, must take the cup of salvation. He will honor them, and does honor them. To be honored of the Lord means to be in his glory. What greater honor or glory now could ..any one on earth have than to be a part of the army of the Lord, following after the great Warrior-King, who is establishing a government of righteousness! It is a time of joy for all such; hence the prophet says: “Let the saints be joyful in . glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds [of ease]”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Midian shall Melt (In Your Sight}</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">They are not in creed-beds too short to stretch themselves upon. (Isaiah 28:20) They are not composed of factions that murmur, complain and find fault, stand still and fold their hands; but they have the truth and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">they 7cnow it.</span><span class="font1"> They are not seeking </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">new </span><span class="font1">light, but are walking in the ever increasing light that shines unto the perfect day, according to the precious promise. They are in absolute rest and ease, in faith and confidence in the Lord and his arrangement. “Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand.” They have mt time nor inclination to murmur, but praise the Lord for the opportunity of using the sword of the spirit Thus armed, these faithful ones engage with the King of glory “to execute vengeance upon the nations and punishments upon the people”. They declare God’s vengeance, which is a punishment to all who have not the spirit of the Lord or a desire for righteousness. “To bind their kings [ruling factors—Satan, the god of this world, and his various assisting rulers] with chains [Revelation 20:4], and their nobles [mighty and influential emissaries in the earth] with fetters of iron [strong, hard truths, which cannot be gainsaid and are therefore unbreakable by these nobles]; to execute upon them the judgment written”; 1. e., the judgment against the old heavens (invisible ruling power) and earth (Satan’s visible organization), which are now passing away and which are being supplanted by the new heaven and new earth, wherein will dwell righteousness.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Girded to Battle</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Who are to have a part in this glorious work? And the prophet, answers: “This honor have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">all the saints</span><span class="font1"> Praise ye the Lord” for his goodness in giving all the saints an opportunity to participate. Definitely, then, it Is settled that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">all the saints </span><span class="font1">will participate. • The&quot; Important question for each one to a^k hirjiself is: Who. am I ? Am I a new creature ln<sup>!</sup> Christ Jesus? Am I a soldier of the cross? If I answer yes, then shall I blush to speak his name or hesitate to grasp the sword of the spirit and use it? Shall I quail before my enemies? And the prophet of the Lord causes the saint to answer: ‘No, but I will take the cup of salvation [the experiences that lead to victory], anh I will call upon the name of the Lord [because without him I can do nothing], and I will pay my vows now in the presence of the people’. My vow was and is to be faithful to the Lord even unto death, prompted wholly by love. And to me he has said, ‘If you love me, you will keep my commandments’.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Treading the Winepress</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">One of his commandments is: “Thrust in thy sickle and reap, for the time is come for thee to reap, for the harvest of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the earth is ripe”.</span><span class="font1"> (Revelation 14:15) Other commands are: ‘Declare the day of God’s vengeance; bind 'up the broken-hearted; comfort those that mourn’, by preaching the glad tidings that the world has ended, the King reigns, millions now living will never die! The Lord has armed his saints with the proper weapons with which to perform this duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Is the Lord’s army in the earth split into factions? Should we expect to find one company trying to hinder the&quot; work of the other? Of such the apostle says: “Only let the lives you live be worthy of the gospel of Christ, .... standing fast in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">one spirit </span><span class="font1">and with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">one mind fighting shoulder to shoulder</span><span class="font1"> for the faith of the good news. Never for a moment quail before your antagonists.”—Phllipplans 1: 27, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Strength in Undy</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Order is heaven’s first law. Would we expect the King of glory to be doing his * work in a disorganized or in an orderly way? Do we find that during his presence he created, through his faithful and wise servant, and operated an organized method and effort to do his work? If so, is it reasonable that he would not disorganize this work and permit one branch to do injury to another? Such seems to be quite unreasonable. In St. John’s vision describing this time he says: “And I saw a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">single,</span><span class="font1"> angel standing in the full light of the sun, who cried with a loud voice to all the birds that fly across the sky”. (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font1"> And who is this angel or messenger? We answer: It is all the saints this side the vail, as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">one single</span><span class="font1"> body, the earthly division of the army, pictured by the fearless Elisha. We should remember that Elisha was anointed to do a slaying work. (1 Kings 19:17) The Elisha class must do it now, as followers after the great Warrior-King. Again the Lord pictures this same matter by his prophet Ezekiel as “six men who came from the way of the higher gate which Heth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand”, which six are commissioned to go through the city and smite and to slay utterly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Precious Ointmen Poured Out</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">It follows, then, that the obligations imposed upon the saints are: To slay with the instrument with which the Lord has armed them, viz., the message of truth; to declare his vengeance upon Satan’s invisible and visible empire and all his emissaries; at the same time to judge the demons, and to bind up the broken hearts and to comfort those of the peoples of earth that mourn. This point of the sword is specifically described by the Lord’s prophet (Ezekiel 21: 14,15), Bhd Is/WO believe, “The Finished Mystery”, for the reason that it exposes Satan’s emissaries as nothing else has yet done. This is the time of the judgment of the demons. (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6; 1 Corinthians 6: 2) The Lord has given his people this message in the booklet exposing their methods. The earth is filled with sorrowing people, and their sorrow is ever on the Increase. It is the privilege of the saints of God to bind up these broken hearts and to comfort those that mourn by telling them that the old world is ending, is passing away, that Messiah’s kingdom is here, that he has taken unto himself his great- power to reign, and that millions now living will never die. This instrument (in the form of the combination) or message the Lord has placed in the hands of his people.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>His Reward is with Him</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">St. Paul intimates that there would be a class that would become weary in well doing and that would lag behind; and to such he says: “We should not flag in doing well, for we shall reap at the proper season if we do not relax”. (Galatians 6:9, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font1"> As a soldier of the cross, then, see that we do not relax qt this stage of the battle, but that we press on iir the strength of the Lord. The division of thg Lord’s army which follows him, and which is yet this side the vail, is otherwise pictured as his feet. The Lord’s prophet speaks of their honor thus: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that pub-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">llsheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good; that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!” Should we expect any of this class of saints at this time to be pulling back, fault-finding, muT-muring, criticizing and attempting to . do Injury to the Lord’s work? Are not these the watchmen of the Lord in the earth who are watching and proclaiming the approach of the great Messianic kingdom? Of them the Lord’s prophet says: “Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice to- • gether shall they sing, for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion'’.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The Race is not to the Swift</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">My vow lays upon me the obligation of thus engaging in the service of the Lord, according to the divinely given commission. My opportunity Increases this obligation. Whether I can do little or more, let me do with my might what my hands find to do in the use of the instruments with which the Lord has armed me. It is essential to' as-i semble ourselves together as we see the day approaching. (Hbrews 10: 24, 25) It Is like-wise essential, In the light of all these Scriptures, that each one perform his vow unto the Lord of faithfulness in his army at this critical hour. It is the most wonderful honor ever conferred upon man to be a part of this army now. Hence the prophets of the Lord . describe them as rejoicing with great joy, as they march to battle following the banner upon which is emblazed, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Certain Victory!”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Good Points from Letters</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Some of the workers are taking old tracts with them when they canvass (Kingdom News, etc.,) and when they fail to make a sale they leave a tract to work up the appetite of the one witnessed to and to pave the way for future sales.”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;It seems to be easier to interest men now than before in the booklets, as they are beginning to better appreciate the times. Many are being laid off from work, factories are operating on short time, and many of them are closing down.”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">III.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Sincerity Greatest Asset</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">“One man today scouted the Idea, then asked me if I really believed it, and tried • to stare me out of countenance by a long searching look and reiteration of the question, but ended in taking a Millions booklet.” ■ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">—Ohio.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Jeremiah’s Bone Disease</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">“We are surely rejoicing in the privileges of service here these days! We find ample room here in these five or six counties to which we are assigned and there • Is no inconvenience on account of any lack of ‘elbow room’. Surely if all of the friends had the meagre appreciation which we have of the importance of our message, and the dire need of the poor benighted people for it, and of the responsibility, which the Lord is now reposing in his consecrated people by giving them this blessed ‘balm of Gilead’— surely, I say—there would be a bestirring among the classes, and there would be a lot of ‘can’ts’ speedily changed into ‘I will at least </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">try,</span><span class="font1"> by the Lord’s help’. How any can' keep on reading the Toweb and not get Jeremiah’s bone disease, I cannot see.”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Miss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V '</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“We are meeting with encouragement in the service. The combination is going good, and the ‘Millions’ and Zg are selling especially well.- Abundant opportunity is given for the witness of the incoming.kingdom, and I . find many are interested in the message, even if they do not purchase. They often say: ‘Its the best religion I knpw of—far , , ahead of the churches’. One lady who became <sub>( </sub>interested through The Golden Age ordered the Zg and the ‘Millions’. Another whose in- -terest was awakened through the Golden Age bought ‘The Finished Mystery’. I intend to follow up present calls with Studies, etc., as suggested in the Bulletin. Am thankful for the privilege of enduring some of the . sneers and reproaches, and for the special privilege of helping to clear up some of the false slanders heaped upon our dear Pastor’s ‘ -name. One lady said that she would never , go to one’s enemies to . find out about any cult or religious sect, but that she would investigate for herself.”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Calif. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

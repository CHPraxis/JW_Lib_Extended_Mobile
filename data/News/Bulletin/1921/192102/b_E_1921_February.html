<div>
<p><span class="font6">M</span><span class="font2">ORE than six thousand years ago Sata® began the establishment of his empire. From the beginning it has been anti-God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before tile foundation of the world Jehovah made a plan for the ultimate peopling-of the. earth and the blessing of-those people with a kingdom of righteousness, life everlasting and . happiness without measure. Satan from time' to. time, learning of the development of Jehovah’s plan, lias counterfeited every portion of it— this for the purpose of deceiving mankind. He has, had, and yet maintains, an organization invisible and an organization visible,, the invisible being the old heavens and the visible being the old earth or social order of things in the earth. God purposes to destroy Satan’s empire. visible and invisible. Foreseeing that, St. Peter wrote under inspiration: “The day of . the Lord will come . . . . in which the heavens shall pass away with a great n’oise .... the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up ... . Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for a new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font2"> Peter 3:10,13) This Scripture must have fulfillment.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">the privilege of the followers of Christ Jesus t* be on his Side—the greatest privilege ever granted to any creature on this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;We witness-the passihg away of the mighty , power and influence of Satan and the incoming</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of tile kingdom of Messiah. This passing period will be one of the greatest stress mankind has ever known. We have realized that since 1914 the sufferings of humanity have increased, and the/ still increase. Sorrow and sadness fill file whole earth. Long ago Satan injected his wicked influence into the church nominal, Catholic and Protestant. Therefore we should not expect them to have anything now to comfort the people: nor have they anything. There is literally a famine in Ilie land for spiritual food, and no one to feed the-hungry ones except those Who are on the side of the Lord. The duties and privileges of the Christian, therefore, are many, and amongst them are these:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">First, to declare the day of God’s vengeance upon the unrighteous systems of the universe; ;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Second, to announce the incoming of Messiah’s Kingdom;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Third, by so doing to bind up the broken hearts and to comfort those that mourn.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Greatest Crisis of the Ages</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Satan has operated through the Gentile governments of earth. The Gentile lease of power ended in 1914, and there judgment upon the heavens and earth began, and the heavens and earth are now on fire. We have reached the greatest crisis in all ages. The great conflict is on between the Lord of righteousness on one side and the lord of evil upon the other side. This warfare on behalf of the evil, one is directed against the Lord’s followers, and it becomes</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“ We will serve the Lord”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Do you desire to be one who will take hi® stand firmly upon the siije of the Lord, and b» identified with the Lord when the new order is established, and participate with Jjim in extending the blessings of his kingdom to tfl# groaning creation? Remember that Jesus definitely pointed o.ut through the Revelator, as pertaining to this very time, that the- powers Qf darkness would make war upon hffn and his kingdom (followers) and that those who shoillfl stand with him victorious would be the called, the chosen, and the faithful. Many have been called, and many chosen. The question now remains, Who will be faithful? Faithful means not only to be full of faith, but to prove that faith by our works, by unreservedly declaring ourselves on the side of the Lord. He has graciously provided the . means for us not only to give a mental assent to his side but to take our stand on his side and give the witness for him. While we are thus giving the witness we are preparing ourselves for the glorious kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Taking a retrospective view of the work, we see that since the end of the Gentile times each year has brought forth- some special effort as a witness for the Lord. In 1914 was the Photo-Drama of Creation, a world-wide witness; in 1915 and 1916 came the Pastoral work; in 1917 and 1918 the campaign for “The Finished Mystery”, resulting in 1918 and 1919 in the persecution of the church, witnessing the end of the Elijah work, and in 1919 began the Elisha work; and 1920 was one of the most active years since the beginning of the harvest—the Golden Ack campaign, the Zg campaign, and the opening of the message concerning the end of the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>1921 A Marked Year</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Nineteen Hundred Twenty-One is here, and we are well into it. All the fully consecrated believe that this is one. of the most important years of the harvest, and certainly none has been more important since the end of the Gen-lile times. We may expect the battle to increase in fierceness this year, the forces of darkness warring against the forces of light; and while this is on, mankind is suffering. Now ask yourself: W’hat may I do to prove that I am on the Lord’s side? The Lord has provided the weapons of warfare for his people. “The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds.”—2 Corinthians 10:4.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Strongholds of Error</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">One of the strongholds of Satan’s empire Is his entrenched false and faithless religious systems. He has long caused the people to be taught the doctrines of the divine right of kings nnd the divine right of the clergy; and the clergy have kept the people from the truth and led them into darkness; and the Adversary has shielded them. Now the mask is torn off, and nothing ever published so exposes the nefarious course of this instrument of Satan as does “The. Finished Mystery”. This, then, is one of the weapons of warfare for you to grasp and go forth and use, by the grace of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The warfare against the Christian is not with merely liesh-and-blood enemies; but, according to St. Paul, our enemies are powers and principalities and a host of demons entrenched in heavenly places. (Ephesians 6:12) Through his assistants, the other unseen beings, the demons, the devil has captured some of the brightest minds of modern times, such as Sir Conan Doyle and Dr. Oliver Lodge, and through these has blinded millions of honest people in the earth with the thought that they can communicate with their dead friends. Thus he has perpetuated his lie, “There is no death”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We know that the demons are the ones who are playing this fraud upon the people. The booklet recently issued by the Society, “Talking with the Dead”, gives the strong argument of the proponents themselves and then shows the fraud and fallacy of that argument by the Scriptural proof. There has been no weapon placed in the hands of the Lord’s people recently that is so effective in destroying the influence of these evil ones on the minds of the people as this booklet, “Talking With the Dead”. This delusion of spiritism that has come upon mankind through the forces of the Adversary is one of the greatest delusions of the age; and it is the duty as well as the privilege of every follower of Jesus, every one who is fighting under his banner, to aid in disposing of this stronghold of error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">'The whole creation is groaning and travailing under pain. There are millions of widows and orphans in the earth as a result of the great World War and of the pestilence that followed thereafter. There is great distress amongst the peoples of earth nationally, politically, financially, in a business way, in every way. Millions of hearts are made sad, and they get no comfort from those who claim to be the teachers in nominal Zion. The Lord, in the exercise of his loving kindness, has brought to light just at the proper time the message of comfort; and since he has commissioned the church to bind up the broken-hearted and to comfort those that mourn, clearly then our privilege is marked out. This message is set forth in the other little booklet furnished by the Society, “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A careful examination of Matthew 24:7-14 conclusively shows that this is the message now that must go to the world, to those who desire to have their hearts • comforted. The question was propounded to Jesus, How may we know when we have come to the end of the world? And after giving the answer to that question in the verses preceding the 14th, he reaches a climax in that verse, saying, “And this gospel [this good news] of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then the end shall come”. His words ring in the ears of Christians today, calling them to battle against the forces of darkness that are blinding and making sad the hearts of the people. This is a true message of comfort, one that will bind up their broken hearts, one that will comfort those that mourn.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Weapons Provided</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Before you, then, are the instruments with which to engage in this conflict. Ask yourself solemnly the question: Can I aiford to neglect wielding these instruments now? Is It not my greaiest privilege, as well as my duty, to participate in this work? Do I realize and appreciate the fact that Satan’s empire is in the balance, that God has pronounced his decree </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font2"> destruction against it, that the judgment is written and that this judgment must be executed? Shall I have a part in the execution of it? You will find the answer to that question in the 149th Psalm. Here the Psalmist says: “To execute upon them the judgment written: this honor have all the saints”. Then it necessarily follows if you are one of the saints who will stand victorious with the Lord at the end of this conflict you will participate in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are calling your attention to these facts, not for the purpose of urging you to enter the battle, but that you may see your privilege; and we feel assured that when you do see it you will be like Jeremiah, in whose heart the word of the Lord was “as a burning fire shut up in [his] bones”, urging him on so that he could not refrain from speaking.—Jeremiah 20:9.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Service Essential</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">How</span><span class="font2"> much time each week can you give to this service? If only one day, then that should be used for that purpose. If you can give tw» or three days, so much the better. If all the time, greater is your privilege. Remember that it is just as essential to participate in the service of the Lord as it is to attend a meeting. The Apostle makes it clear that vigilance and activity in the service are essential in the warfare against the forces of the Adversary. (1 Pet. 5: 8, 9) If you were engaged in The Golden Age work, you may have found it difficult to solicit subscriptions; but we are quite certain, in view of the present conditions and the great desire of the people for some message of comfort, that with the combination now arranged— “The Finished Mystery”, “Talking With the Dead”, and “’Millions Now Living Will Never Die”—you will be surprised at the success you will have in putting this message into the hands of the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Canvass</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">The combination offer we recommend is these three booklets for 55 cents. As a canvass we suggest the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Good morning I</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Do you know that millions now living will never</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• die? (holding up the booklet as you say this)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Yes, I mean that you have excellent chances of never using your cemetery lot or hiring an undertaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“This booklet by Judge Rutherford tells why the people now living have such prospects, notwithstanding the fact that people have been dying for years. And why is this so now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“There is special significance in the troubles we are now having. They were foretold long ago by the prophets. The great World War, the famines we all know of. the pestilence—influenza epidemic, the typhus scourge now sweeping Europe-^tlie falling away of the clergy and their union with the financial powers and professional politicians, the establishment of the Jews as a nation—all these happening at this time form real and corroborative proof that millions now living will never die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Many people ridiculed Pastor Russell and the International Bible Students Association’s message spread broadcast since 1881, that the Bible prophesied a world war in 1914. The war came on time. Now their message ‘millions now living will never die’ is being regarded seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“That millions now living will never die is an absolute fact. It is stated in every book of the Bible, by every writer—the prophets, our Lord Jesus and&lt; all of the Apostles (here be leafing over the Scrip-- tural references in the rear of the booklet)—even though it has been entirely overlooked by the modem clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Then comes up the question, If we are never going to die, what about our immortal souls? and especially since our professors now tell us that they are' communicating with the dead. This is a delusion* These men are really communicating with demons. Isn’t it quite a coincidence that spiritism is spreading at the same time that the world is having i* troubles? This book demonstrates that this is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">th* strong</span><span class="font0"> delusion that God would send in the last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“I believe you will agree with me that this subject is of such vital concern as to be worth one evening’s time for investigation (for that is all the time necessary to read it).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“This booklet, “Millions Now Living Will Never Die/ by Judge Rutherford,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“The complete contents of the 600-page hook, ‘The Finished Mystery’, in booklet form, setting forth the &gt;roof in concise and orderly form, unlocking the prophecies of Revelation and Ezekiel,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“And this booklet, ‘Talking with the Dead*, exposing the delusion of communicating with the dead, for 55 cents, not each, but for the three.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tlie procedure will be to concentrate efforts in the sale of tho*e three booklets. If, due to the stress of times, people say they cannot afford 55 cents, then drop to the “Millions” booklet for 25 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Keeping Interest Alive</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the important features of the campaign Is </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font0">see that the interest awakened is kept awake. Bndeavor to have the people to whom you sell the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">books </span><span class="font0">promise that they will read them. Then, by making a second call, take advantage of the interest that has been awakened. Do not wait a month or two, by which time it will probably have died, but &lt;;all the next week if possible. No matter how much people are impressed with your argument or with the good news you bring them, it is soon forgotten unless the mind is refreshed. Each time you have Jo reawaken interest there is just that much time lost. So, then, if you have disposed of the combination offer, we suggest that your second call be with a canvass for the set of Seven Volumes and the Golden Age for one year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In making the second call do not ask people whether they have read the books you have previously sold them, but proceed on the assumption that they have. The canvass below is merely a suggestion, as no eanvess would cover all conditions that might arise. The best canvass will be useless unless the worker himself has, at his command a number of arguments and good talking points for the volumes. Each should be thoroughly familiar with what the books teach and thus assure a proper representation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Canvass</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot;Good morning !</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot;I’m calling upon you because I believe you are one of the millions who will never die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot;Yon hope to be one of them, don’t you? (Wait for the answer).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“There is no doubt but that we are living in a most wonderful time. In the 24th chapter of Matthew our Lord mentioned more than twenty signs by which those living at that particular time could identify it, and do you know we are reading the fulfillment of those signs in onr daily newspapers? (Here mention something pertinent appearing in the .local paper.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“What our Lord taught us to pray for is about to-be established—‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done ♦n earth as it is done in heaven’. You see by the * signs mentioned by Jesus that he is taking unto him-eelf his great power to reign. The fulfillment of these $igns has been looked for since our Lord’s day. Note how accurately Bible prophecies relating to present •times were interpreted. (Here produce Volume 1, refer to page 332, paragraph 1, read to ‘then law fcnd order’). This book, ‘The Divine Plan of the Ages’, was written away back in 1886. These views were set forth then, and some people ridiculed them. The writer got his view of the future from the Bible. You can have the same view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Those millions who are never going to die and who realize that Christ’s kingdom is very near will wisely set their affairs in order. While none Vlll entirely escape the trouble of the present, God’s Word assures us that those who seek, to know his plans and ways will be shielded by him and will probably be among, those who will never die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Have you some loved one ill </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">th* grave? </span><span class="font0">(Get answer) How soon would </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">yon like to Bee your (son </span><span class="font0">daughter, husband, mother, father, etc., alter to suit case) resurrected and have hjm (her) with you? ■ (Get answer) But do you know what part the millions now living who will never die take in the Lord’s work of bringing back the dead? The resurrection of your (son, daughter, father, mother) depends upon your qualifications to instruct (your son, etc.) in the rules of the new order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“STUDIES IN THE SCBIPTURES, a set of seven volumes, over 3,000 pages, by the late Pastor Bussell, all of which were written between 1886 and 1904, with the exception of' his posthumous work, ‘The Finished Mystery’, take up all these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“The reading has been arranged in regular orderly manner, no technical terms have been used, the ‘series written in good, but simple language. This entire set of seven volumes and one year’s subscription to THE GOLDEN AGE for $7.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“May I bring you a set next Thursday? I’ll be delivering in this neighborhood then.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After taking the order then prepare for your delivery by pointing out features that you had not mentioned, so that the person will not have a reaction after you leave and conclude to cancel the order when you are* about to deliver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For instance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“This Scriptural index is a very convenient part of the work. You can look up any Scripture and get its explanation. Then this question feature enables you to take up a systematic study, if you so desire, that'will equal any course in a theological seminary. Our object in choosing this dull paper is that it is restful to the eyes—you know how glossy paper tires the eyes,” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If people do not want to invest $7.00, offer to sell them the set on the installment plan—$2.00 down and a dollar a month thereafter; or, if they do not care to obligate themselves to that extent, sell them a copy of the First Volume. The aim should be, however, to get a set of STUDIES in the home and then, by such means as will be brought to your attention later, keep the live matter that the book and magazine contain continually before them, assisting the the people so that they will go to the books ror a solution of their problems. Help them to read daily events in the light of prophecy. Help them to look behind the news and the events that are reported daily and to see the great Hand that is shaping the blessings for the world in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To those who purchase only a copy of the “Millions” booklet,* <sup>;</sup>the second canvass should be with the object of selling them </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> cloth-bound copy of Volume Seven and “Talking With the Dead” for 95 cehts. If, however, they feel that they cannot afford this, then offer them the balance of the combination, the Zg and the “Talking with the Dead” booklet, - for 35 cents. These should be followed up until a set of. STUDIES is placed in the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The work before us is of much importance, and we believe people do not appreciate what they are turning aside—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font0"> have in mind particularly those • who slam the door in your face. You know what you have; and an effort should be put forth to see that they, too, are blessed with a knowledge of the message. Then those who have not purchased should -be followed up as persistently as those who have purchased, with a view to placing a set of STUDIES In their homes also.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">□.'lie Washington convention is now history; and what history 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah caused his great name to be honored. The shout of acclamation starting from the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses at Washington and reacclaimed from mighty audiences assembled through the British Isles, Europe and the remote parts of the earth, and from millions in their own homes, as they listened to Brother Rutherford deliver his Speech “Government” Sunday afternoon, encircled the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord directed the extensive preparations made for this speech over 100 radio stations in the United States joined in a special private Watch Tower network to carry it. A number of shortwave stations, shortwave radio beam, carried the message to Switzerland, Central America and South America. Africa, the islands of the sea, China, Japan, Siam, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Java. At Buenos Aires, Honolulu and Manila the message was rebroadcast by powerful transmitters at those places, so that virtually the whole globe was blanketed with the message of the Kingdom. Twenty-four different countries have already reported good reception of the speech. Climatic conditions could not have been better. It was ideal weather for radio broadcasting and reception. Brother Rutherford never seemed in better form. The uncompromising conviction with which he delivered the message was undoubtedly, to the enemies of the Lord, a sure sign of their impending destruction. In addition to delivering his splendid speech Brother Rutherford had to work hard to keep the visible audience in the auditorium in restraint. Repeatedly he had to stop them from applauding, so that he could deliver tins important message in the allotted time. From all parts of the earth radiograms, cablegrams and telegrams announced the splendid reception of the message and acclaiming the King and His government of peace and blessing. At Washington the auditorium was crowded out early ; the floor underneath the auditorium, which accommodated thousands more, was filled. Two large parks adjoining the auditorium were then utilized; thousands of chairs were provided, and four sound cars having direct wire connections with the stage of the auditorium were used to amplify the message for those. The audience in and around the auditorium was 22,000 persons. Brother Rutherford’S voice came through clear </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font1">distinct in every part of the auditorium, on the floor downstairs, and in the parks outside. Even the balmy summer breezes seemed to stand still in deference to the momentous occasion. Forty sound trucks were distributed throughout Washington and surrounding cities, one of which was located in the Mall at Washington, between the Washington monument and Lincoln Memorial, where thousands of people are continually passing. The others were placed at strategic points in their respective cities. These picked up the program and rebroadcast the lecture to over 120,000, it is reported by the sound car operators. In cases where the sound car equipment had no radio facilities for bringing in the program an automobile with a radio was provided and the microphone of the sound equipment placed in front of the radio in the automobile, thus picking up and rcbroadcasting it through the sound car. All reports indicate that this arrangement worked very effectively. Honolulu reports a similar arrangement for picking up and rebroadcasting the program throughout the parks of the city by sound equipment and transcription machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The spirit of the Lord was manifest throughout the entire assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses and was most evident on Sunday, June 2, when on that memorable occasion the message “Government” sent forth to the ends of the earth by Brother Rutherford from the Washington Auditorium thrilled the heart of everyone who earnestly desires the Kingdom. Reports after this heart-cheering lecture was given verify the fact that congressmen, cabinet members, ambassadors and all official Washington heard. Because of the fact that this lecture was reproduced in every capital and large city of the world, without doubt it can .be said that the greatest listening audience ever to hear a message heard the testimony that Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ will soon replace all others. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Field Service. The publishers, in accord with the statement in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> that this was to be a service convention and that all the remnant and the Jonadabs should come prepared to participate in the liousc-to-house witness, responded with zeal and joy. There were 8,390 publishers who participated in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">actual house-to-house witnessing. When we consider the hundreds that were required to audit, take care of tlie books, look after the cafeteria, and attend to other details necessary in conducting a convention of this magnitude, it is safe to say that close to 10,000 brethren participated in some part of the convention service regularly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, the field service is what we are here considering particularly, and this 8,390 was the largest number of publishers ever out calling upon the people at any convention. There were 210,196 pieces of literature placed, in 56,050 different homes. Considering this on an average of five persons to a home, the Kingdom message in printed form was made accessible to over a fourth of a million people as the result of this convention; and undoubtedly this participation in the field service by both the remnant and the Jonadabs prepared all who attended to appreciate the marvelous blessing the Lord had in store for them Friday afternoon, when the scriptures bearing upon the “great multitude” were unfolded one after another in a grand, indescribable panoramic view. From that time forth none had' any difficulty in recognizing their place in the Lord’s organization and seeing clearly what was required of them. When Brother Rutherford asked those who believed they were Jonadabs to hold up their hands and indicate it, in some sections of the hall it seemed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font1"> 2, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">column .1)</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>July 27-August 11</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The factory and office will be closed during the period from July 27 to August 11 inclusive, to enable the members of the Bethel family to get away from their regular routine and participate in the field service with their brethren. Because of this no shipments of literature will be made to anyone during that time. Therefore all companies, pioneers, auxiliaries and sharpshooters should cheek over their stock to make sure that they have sufficient literature to last till at least the encl of August. If you need additional literature, send your orders in immediately, so that the Brooklyn office will have sufficient time to handle them before the shipping department shuts down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Please do not write letters to the Society during this period, as there will be no one here to answer them. It is hoped that during the period</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Following the special period, “Testimony for Jehovah and for Gideon,” the same combination used during the period should be used consistently during tlie months of June and July—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah, Universal War</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Favored People,</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of 35c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Due to the depression and other causes, however, many people will be unable to contribute that amount. For those a special combination of three booklets should be available and placed on a contribution of 10c. This booklet combination should he entirely separate from your original offer and should contain two earlier booklets, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis, Intolerance, Dividing the People, Escape to the Kingdom,</span><span class="font1"> or any other booklets on which you are overstocked, and one white (self-covered) booklet, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity-Famine, Truth: Shall It lie Suppressed?</span><span class="font1"> or IFJio </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font1"> These three-booklet combinations should be wrapped up in a separate package and kept out of sight until after the presentation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah, Universal</span><span class="font1"> War and Favored </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">People,</span><span class="font1"> and when the party does not take the larger combination then these three booklets should be presented and a brief verbal testimony given describing them. None of these booklet combinations should contain three coi'.oitED-cover booklets ; always two colored-cover booklets and one white-cover booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This should clear off the surplus booklet accumulation of the various companies and sharpshooters. By the beginning of August your stock of booklets should be fairly well balanced and your surplus stock gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The message contained in these booklets is too Important to be kept on the book shelves; they should lie in the hands of the people. Therefore all the brethren should co-operate and enthusiastically push this campaign and co-opcratc with the director in disposing of such stock as has become an excess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">from July 27 to August 11 the only-mail that will be received will be the regular service reports and the mail which accumulates because of responses to the radio lectures, as well as renewals of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font1"> We hope to be able to give this immediate attention on the reopening of the factory, and such other mail as is urgent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Offer of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Three Clothbound Books on 50c Contribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Period Begins Two Months’ Campaign on Bound Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During December and January last there were more than 300,000 bound books placed by the publishers in the United States. In the month of January alone there were 189,227 bound books distributed, this being the largest number placed, in any one month since 1931. With splendid weather and Jehovah’s witnesses able to get about more easily, it seems that we shall now be able to better this record for book distribution. Beginning with August 1 everyone should be prepared and ready to carry to the people in your territory this special combination of three books on a contribution of 50c. The special period begins Saturday August 3, and, of course, during this time extraordinary efforts will be put forth by all the witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Last winter the large towns and thickly populated areas were offered this special boundbook combination. During the summer months the small towns and country territory which could not be covered last winter should be thoroughly witnessed to during these two months, and such other territory as was not covered. The books are stored throughout the country in sufficiently large quantities to supply all the companies, and there is a good stock ready at Brooklyn and the depots for the filling of your, orders. The brethren everywhere should make a special effort to dispose of their stock, particularly </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font1"> 1 and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font1"> 2, along with one of the other books, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Deliverance, Reconciliation</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span><span class="font1"> In some instances it might be well to make up a combination of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Deliverance</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation.</span><span class="font1"> In other words, take any three that you believe best for the territory you are covering, and have these in the special wrapper, which the Society will furnish. If an individual book is obtained it is to be offered on a 25c contribution, as this “special” is an extraordinary offer during the two months only. If the parties witnessed to cannot afford the three-book combination, drop to three booklets on a contribution of 10c. These three booklets should be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near, Favored People </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World? </span><span class="font1">With this double offer of three </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">^(Continued from page 1, column 8) </span><span class="font1">as though fifty percent of those present did so. The great joy, unity and enthusiasm manifested by those throughout- the remainder of the convention is indescribable; nothing could hold them back from praising Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each day of the convention, of course, had its own particular purpose, and those participating in the different features received a rich blessing; but despite the blessings of Friday and the mighty witness of Sunday with its attendant privileges and blessings, many claim that Monday was the climax of the convention and the best day of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A local paper had agreed to print Brother Rutherford’s lecture in preparation for its distribution locally. The influence of the hierarchy, bound books or three booklets the territory can be thoroughly covered and everyone given an opportunity to obtain some literature that will bring to them the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An order blank is being sent to every organization, pioneer, and auxiliary, so that they may order what is required for this special period. In ordering, keep in mind the success of last winter with the three bound books, and be sure this time to obtain a sufficient quantity. Check over your stock and order such literature as is necessary, and have your order sent in to Brooklyn on or before July 1. This will give us sufficient time to fill the orders and have them to you by August, so that you will be able to start the campaign on time. The companies and sharpshooters who have a storage of the above-mentioned books in stock should use these first, so as to cut down their stock on hand; and in this way they can also reduce their account with the Society. Order all the literature you can use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The books will be charged on your invoice at the regular company, auxiliary and pioneer rates. Please mark at the bottom of the report card the total number of three-book combinations placed. Credit will be given on your account for the difference between the regular rate and the special rate for these two months. To illustrate: During the month a company has placed 125 bound books. Of these, 99 were placed in three-book combinations, or 33 combinations. Mark at the bottom of your card 33 three-book combinations placed. A proper credit will then be given on the account. The same credit will be given this time as last fall. However, no credit will be given unless the number of combinations is marked on the card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Testimony cards and special wrappers are being shipped with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span><span class="font1"> If more of either of these are needed during the two months’ campaign, order them. They will be furnished free. It is hoped that every director, sharpshooter, pioneer and auxiliary will begin planning now the arrangements he wishes to make for this special witness with the bound books. Set aside your territory. Inform your workers. Check up the number of bound books placed last December and January and order a sufficient quantity, unless you have them on hand now, so that you will be able to supply all of the publishers with ample literature for the campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is hoped that 400,000 bound books will be placed during the two months August and September, including “The Unselfish One’s FruitBearers’ Period”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">however, was quickly manifest when the newspaper refused to honor its contract unless the section of the speech relating to “the foreign power with headquarters at Rome” was deleted. This, of course, was refused, and consequently the paper refused to print the lecture. Another newspaper requested and agreed to print the lecture, and accepted a contract. Brother Rutherford had some very interesting remarks to make about these newspapers, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age No. 411</span><span class="font1"> will give you the full story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Accommodations. All the brethren were well taken care of. The cafeteria was splendidly arranged, well managed to feed the thousands who ate there, with good, wholesome food comprising fresh, delicious stews for</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Sound Car Equipment</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Put to Splendid Use at Washington</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah, in equipping his people to render efficient service in the proclamation of the Kingdom message, has in recent years provided the transcription equipment of the transcription machines themselves, and the phonograph with the shorter lectures, and now has brought prominently to the fore the sound car equipment. This latter is a more permanent installation to be used on special sound trucks and installed on passenger cars. The importance and effectiveness of this latter equipment cannot be overemphasized, and the Washington convention has demonstrated to the brethren the effectiveness of sound car equipment. At Washington there were 43 sound machines registered. These were kept busy every day throughout the Washington and Baltimore territory, and it was also this equipment which made it possible for those thousands who were unable to get into the auditorium to receive the benefits of the convention assemblies. The lectures given in the auditorium itself were available through the sound machines to the multitudes assembled in the parks outside the auditorium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is important that the brethren realize the fact that they need sound car equipment for their service and, having this in mind, take the necessary steps to procure the same. The initial cost is not large, .and the equipment may be elaborated according to the financial ability of the companies, the ideal equipment being installation in the sound truck devoted to the continual use of the transcription lectures and kept busy. Each company in all the large cities throughout the country will be able to keep several of these busy as far as their territory possibilities are concerned. Inasmuch as microphone announcements may be made through the sound equipment while the car is in motion, its use is not confined to the running of the transcription lectures themselves at assemblies, but it may be used to announce the lectures, or to announce special radio broadcasts, at divisional campaigns and special lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We shall be glad to hear from all those brethren using the sound equipment, reporting to us the use of the sound machines in the field, the obstacles which they have met and how these have been overcome; and, in fact, all information that may be of aid to others in the use of this important instrument now in the hands of the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">those who wished something hot, and appetizing salads, sandwiches and different kinds of fruit for those who preferred a cold lunch. Coffee, cocoa and milk were there in abundance, as well as an ample supply of ice cream and fruit drinks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rooms. All who attended the convention were well and comfortably housed. The pioneers were especially provided for. An interesting notice appeared in one of the local newspapers during the period of the convention to the effect that the National Rooming Committee was able to schedule only 256 available rooms in the city of Washington and that Jehovah’s witnesses’ committee went out and obtained 10,000 rooms in a very short time. This indicates how far behind the Devil’s organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Order Blanks</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> there is being furnished every company, sharpshooter, pioneer and auxiliary a special order blank, which should be given careful consideration in filling out. On this order blank are six bound books which can be used in the three-book combination. We will fill orders for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> books as long as they last, and this will not be for long, as there are just a few thousand in stock. Companies, especially, should dispose of all their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> books now in storage, in combinations during these months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Due to the fact that the factory and Bethel home will be closed July 27 to August 11, each one should have in mind additional literature that is needed for July as well as for all of August and September. Be sure to order sufficient books and booklets mentioned for this campaign. Combine your orders as much as possible with fellow publishers, so that freight shipments can be made in as many cases as possible. By all. means, have this order blank in at the Brooklyn office before July 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">is when compared with Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Immersion. It was a thrilling picture to behold the 840 of good will who were immersed Saturday afternoon at the Takoma Park pool, but it was learned that these are only a part of those who desire to go on record as standing for the Lord and his kingdom. After Brother Rutherford’s talk Friday, clearly defining the requirements of the Jonadabs, a great many of them saw very clearly that it was their privilege and duty to publicly manifest their consecration to Jehovah by water immersion and went forward and took this step with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneer Camp. The pioneer camp, with its 325 trailers, house-cars, tents, etc., from every state in the Union and practically every province in Canada, was a sight to behold. One could not help comparing it, in its peaceful surroundings under the trees, with the palatial government buildings and dwellings of the enemy’s organization, and thinking of the readjustment that Armageddon will bring about, when they that are low will be exalted and they that are high and dominant now will be abased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers. Over 1500 pioneers from the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America and South America were in attendance, all joyfully singing forth the praises of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sound Cars. Another inspiring sight that the convention had for those who were able to get to it was the sound car terminal, which housed some 43 sound cars with their horns riding gracefully and majestically in the sunlight, every one of them mightier than a battleship for the cause of righteousness and truth. Prior to the speech nearly 10,060 announcements were made with these sound cars, pointing to the big event of the assembly, Sunday, June 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> magazine carries the full account of Monday’s proceedings, and a copy of the lecture, along with other facts that everyone should know. 75,000 copies of this issue were sent to Washington and distributed because the newspapers there failed to carry out their contract. Be sure to get </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> and read it, as well as the special edition carrying full details of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Monday night saw the close of the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in Washington, and on Tuesday trailers, autos, busses and trains carried a joyous throng back to their territories,</span></p>

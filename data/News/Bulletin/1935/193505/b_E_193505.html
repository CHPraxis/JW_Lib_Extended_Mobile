<p><span class="font2">As has been announced on the Calendar, and previously in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> a testimony period with designation carrying the year’s text has been arranged for, during the days June 1 to June 9 inclusive. “Testimony tor Jehovah and fob Gideon” is a most appropriate name, because it is during this time that the new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near,</span><span class="font2"> carrying the picture from the Calendar on Its cover, with another booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Favored People,</span><span class="font2"> and the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font2"> are to be distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Washington convention begins on May 30 and runs into the special period beginning the first of June. Those brethren who are unable to attend the convention will undoubtedly desire to have a part in convention activity, and that will mean that on Thursday and Friday prior to the testimony period they too will want to join in the service work, at least in the morning, when their brethren at Washington will be in the service. The service director should make special arrangements for territory to be covered during these two days with the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 5c.

<p><span class="font2">During The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Period, April 13-21, a united effort was put forth to place the booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Supremacy, His Vengeance </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World? </span><span class="font2">with as many people as possible, and a large portion of the territory assignments of various companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries has been covered with the very important message contained in these three booklets. The question arises, What shall we do next?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On May 30 there begins the concerted effort with the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near,</span><span class="font2"> and from now until then Jehovah’s witnesses should continue to bear to the people the special messages pointing out the supremacy of Jehovah, proclaiming the day of his vengeance upon the enemy organization and pointing the people to the rightful Ruler of the world. That means that in the few remaining weeks before the convention opens, on May 30, all the remaining territory that was not covmony period begins, on June 1, all the brethren will start in with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font2"> book and the two new booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Favored People,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 35c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Order blanks are being sent with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span><span class="font2"> They should be given immediate attention and forwarded to the Brooklyn office so that they can be filled in ample time. Due to the fact that many of the directors will be at the convention at Washington, arrangements should be made with the assistant director or some other one who is remaining at home to take care of the field service arrangements in that territory. During this period every one of the anointed and of the people of good will should put forth every effort to engage in the field service. The publishers should have sufficient territory to permit them to keep busy, and plenty of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is every indication that this will be the greatest year of distribution of the message in printed form, and it behooves all to check their stock and have plenty of each of the publications on hand for the world-wide witness. Prepare now, so that when the time comes everyone will be ready to shout “For Jehovah and for Gideon” and sound the trumpets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ered during The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Period should, as far as possible, be thoroughly gone over with tlie three booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Supremacy, His Vengeance</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font2"> Not only should urban territory in the various assignments be reached with these publications, but as the weather Improves and the rural territory becomes more and more accessible throughout the country a large part, if not all, of the rural districts can be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These three booklets contain the message to be stressed at the present time; and by consistently presenting them to all the people called on in the service from now until the end of May, a tremendous witness will be given. If each one of the Lord’s people will make it a point to have a large personal part in the service with these special publications, it is to be expected that the placement of these booklets will exceed all past records of number of booklets left in the hands of the people during a similar period of time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">There is enclosed with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin a</span><span class="font2"> special order blank to be filled out by the director and stockkeeper or each auxiliary, pioneer or sharpshooter. Order sufficient literature for use during the special testimony period, “Testimony for Jehovah and for Gideon,” June 1-9. Keep in mind that more of the booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near</span><span class="font2"> will be needed than of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Favored People,</span><span class="font2"> because on May 30 and 31 that booklet will be offered alone on a contribution of 5c. These two days, of course, will be reported in your May report and will not be reported in your testimony period report. If besides </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah, Universal War Near</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Favored People</span><span class="font2"> there are any other publications that you need, such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font2"> and other books and booklets, order them also at the same time. Where there are pioneers and auxiliaries in company territory these orders should be sent in together, thus saving considerably on freight charges; in fact, all should try to pool their orders, not only during these periods, but throughout the year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUTH AFRICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The ‘Kingdom Heralds’ Period’ was the best February campaign to date. In the Union we had 66 more publishers in action than a year ago ; 588 additional hours were spent in the field; there were 2,150 more ob-tainers of literature. Over 1,000 bound volumes and about 500 booklets in excess of last year’s figures were placed, the total number of pieces distributed being 9,262, and that number was put out by 234 publishers. There were 32 sound machines in action; 112 meetings were held, and 3,540 people heard the Kingdom message by that means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Information concerning the ‘Thanksgiving Period’ is appreciated, and we have sent out the first letter dealing with that campaign under today’s date. We have set a quota for that special effort of 100,000 booklets for this country!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“An interesting experience with a lady on the Burford Road who took a set of three during the campaign. In passing her home last week she waved to me to stop, and then said she had decided not to read the books, as a gentleman friend had told her it was a book-making concern. She said, ‘I am a seeker for truth.’ I asked permission to give her some lectures by phonograph. Well, I gave four lectures by phonograph, and that was not enough; so I said, ‘Read the books and do </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ried. Especially is this true of pioneers and others witnessing in rural or isolated territory. The placement of bound books and other booklets should continue, but the emphasis is to be given to the combination of these three special booklets on a contribution of 10c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">increase in bound books. The decrease in booklets is to be expected in view of the fact that it was primarily a bound-book period. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font2"> book is going very well, and the Lord's blessing on this publication is very manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention Information</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Field Activities</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Are your arrangements for attending the Washington convention taking definite shape? There is much in the way of preparation that must be taken care of in advance, particularly by directors, sharpshooters and field captains, such as seeing that adequate provisions are made for those who will not be able to attend the convention to have sufficient territory and literature at home, that definite appointments are made for field service, and the advertising of the public talk, which is the chief feature of the convention. Those in charge of local organizations should see that this is very thoroughly taken care of and that all of the folders are thoroughly distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are sending with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font2"> a good supply of information folders for the use of brethren who contemplate attending the convention. These folders contain detailed information regarding the convention, and by obtaining them and giving consideration to the details outlined thereon you will be much better prepared to participate in the convention yourself and to aid other brethren by co-operating in doing your part as suggested in the folder. The directors and sharpshooters, therefore, will see to it that everyone contemplating attending the convention receives a copy of this folder; More copies may be had at the convention when you arrive. Pioneers and auxiliaries will receive theirs direct with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A supply of Washington convention publishers’ registration slips are likewise being sent with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span><span class="font2"> These are for all car groups contemplating attending the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each car driver who expects to attend will please apply to his director or sharpshooter for one of these slips, and either print plainly or typewrite on this slip the full name and address of each publisher in his car. If the car is not full, please mark on the next to the bottom line the number of additional publishers your car will require to fill it, and on the last line mark clearly the days that your car group will be available for service, by putting a cheek mark under each day you will be able to go into the field. Please see to it that all this information is on the card and that it is properly filled out before presenting it at the registration desk, and thus eliminate any confusion and congestion that otherwise might arise there when a number of car drivers are making application at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Reporting</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The literature to be distributed during the convention is as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On Thursday and Friday, May 30 and 31, the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal WaiNear</span><span class="font2"> is to be widely distributed throughout the world, and, of course, at the Washington convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Commencing Saturday, June 1, and throughout the remainder of the convention, the combination to be offered in house-to-house witnessing is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font2"> book and the booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Favored People.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All convention field activity is to be reported to the convention service committee each day, and to your local service director. In the case of pioneers and auxiliaries, their field activity is to be reported to the convention service committee, and to the Society on their regular monthly report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In reporting the activity for</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Be on the Lookout for Another Consignment of Radio Folders</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As soon as the chain broadcast is arranged for June 2, which will carry Brother Rutherford’s lecture from Washington, D.C., a large consignment of radio folders will be sent out to all companies and sharpshooter arrangements. When these are received every effort should be made to put them out before the majority of the brethren leave for the convention. It is essential for these folders to be placed in the hands of the people, announcing the lecture of June 2. These will be shipped in plenty of time fbr this distribution to be made. Pioneers and auxiliaries will not receive a consignment, because many of these may start traveling to the Washington convention long before the convention starts. However, pioneers may help the companies distribute their folders when stopping over in the larger cities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The consignment for foreign and colored company organizations in cities where there is a white English company will be sent to the director of the English company, and he is to notify all publishers in his area of their arrival and supply the allotment to each group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A report of the attendance at the Memorial has always been sent to the Society. This year we desire to have two reports; namely, (1) total number attending the Memorial service, and (2) total number of persons partaking of the Memorial emblems. This report should be entered on the regular monthly report card, in the blank space at the bottom of the card. In other words, immediately under the last printed line on the monthly report card, you will write “1. Total attending Memorial services ________”, and “2. To</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tal partaking of Memorial emblems -......”. By so doing it will not be</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">necessary to send in a separate letter, as the director, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries can mark it on their report. The pioneers or auxiliaries who are associated with a company in partaking of the Memorial will, of course, be included on the company report card, and they should not enter it on their own report card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">'Thursday and Friday, May 30 and 31, to your local service director, sharpshooter, or direct to the Society in the ease of pioneers and auxiliaries, all of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near</span><span class="font2"> booklets placed during these two days are to be included in the May report and are not to be included as part of the “Testimony for Jehovah and for Gideon” period nor in the June report. In other words, all work done during the month of May is to be reported as :i part of the May report. The period of “Testimony for Jehovah and fob Gideon” will begin June 1, and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font2"> book, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Favored People </span><span class="font2">booklets, and, of course, any other literature placed during that period will be reported as work done during the special period, and will also he included in the June report as usual. Please note this point carefully and report accordingly, and thus avoid the necessity of the Society’s having to write you because of improper reports. We recommend a careful REreading of the details contained in the April </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font2"> regarding the service suggestions for the convention.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Universal War Near Favored People</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah in his goodness has furnished the publishers with some new ammunition, and there will shortly be ready for distribution the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near,</span><span class="font2"> which contains Brother Rutherford’s lecture given last January at the Los Angeles Shrine Auditorium. This lecture was broadcast over a chain of 103 stations. In addition to this splendid lecture there is a treatise on “Typical War” and on “Satan’s Army”. Everyone should read this carefully and be acquainted with its contents and then make every effort to place it in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Favored People</span><span class="font2"> is the title of the other booklet by Brother Rutherford. It is a timely blessing from Jehovah by Christ Jesus. With a fitting cover design, the booklet presents a number of short treatises, which briefly but clearly set out who are the ones favored of Jehovah God. The information contained in this booklet greatly aids those of good will to intelligently take a stand on the Lord’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Please note that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal</span><span class="font2"> War </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Near</span><span class="font2"> should not be distributed before May 30, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Favored People </span><span class="font2">not before June 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“The phonograph is doing a good work. Many Roman Catholics ask, ‘Is that the man they are trying to stop broadcasting?’ and they wonder why. In one instance they would not let me open my case, so I asked them if they would like to hear Judge Rutherford’s voice. After hearing the record the man remarked, ‘Is that Judge Rutherford? There is nothing wrong with that’; and he took three bound books.” —Pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“At our r e g u 1 a r transcription meetings we distribute among the audience a number of copies of the booklet from which the lecture is taken, so that they may follow it in the booklet as the record is run. The booklets, of course, are counted before they are passed out, so that they can be collected again at the close of the meeting. We find that many do not want to part with them and are glad to contribute for them, and thus more placements are made, especially after the first meeting, for when they come again they bring 5c with them for the booklet. We invite them to mark any statement that is not clear as the lecture proceeds and have it commented on after the lecture. It has improved our meetings so much I could not help passing on the information.”—Company director, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“All our brethren are with courage to coni inue the battle to the end. Some days ago two sisters were arrested as Communists; but when came the Delegate of Police, he got the books and read some pages of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font2"> booklet, in Portuguese, and told to the soldiers: ‘No, these women are not Communists; they are distributing literature about the gospel’; and addressing the sisters, said: ‘You may go out and continue your service.’ And the sisters came out rejoicing in the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“All of us continue to have good opportunity. The number of the workers is increasing, Jehovah and his King be praised.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Announcements for Broadcasts During April and May</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are a few radio stations carrying these transcription broadcasts that were not signed up at the time the radio folders were printed. 'Therefore it will be necessary for the brethren, in these areas where there are stations carrying these transcription lectures but not shown on the radio folders, to superimprint on the face of the folder (with your regular stamping outfit) the station or stations heard well in your vicinity. This should be done in a neat way and in such a manner that the printing will not obliterate or obscure other stations that can be heard in your area and already appearing on the folder. A list of these stations and time of broadcast follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Ollier brethren feel that because there is no station in their immediate vicinity carrying these lectures they should not distribute the folders that were assigned to them. These folders should be distributed in every area where they have been consigned. There are a number of people who have excellent receiving sets who can get other stations outside of your immediate vicinity. These people are anxious to hear Brother Rutherford’s lectures ; therefore all folders consigned should be distributed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“With honest desire I send to ask please send me Judge Rutherford’s free booklet describing his writings. We have read lots of booklets and tracts, but no one ever gave us such edifying details until we read Judge Rutherford’s books. The last one in my hand is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis.</span><span class="font2"> We live horrible lives down here. Sometimes one cannot find clothing to attend religious worship or schools. We have no government schools, no public schools, so without money the children cannot go to school ; but by studying we get more enlightenment to teach the little ones at home.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I have great pleasure in writing to you and telling you that I have been studying the books by Judge Rutherford for the last six months. I must confess that these books have opened my eyes. ... I have great desire now to be ‘of Judea’ and to give the message of warning to those mj’ brethren who are ‘in Judea’, so that they may ‘flee to the mountains’, as I think I have done. Though I know it is a work of great responsibility, it seems as though God has chosen me and I am ready to obey him when he has called me. I shall therefore be much obliged if you can give me a helping hand &quot;&nbsp;to do this Kingdom proclamation work.”</span></p>

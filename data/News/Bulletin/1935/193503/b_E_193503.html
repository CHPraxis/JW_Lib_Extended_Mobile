<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Anointed s Thanksgiving Period-April 13-21</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Three New Booklets to Be Used</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Have a Transcription Machine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare Now for Campaign Time and Territory Essential</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The next testimony is one of exceptional importance because of its world-wide scope. In every nook and corner of the earth where the publishers of Jehovah reside they will put forth an extraordinary effort during the period of April 13-21 and bear witness to the name and word, of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Reports will be sent in to the Brooklyn office from all parts of the world, and as soon as possible these reports will be tabulated. In order to make this testimony period exceed by far anything that has heretofore been accomplished it will be necessary for the publishers, by the Lord’s grace, to put in more time. If each publisher puts in just an hour or two more than he did during the previous world-wide testimony periods, undoubtedly we shall exceed anything previously reported. Now is the time to make preparations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First of all, keep in mind the ammunition. There will be three new booklets. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Uis Vengeance</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Supremacy,</span><span class="font3"> which have colored covers, tire most attractive. The contents thereof are of vital importance to the people. Then there is a third, self-covered booklet, entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font3"> and containing the lecture which Brother Rutherford delivered at Atlanta, Ga.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The combination to be offered will be three booklets on 10c contribution; and if the one witnessed to cannot afford to take this exceptional offer, then the self-covered booklet ll’/io </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font3"> should be offered on whatever contribution the party can make ; and if nothing can l&gt;e contributed and the party promises to read and study that which is contained therein, then give him the booklet anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At least a million of these combinations should be distributed during these nine days, throughout the entire world, in addition to the many booklets that will be left on just a small contribut ion of a penny or free. The service director should lay out the territory and have ample territory for the brethren to work, not only 2 hours, but </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font3"> or 6, according to the strength of the publisher. It is a good thing to have always in mind to have plenty of territory assigned to each publisher, so that if the publisher wants to witness he can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Special arrangements should be made for the transcription work during this period, also, having in mind public parks, school houses, idle churches, and sect ions of town where groups assemble, and arrange to put. on the lecture “Universal War Near”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The main things to have in mind are these: (1) Select the territory to be worked, and have plenty for all publishers. (2) Order your stock immediately, not only for the nine-day period, but also for the two months that follow, and keep in mind that you should have double the Quantity of booklets W7io </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font3"> (3) Locate places for transcription meetings for this period, with “Universal War Near”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publishers, let us, by the Lord’s grace, make this, The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Period, which is at the Memorial time, the greatest effort put forth by His people to honor Jehovah's name. Prepare Now!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Order Now!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Blanks Furnished for the Literature to Be Used April 13-21</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The enclosed special three-booklet, order blank is to be used at once by all companies, pioneers, auxiliaries and sharpshooters for ordering their supply of the new booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Supremacy, Uis Vengeance</span><span class="font3"> and W7io </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font3"> for use during </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Anointed’s Thanksgiving I’e-</span><span class="font3">Kion. April 13 to 21 inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No consignments of these booklets will be made to anyone; and so that you can have your supply on hand, use the order blank and send your order at once, at the same time ordering </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font3"> and any other literature you need, combining shipments whenever possible to save transportation charges. If more than one wish to have their orders shipped together, all the orders (with complete shipping instructions on each) should be sent to this office in one envelope. These three booklets are not to be presented to the public until the beginning of the testimony period, April 13, and you will need an especially large quantity of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font3"> Be sure to order sufficient for both the 9-day period and the months of April and May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do not wait until March 12 to mail your orders in, and, by all means, do not hold them later than that date if you can possibly avoid doing so, as you will wish to have your stock on hand in plenty of time 'to begin witnessing with this literature on April 13. Send a remittance to cover the order if your account at this office is not in good condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Territory Open for Assignment to Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Territory Reports Somewhat Simplified</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the spring the pioneer’s thoughts turn to territory in outlying sections, which, generally speaking, are less accessible during the winter months. That is one reason why territory assignments here at the office are so many just now. We are glad to here give a list of some of the counties which at present are open for assignment. to pioneers, for the consideration of those brethren who can reach territory in addition to any assignments they may now hold. All who can will wish to come out of the cities and, as pioneers, witness in this more isolated territory. The year shown is the time in which the counties were last witnessed to by pioneers. The witnessing in 1934 was during the first six months of that year. Sharpshooters are witnessing in parts of this isolated territory :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ARKANSAS: 1933: Boone, Cleveland, Marion, Sharp, Stone. 1934: Franklin, Logan, Phillips. Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">COLORADO: 1934: Gilpin, Gunnison, Hinsdale, Saguache, San Miguel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall the Truth Be Suppressed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">March 10 Radio Lecture</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has arranged for a special broadcast, on March 10, of a 30-minute program carrying (by electrical transcription) Brother Rutherford's lecture “Siiat.i, the Truth Be Suppressed?” Everyone should make it his business to listen to this lecture and be acquainted with the important truths set out therein. Additionally, the companies, pioneers and others who may have transcription machines will be furnished discs containing this lecture. “Shall the Truth Be Suppressed?” and at every opportunity a transcription lecture should be put on using this particular speech, so that millions may hear and know the answer to this important question. Radio folders are being prepared, and, as soon as the stations have responded to the contracts offered, this folder will be printed and consigned to companies east of the Mississippi river. In most cases this special broadcast will be on the air at the regular Watchtower period. As soon as you receive the consignment, distribution should begin immediately, and then see to it that, all of the folders tire put out during Friday or Saturday March 8 or 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Now Is the Time to Get and Use One</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the month of March come thoughts of spring: the outdoors, parks, budding trees, all of which have a great attraction to wholesome, healthy creatures, bringing thoughts of new life, hope and peace. Millions of them head for the open spaces, reaching out and longing for something they know not what.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has blessed his publishers with a knowledge of what these people need, the Kingdom, and has equipped us with the means of conveying this knowledge to those heart-hungry ones. How beautifully any of the following subjects will blend with and put real life and hope into this picture: Jehovah is God, The Way of Escape, Kingdom Blessings for the People, King’s Highway, New Heavens and New Earth, World’s Hope—-the Kingdom, Shall Truth Be Suppressed? and scores of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A portable transcription machine among the trees, in the open park, along the highways, or any place where the people congregate, is the answer. Do you have one? If not, the Society will supply you one on short notice. In fact, we have a number ready to ship now. The price of the machine, as previously announced, is $100; with a microphone, $120. For those who cannot afford to put out this amount of money at once the Society has made arrangements to supply the machines on very reasonable time payments. Write the office at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, regarding this. Brother Rutherford’s recordings are supplied free. All publishers, every company and sharpshooter arrangement and groups of Jonadabs should have at least one of these machines to herald forth the message of the Kingdom and call attention to the Lord’s provision for the vindication of his name and the blessing of his creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Booklet</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some of the.brethren do not seem to appreciate the importance of getting this booklet into the hands of the people. Checking up their reports of the activity for the months of December and January shows that they have not placed one-third of their original consignment to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The message this booklet contains is of great importance and should be given the widest publicity possible. Every company should have their consignment disposed of by the first of April. Those having them in stock will push Hie campaign using this booklet and leaving them In every home possible.</span></p>

They are just wonderful, and it is too bad we cannot hear you more than once a week. Anyway, it is better that one time than none at all. Wish everybody could hear your sermons. If all the preachers would talk more from the Bible and explain it clearly, as you do, the old world would be 100 percent better than it is today. May God grant you a long life with good health and strength so that you can deliver many, many thousands more sermons.

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">It has been pointed out in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font3"> that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font3">would be carrying a series of articles on the new calendar.

<p><span class="font3">There are many thousands of letters received -such as the abovequoted in response to the excellent lecture delivered by Brother Rutherford from the Shrine Auditorium at Los Angeles. It is quite interesting Io know that in the two hours following the lecture 850 publishers participated in the field work at the convention at Los Angeles, distributing 1,026 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font3"> books. There was an attendance of 5,000 at the Shrine Auditorium to hear the lecture, and this was very good, con-vertising maps issued free by the larger oil companies show the county boundaries in the various states. This not only is an aid in looking up the location of any counties being considered, but aids in locating the boundaries of any county being witnessed to. Additionally, detailed road maps are often available at county courthouses, surveyor’s office, real estate offices, or other local establishment. The rural delivery maps issued by the Disbursing Clerk, Post Office Department, Washington, D.C., are very complete, cost 50c (money order with order), and are available for most of the counties in the United States. It is very important that a road map or other sure guide be used in the rurals so that no one will be missed, the counties will be thoroughly witnessed to, and the publisher will not stray out of his assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It will not be necessary for pioneers to keep a record of the testimonies given in each assignment for the territory report, and reports on territory may be the same as the monthly reports ; that is, testimonies may be omitted, and the total number of bound books placed may be shown, instead of the number of each kind of book. However, on the territory reports please always show what bound books were used chiefly, and what combinations of bound books, so that we shall have a good idea of the publications generally placed in the territory. The other information is to be given as called for on (he assignment sheets for isolated counties.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ATTENTION!</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers, auxiliaries, Sharpshooters, and service directors are no longer required to send in a separate report card for special periods. The new reporting system recently put into operation requires that special period activities be reported on the SAME report card at the end of the month along with the entire month’s report. The new report cards have been designed so that both of these reports can be made on the same card; namely, the entire month’s report in the upper row of spaces, and the period'activities in the lower row of spaces. This new system begins at once with the February report. Supplies of these new report cards, together with a letter of new “GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS”, have been sent to all pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters, and service directors. Your co-operation in carrying out these field instructions will greatly facilitate the Kingdom service at this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sidering the fact that the lecture was given so early in the morning, 9: 30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. Approximately 2,000 were in attendance at tlie convention held there during that week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To aid the Kingdom publishers in more effectively presenting </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah, Truth,</span><span class="font3"> and two other booklets on a 35c contribution during February and March, the following testimony is recommended. This testimony will not be printed on a testimony card. Those wishing to use it may cut out that portion of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font3">on which it appears and paste it neatly on a card and use it in your celluloid case similarly to those printed on a card.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Quite a few of the companies did not dispose of all of their </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> books during the special period for the three bound books. There are many pioneers who have been using the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> book in combinations and will use some more of these if they can get them. So that we can cleai' out this book entirely, the Society has arranged with companies to remove some of the stock* to the depots and the Brooklyn factory, and if some of the brethren desire to use </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life </span><span class="font3">in their combinations they can order until the stock is exhausted. Companies having a supply which they cannot dispose of in the next several months should report to the Society, so that a record may be had and reshipment made. If pioneers are in your territory and they desire them, arrange to transfer that stock to the pioneers, and the company account will be credited. The reduced rate will NOT apply on these. All books are to be placed on the regular 25c contribution.</span></p>

<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GOOD PERSONS have long wondered why God has permitted so much wickedness on the earth. Why He sent the great plagues upon ancient Egypt, and what relation they have to the people of this day. Why the Lord’s supper celebrates His death instead of His birth. Why God promised to establish a righteous government on earth, and when that promise will be fulfilled. This combination contains the book bearing the name JEHOVAH, and three booklets. The name JEHOVAH means Almighty God’s purpose toward His creatures. This combination will answer all the foregoing questions, and many more, and prove that the answers are correct. The information they contain is of greatest value to you. Why not read them carefully? This is your combination, and your contribution of thirty-five cents will enable the publisher to .put in the hand of some other truth-hungry person this message of comfort and hope.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has brought prominently before liis people the prophecy of Gideon and those associated with him and has shown its fulfillment in this day of Jehovah in which the remnant are privileged to share in the sounding of the trumpet just prior to the battle of the day of God Almighty. In his providence, the text in the minds of the Lord’s people for the entire year is, “For Jehovah and for Gideon,” and it is most appropriate that we should now have the special testimony period bearing this title and that the first part of this period should Include the last three days of the general assembly of the Lord’s people in convention at Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The convention at Washington, D.C., will be the high light of the testimony period “For Jehovah and for Gideon”. Brother Rutherford’s address on “GOVERNMENT” will be the most thrilling feature, to be heard, throughout “Christendom”. There is now in preparation the most important hookup ever arranged on this planet. The United States will be covered from coast to coast with a network of stations, making it possible for everyone who has a hearing ear to listen in. These stations will reach the greater part of the Canadian population as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition; the lecture will be carried by radiotelephone to England, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and South Africa; and by shortwave radio beams to Switzerland, Central America, South America, the Hawaiian and the Philippine Islands, Japan, China, Siam, India, Australia, New Zealand, Java, and isles afar. At Buenos Aires, Honolulu and Manila the lecture will be rebroadcast by powerful local stations. With you we happily share the news just received from the Society’s Strathfield office; that two 10,000-watt shortwave transmitters (both designated Nl'ROM at the cities named in list on page 2, column 1) on the island of Java are engaged for this international network. Those stations are heard in all parts of the earth. The Society’s representative who arranged the contract at the office of the management in Java reports that he was shown heaps of unanswered mail, recently received by the stations from enthusiastic listeners throughout Europe, Asia, Australia; and that “America just flooded the office with letters”. This</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">is emphasized here for two reasons; (1) That every one who reads this and is in position to do so will try to tune in one of these Javanese shortwave stations; and (2) that every one who hears will briefly report immediately to the station in Java and also to radio department of the Society, Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a large auditorium at London there will be a public-address system to convey the lecture to those in attendance. From London the lecture will be carried on telephone lines of the British post office to Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow and Belfast, in all of which cities of the British Isles there will be similar public-address meetings that are being thoroughly advertised at this time. There will also be publicaddress systems at Geneva and Berne, Switzerland; at Paris, France; Brussels, Belgium; Amsterdam, Netherlands; and cities in South Africa and in Australia. Additionally, it is expected that in Australia a network of at least 26 broadcasting stations will participate in serving the people of that continent with this extraordinary message concerning Jehovah’s government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In short, this broadcast will blanket the entire world, making it possible for all people who understand the English language to hear this most important message. What a thrilling event! Every one of the Lord’s people in the United States will want to thoroughly advertise the lecture by means of radio folders that have now been consigned, and also to inform neighbors and friends by word of mouth of this important event. This lecture will be given the second day of the testimony period “For Jehovah and for Gideon” ; and what an occasion for Jehovah's people 1</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>What to Use</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">During the first two flays of the convention, Thursday and Friday, May 30 and 31, the field service will be carried on using the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near,</span><span class="font3"> and this will be joined in not only by the brethren attending the convention, but throughout the field on those two days, the booklet being placed on a contribution of 5c. Immediately following this, beginning on June 1 and running for the period of nine days of June 1-9 Inclusive, including Saturday, Sunday and Monday of the convention and for the remainder of the nine-day period, Is the time set</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">aside as the Testimony fob Jehovah AND FOB GtDEON.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah provides his people with the equipment to carry on his service and opens to them the door of opportunity. During the Testimony fob Jehovah and fob Gideon our equipment is primarily the two new booklets by Brother Rutherford, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wavered People,</span><span class="font3"> in addition to the book Jc-</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hovah,</span><span class="font3"> and these three pieces are to be placed at every opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Presentation of Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The use of the testimony card in presenting the literature to the people, especially during the campaigns in which special publications have been stressed, has been a great advantage to the brethren, enabling them to effectively present the. message to a larger number of people, resulting in greater placements of booklets and also of bound books. To aid in this during the Testimony fob Jehovah and fob Gideon, a testimony card has been prepared (and is enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin') </span><span class="font3">offering the three pieces of literature in combination on a contribu-lion of 35c. It is to be borne in mind that the testimony card is a means to an end; that is, it is provided for the purpose of an effective presentation of the literature and the placing of books and booklets with the people. A casual presentation of the card, by the publisher, however, is not discharging the full responsibility, especially where, for one reason or another, the person called upon declines to read the card. If, upon presentation of the card, the person called upon reads it and takes the literature, that is very good. If the card is not read or a further explanation is found necessary after it is read, it is entirely in order for the publisher to make a few further appropriate remarks in presenting the literature. If the entire combination of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font3"> and the two booklets on a contribution of 35c cannot be taken, an effort should be made to place the two booklets alone on a contribution of 10c, and if this cannot be done, to leave </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near </span><span class="font3">on a. contribution of 5e. In those eases where there is an opportunity for pioneers or others to leave literature in addition to the three &gt;&nbsp;pieces especially emphasized during the campaign, it is in order for this additional literature to be presented and placed with the people.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Convention Information</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It is clearly apparent that Jehovah’s publishers arc impressed with the importance of the coming Washington convention, and wherever possible are arranging to attend. Arrangements are practically completed that will enable the publishers to enjoy a rich season of service and fellowship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Use can be made of any sound ears or trucks or any automobile sound equipment with microphone attachment that would not deprive any publisher of space in the automobile. If you have suitable sound equipment that has microphone attachment, other than the portable transcription machines, and are desirous of bringing this to the convention, please notify Anton Koerber, 1603 Massachusetts Ave. NW., Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Any intending to avail themselves of convention certificates should notify Anton Koerber, immediately. Please do not leave this until the last minute. Remember, one railroad convention certificate will be sufficient for all the members of the family. Do not forget to inquire of your local ticket agent if there are any special excursions on the date on which you intend to leave for Washington. It may be possible to obtain a rate lower than can be secured with the convention certificate. It is possible that group rates apply </span><span class="font2">in </span><span class="font3">your territory. It is advisable to inquire sufficiently far ahead to arrange for these, if obtainable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those expecting to be immersed are requested to provide suitable apparel, preferably a bathing costume and a towel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It will </span><span class="font3">help greatly if you will study carefully the information contained in the convention folder; if you have not already received your copy, inquire of your service director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you come fully prepared to publish the Kingdom message, you will receive a rich blessing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>New Cost Lists</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">There are enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> cost lists for the companies, pioneers and auxiliaries. These cost lists should be kept in a convenient arid safe place, so they can be referred to at any time. The director and stockkeeper particularly, as well as pioneers and auxiliaries, should check over the list carefully and order such literature as your territory requires in the various lan-j guages. This cost list replaces all previous cost lists, and your old one should be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention Folder Consignment </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Be Sure to Distribute All of Them</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the first week in May over five and one-half million radio folders announcing Brother Rutherford’s world-wide broadcast from the Washington convention Sunday June 2 were consigned to the companies and sharpshooters. Pioneers and auxiliaries, therefore, are requested to assist the companies or sharpshooters in their locality in this distribution. Upon receipt of their consignments service directors and sharpshooter's should arrange immediately to place these in the hands of the people, so that all the folders will have been distributed before the brethren leave for the convention. Additional stations are still being contracted for in this special network. In areas where these additional stations are, the service directors and sharpshooters should see that neighboring service organizations are also informed of the additional stations and see that the call letters and frequency of these stations are cross-printed (use your local stamping outfit) on the radio announcements. This convention chain broadcast should receive as wide publicity as possible. Below is a list of some of the additional stations just contracted for.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Counting Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publishers should count and report only the number of hours in actual house-to-house witnessing. Time going to and from territory should not be counted nor reported. Count the time from your first call to the making of your last call. Count the time spent with the phonograph when using it from house to house with the literature, but not when making back calls. Time spent solely in driving car, transcription activities, or distributing radio announcements should not be counted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren responsible tor giving the Society a report of the local Memorial gathering and celebration are requested to be sure that they have made such report to this office. The report should consist of the following: 1. The total number attending the Memorial service. 2. The total number partaking of the Memorial emblems. These reports were to be included on the regular monthly report cards which are now duo at the Brooklyn office. If you have not made such a report, send it in immediately, please.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 3) </span><span class="font3">shooter groups during this period, ample provision should be made for all the individual publishers to have on hand a good supply of literature, and sufficient assignment of territory to keep them busy during the entire period, and in those cases where sharpshooters or service directors will be attending the convention in Washington someone should be left in charge of the service in the home territory so that the witness can go right ahead in the absence of the service director. There being two new booklets in use during the period, the most thickly settled territory can well be gone over, including that in which the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah </span><span class="font3">book may have previously been pre-only fair to state that they include only the house-to-house witnessing as far as the time shown devoted to the service is concerned. Time spent exclusively in putting on transcription meetings with sound equipment is not included, even though the number of machines, meetings and attendance are, shown. In addition to this there was a tremendous amount of time and effort spent in the petition work during the winter months of this year and of last, which does not show on either report. When all these things are considered, the very splendid increase shown for 1935 is a clear indication that the Lord has richly blessed the efforts of the anointed and their associates who were permitted to have some part in this service. This should cause each one to be deeply grateful to Jehovah for the privileges now accorded us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Very Necessary Instrument</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bach unit of publishers needs some form of the sound equipment, either the phonograph, the, transcription machine, or installation for sound cars. The phonograph can be obtained at $14. There is now being made by the Society a new model which is a few pounds lighter and more attractive, being covered with brown cloth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is a larger equipment, the transcription machines, which now can be used for the 78- and Ihe 33V r.p.m. discs. We have just recently been able to get such a motor, and therefore the new machines which are now being made are equipped for both speeds. ’The transcription machines operate from a 6-volt battery, having a 4-watt output amplifier, and can be obtained for $100; with microphone attachment, $120. Delivery immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The large equipment which can be mounted on sedan ears can be usqd to give a splendid witness outdoors. There are two of these equipments: one with a 15-watt amplifier, the other with a 20-watt amplifier. The 15-watt equipment and horns for mounting on the roof of- your ear can be had for $140, and the 20-watt equipment for $175. The publishers who do not have this equipment should earnestly consider bow to obtain some sound equipment for their service work. Those tv ho have one or more equipments and can put to use additional sound apparatus should further consider the extension of this field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sented, in order to reach as many people as possible (luring ihe nine days. If, in order to give proper attention to the rural territory during the summer months (when it is accessible), it is found necessary to devote a portion of this period to witnessing in the rurals, the most thickly settled portion should be</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">New Transcription Folders</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As has already been announced, there is being carried on throughout tlie United States and other countries a special series which opens with “Universal War Near”, fol-■ lowed the next week with “Shall 'Truth Be Suppressed?” zkfter the half-hour lecture on &quot;Shall Truth Be Suppressed?” a study should begin on the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near. </span><span class="font3">Then for the next five weeks these lectures are to be given:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Who Shall Rule the World?” “Knowledge and Understanding” &quot;Desolating Abominations” “Famine”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Prating tor Prosperity”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Folder No. 1 advertises the first two lectures, “Universal War Near” and “Shall Truth Be Suppressed?” giving space on one side for the place and time of meeting. The second folder carries announcement of the remaining five lectures. These should be used regularly in putting on transcription meetings, and both of the folders should be given out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When a territory is selected for a new transcription meeting, cover the territory with the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah </span><span class="font3">and three booklets, including one of the self-covered booklets, on a contribution of 35c, and leave with each individual the No? 1 folder. Two weeks later cover the same territory with three different booklets (including, of course, one of the selfcovered booklets) on a 10c contribution, or, if believed advisable, with just one booklet on contribution of 5c, and leave folder No. 2 at every home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Splendid results have been obtained in different parts of the United States using- this method. Also, there have been located many people of good will who are now associated with Jehovah’s witnesses and taking a very active part in the witness work as publishers of the Kingdom. It is further suggested that in covering this territory special note should be made of those showing a little Interest, and back calls should be made with the phonograph and personal invitations given to attend the regular transcription meetings. In this way your transcription meetings can be built up, and very likely an interesting study arranged for thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Report May’s Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On Thursday and Friday May 30 and 31 the field service will be carried on witli tlie booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near.</span><span class="font3"> This will be used not only by the brethren participating in the witness at the Washington convention, but also by those who arc serving in their own home territory. The booklets that are placed during these two days are to be included in the monthly reports for May, and are not to be included in the report for the special testimony period, which period begins June 1. A special, separate report of the activities of these two days will not be necessary, but the report for the entire month of May is to include all the field service from May 1 to 3.1, including the concentrated witness with the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">chosen. An effort must be made to overcome ns far as possible the loss of time which will be encountered by those returning from the convention following June 3, and it would be entirely in order for tlie brethren to arrange to witness in conjunction with any of the companies with whom they are in contact en route to their home territory in order to get in as much time as possible during the testimony period. Confidently trust in Jehovah and fight on tlie side of his Vindicator, the Greater Gideon, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

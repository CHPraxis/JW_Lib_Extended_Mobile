<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Directors Should Aid the Publishers in Every Detail </span><span class="font1">“JEHOVAH’S BATTLE.” How appropriate that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font1">should start I he year 1935 with the foregoing title and that the first special period of 1935, Kingdom Heralds’ Testimony Period, should be with the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font1"> dedicated to The Unselfish One! This setting alone is thrilling beyond words and spurs to action his anointed and all people of good will as nothing else could.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As we prepare to go forward during this special testimony period, placing the name and purposes of Jehovah before the people of good will and bringing the issue more decisively to the attention of the rulers, what could be more appropriate than to again give consideration to the message the Lord brings to us through the January 1 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower? </span><span class="font1">The first paragraph is here quoted because it bears so pointedly on the work of this period, but each one should reread the article a number of times to get the issue very clearly in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“JEHOVAH engages in battle for his name’s sake. The battle that will completely vindicate his name will be the ‘battle of that great day of God Almighty’, fought at the place which he has chosen, and hence is called the ‘battle of Armageddon’. He assembles his own forces and maneuvers the enemy to come up against them for battle. The ‘King of eternity’, whose name alone is Jehovah, has made Christ Jesus his Chief Officer and Vindicator or Executioner of judgment and has sent him forth to engage the enemy in battle for the purpose of vindicating his great and holy name. The time lias come for Jehovah by his strong ‘right arm’, Christ Jesus, to take possession of the earth, and relating to that time he caused his prophet in centuries past to write: ‘To Jehovah belongeth the earth, and the fulness thereof.’ Then the prophet propounds the question : Who shall be in his holy organization and witness the triumph of the King? Jehovah causes the answer to be written: ‘The clean of hands, and the pure of heart .. . shall bear away the blessings from Jehovah and vindication from his delivering God.’ The time of the fulfilment of these prophetic utterances is after Jehovah has enthroned his beloved Son and sent him to the temple for judgment. Jehovah, the King of Eternity, causes announcement to be made at the temple, to wit, ‘Lift up, ye gates, your heads, and lift yourselves up, ye ancient doors, that the king of glory may come in. Who, then, is the king of glory? Jehovah (God) of hosts, he is the king of Glory.’—Ps. 24, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roth. Pss.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As suggested in the January </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font1"> urban territory should be worked during this testimony period, 'this is wise for several reasons: first, because in thickly populated areas a greater and wider witness can be given to the name and purposes of Jehovah in a short time; second, this type of territory is more accessible in the wintertime; and, third, it offers more protection from inclement weather, enabling the publishers to devote more time to the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each director ami service committee is responsible for seeing to it that complete preparations are made for territory, literature and other details. Let no one be found running around at the last minute not knowing what to do, where to go, or When. Let each publisher arrange now for territory, witnessing party, stock of literature, and any other details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We may be assured as we go forward bearing the name of Jehovah before all in this very significant manner that the hosts of Jehovah are going forward doing their part in the battle which will ultimately result in Satan and his hordes of wickedness biting the dust. Blessed indeed is our lot that we can see opr great privilege and take advantage of it at this time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">JEHOVAH,</span><span class="font1"> the new book written by Brother Rutherford, which the brethren have now had an opportunity to study, is to be presented to the people in the field service lor the first time during Kingdom Heralds’ Testimony Period, February 2-10. So that you may have this on hand and be able to participate with others of the Lord’s people in the distribution of this important publication, you must order your supply from the Society. None of these books will be sent without order. While every mail brings many orders for the book, it still appears that quite a few companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and others are putting off sending their orders for their stock of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font1"> until the last minute. If you have not arranged for your supply of this book, do so at once, and avoid a possible disappointment because of not getting it in time to start out with the proper ammunition on February 2.

<p><span class="font1">January 13 witnessed one of the most remarkable demonstrations of Jehovah’s favor ever experienced by his people. After repeated attempts by Satan to thwart the efforts of Jehovah’s witnesses, one of the most effective networks of stations yet assembled broadcast to the far-flung corners of the earth the speech by Brother Rutherford, “Universal War Near.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How certain was the sound of the trumpet! What a clear-toned call to push the battle to the gates! “For Jehovah and for Gideon.” Who could possibly hesitate after seeing the sword of the Lord so powerfully wielded! Certainly no creature of good will; only the selfish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reports from everywhere state that a mighty shout went up throughout the earth in unison with the assembly in Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One hundred and two of the world’s most up-to-date and efficient radio stations joined in a mighty symphony sending forth the tones of the Song of Battle encircling the world with the speed of light.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">To aid the publishers in placing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font1"> Brother Rutherford has prepared the testimony, which is printed on a card, and enclosed with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span><span class="font1"> You have studied the contents of the new book, and know that it is of greatest interest and importance to good persons. Jehovah’s witnesses, appreciating the revelation of the King of Eternity, his name, his covenants and his Vindicator, will be enthusiastic in their presentation of the message to the people, basing their presentation on the testimony provided. In his Word Jehovah discloses why all persons who get life everlasting must love, joyfully obey, and serve him. It is our happy privilege to have a part in publishing these truths of Jehovah to the people, enabling them to know of Jehovah’s Word, ‘that they may live.’ At this opportune time we are provided with a beautiful new book with its wonderful message. Let us faithfully do our part to the honor of Jehovah,</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Transcription Machines Doing Splendid Work</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Orders Can Be Filled Immediately</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">These Are the Regular PTM’s Made by the Society</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The monthly report of the transcription machines continues to go ahead. Thousands of persons are learning of the truth through this means. Brother Rutherford’s lectures are being appreciated by many, and the response to the lectures is gratifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society has transcription machines on hand now and can fdl orders immediately. For some time the demand for transcription machines was so great that we could not keep up with the orders; but we are pleased to announce that all orders are now filled, and if anyone wants a transcription machine he can place an order and immediate delivery will be made. The transcription machines are $100 each; with microphone attachment, $120. There are arrangements whereby companies or individuals can obtain these machines on a small down payment and send in the balance wionth by month as their means permit. We hope that the brethren will take advantage of these machines and put them to use. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For your encouragement we set out below a few items of interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Our company has hit upon a method of handling our PTM work which has greatly Increased its effectiveness and the attendance as well. Before June 1, when we inaugurated the new method, we were more or less discouraged with the results of our efforts with the PTM work, because it was so difficult to get suitable places to hold the lectures where the public would attend. Now we are using trailer similar to those used by pioneers, in which we store and move from place to place</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Testimony for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Angels</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Booklet</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some of t he brethren write and tell us they are having difficulty In using the testimony suggested for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Angels</span><span class="font1"> booklet, that is, having the people read the “Foreword”. Others write us that they have typewritten this “Foreword” upon a card and use it as a testimony with good effect. We believe this latter suggestion is a good one. All one needs to do is to copy the “Foreword” on a card and add the following (without the quotation ’marks, of course) : “You will enjoy it very much. You may contribute five cents to aid in a wider distribution of this very helpful message.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We believe this will greatly aid the publishers in placing the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ant/els </span><span class="font1">booklet with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Leaders</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As has been the custom, the Society will supply service leaders for companies within an area of 200 miles from Brooklyn to cooperate with the brethren in the field service during the first and the last week-end of this special period, with the understanding that the local brethren, as far as possible, arc going to cooperate with them in the witness work Saturday afternoon and Sunday. The service leaders will not be able to leave Bethel until after noon on Saturday, due to the fact that they will be working during the forenoon. Please make your request as soon as possible, in order that all arrangements for this campaign may be completed at an early date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">all our equipment, consisting of P.T. Machine, folding chairs and camp stools, books, booklets, and advertising matter, and also two lanterns ; one a gasoline pressure lantern which we hang near the trailer to throw a strong light on display of Kingdom literature, etc. We hold the meetings in the open air on any suitable vacant space where we can get permission to park trailer. The people will attend an open air meeting in the semi-darkness much more readily than they will enter a building of any description.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Recently a friend of mine committed suicide as a result of worry over financial losses. As he was not a member of any church and had taken his own life, the widow and family were in a quandary what to do. We offered the transcription service to the undertaker and the family, which they gladly accepted. The service was held in the funeral parlor, the ‘speaker’ was placed back of the casket and concealed by Howers, a soft organ selection was first played and then the record J-78 (‘Funerals’) was given, followed by a prayer by a J. w. Twenty-seven were present (twenty-two w ere strangers), and all were loud in their praise of the service. The undertaker stated that it was the most sensible service that he had ever heard or witnessed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Recently I had charge of a weekly circuit of nine (transcription) meetings. Six out of the nine developed study groups, and now, by consolidating, we have three regular studies, one a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">study with 35 attending, the majority Jonadabs. Would like to have a full set of i8 phonograph records. We have all kinds of questions to deal with when we get a bunch together with so many different lines of thought.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">All Bound Books Now on 25c Contribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The special period of two months set aside for the distribution of bound books has proved a real blessing to J e li o v a h’s witnesses. Thousands of persons have availed themselves of these three splendid books and have taken advantage of the special offer. Now that this period has ended, each one of the publishers should make it his business to offer the bound books on a contribution of 25c. After January no one should make any special offers, as it will cause confusion amongst the Lord’s people. The special wrappers which were furnished, if not used, should be destroyed, as well as the testimony card. We hope that all directors and pioneers will give this attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Your February Report!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember that it is with your report for witnessing during February that you begin to report in the new way. Show on the report cards to this office the following information :</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Three Booklets to Be the Offer</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Having presented a special combination of bound books for two months during December and January, and having made a concerted effort with the bound book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah </span><span class="font1">during the testimony period of February 2-10, the publishers throughout the field will desire to continue to place with the people the Kingdom message in boundbook form. This they should certainly do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During February and March, do not drop down to a presentation of booklets only. Instead, following the testimony period ending February 10, the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font1"> should be used throughout these months, in conjunction with the other books and booklets, and it should be left with every person possible. In those cases where combinations of several books cannot be placed, the eoin-</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Thursday Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 7 Should Be All-Day Service for Many</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the December 1 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> notice was carried of the fact that the Bethel home, factory and office would be closed during 'Thursday of the special service period in December to enable the Bethel family to cooperate one full day in the middle of the week with the other brethren in the field service. This arrangement was found very profitable and enabled brethren Io give a splendid witness among the people during this day in the middle of the week. In most places people were at home and in a frame of mind to listen to the testimony, much more so than on Saturday, when so many people are busy going down town or making preparations for the week-end. A number of the brethren and companies throughout the country have written to the effect that they have made similar arrangements, and found it very advantageous. This method is strongly recommended to all the companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let Thursday, in midweek, be a regular witnessing day, and particularly during these* special testimony periods arrangements should be made, as far as possible, for the brethren who can do so to get some time off from their secular employment to enable them to have a part in the service. Many of the sisters can so arrange. The Bethel family are making arrangements to go forth in the field service all day Thursday, February 7. For that reason the office and factory will be closed, and no mail opened or orders shipped, during that day. Each one, therefore, should plan accordingly.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Ordered a Good Supply of “JEHOVAH” for Kingdom Heralds’ Testimony Period February 2-10 ? ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">bination to be especially stressed is that of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font1"> together with any two of the regular booklets and, in addition, the special booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Truth, Shall It Be Suppressed?—</span><span class="font1">all on a contribution of 35c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This will make an excellent offer, and its consistent presentation will maintain the high average of booklets placed, as well as of books. The testimony with which the publishers are being supplied to be used during the campaign with the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah </span><span class="font1">may be used with this combination, the publishers stating that in addition to the book they are making the offer of the additional three booklets, all on a contribution of 35e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The territory that was not witnessed to with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font1"> book during the testimony period can be readied with this publication during the next two months, and all company and sharpshooter assignments, and other territory as far as possible, should be thoroughly gone over with this book.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Have Any </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Left?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Any companies that find they have a quantity of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> books in storage after the special campaign with the three books, and do not feel they can dispose of them within a reasonable time after this period on the regular 25c contribution, may write the service department, stating the quantity on hand, and we will see what can be. done toward placing them with other publishers who may be able to use them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Should Be Reported</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font1"> booklet placements should be counted and reported by the publishers the same as any other booklet. Companies, sharpshooters, pioneers, auxiliaries, and Jonadabs should report their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font1"> booklet placements together with their other booklet placements in the column marked “Total booklets placed”. It is not necessary to report on the monthly report card a separate item of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font1"> booklet placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column I/) </span><span class="font1">the continuance, of this wonderful message of the Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tkueo, N. S., Canada. “We heard Judge Rutherford over short-wave W2XAD. Every word came in distinctly and with force. Surely all listening must have been convinced of the sincerity of the speaker.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sybacuse, N. Y. “Kindly send me the speech ‘Univebsal Wai’ broadcast by Judge Rutherford from California. I think it is the best broadcast I have ever heard, and I hope he will continue to the end by the help of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Norfolk, Va. “Oh yes; I heard it, and it was the greatest ever. I would like to have ten copies of it, for which I enclose 50c. It was the most complete, conclusive proof I have ever heard, and Judge Rutherford’s voice was as clear and posi-live at the close as it was in the beginning, although he must have been very tired. It takes a man of God to deliver God’s message.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Quincy, III. “Got home from church this morning in time to hear part of your sermon, and can say it sure was interesting, and so I’m sending for it as you announced. Am enclosing the 5e. Hope they will put more of God’s niessaj^ over the radio, as I gel more enjoyment out of them than anything else I hear. May God bless you in your work is my earnest prayer.”</span></p>

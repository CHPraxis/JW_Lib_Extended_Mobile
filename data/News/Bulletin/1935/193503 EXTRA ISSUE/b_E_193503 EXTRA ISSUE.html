<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What an Assortment for This Thanksgiving Period I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Booklets Prepared in All Languages</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The witness during The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Pebiod, April 13-21, is to be with the three new booklets, in the English language, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">His Vengeance, Supremacy,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World ?</span><span class="font2"> Of course, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">His Vengeance</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Supremacy</span><span class="font2"> being available only in English, there will be some brethren who are foreign-speaking and witnessing in strictly foreign-language territory who will not be able to use them to advantage but will need to place literature in foreign languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the testimony period these who are witnessing in strictly foreign-language territory should concentrate their efforts on a combination of three booklets placed on a contribution of 10c, these three booklets to be any two in foreign languages and, in addition, the new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World? </span><span class="font2">in English (or in your language if so published by April 13). This will make an excellent offer, as the two foreign booklets are ordinarily placed on a contribution of 10c, and, in addition, the special message in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font2"> is to be placed with every combination. It has been the experience of all the publishers that while in many homes the people spoken to may not be able to read English as well as some other language, yet in practically all the families there are members who can read the English language, and the message in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font2"> certainly must reach them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This means that foreign-speaking companies, pioneers, auxiliaries and sharpshooters as well as English brethren will need to order a good supply of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font2"> in addition to any booklets In foreign languages that they will require, so as to have ample stock on hand to last all during the period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font2"> is now ready in English, Spanish, Arabic, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, and, it is hoped, will be ready in other languages soon. But be sure to order a good supply of English booklets in addition to this booklet in your ’ language.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Nine Days of Intensive Witnessing with Three New Booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Millions Are Now Ready for Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s marked blessing has been upon the special world-wide service periods, and they have become a source of great joy to Jehovah’s publishers everywhere. There is unity of vision, proclamation and action from one end of the globe to the other on these occasions. All of the anointed, Jonadabs, and other people of good will who can possibly do so should have their part in this onward march of the great army of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brother Rutherford has again given us a very clear and cogent presentation of the issue and our great privilege of having a part in this witness, in his letter accompanying this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> as well as a splendid testimony. After reading the letter and the testimony each one will appreciate how the Lord has adequately provided us with equipment to represent Him intelligently and effectively during this period. The letter and testimony will be printed in every language in which the Kingdom message is available, and sent to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscribers throughout the world, so that no matter where Jehovah’s publishers dwell, whether in the great metropolitan centers of the world or in some remote sections of Alaska, Africa or the isles of the sea, provisions are made for their having a part in this great witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Months have been spent in the preparation for The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Pebiod. Thousands of booklets are coming from the presses hourly and are being shipped to every corner of the earth where publishers reside, so that this one particular message can be distributed at a given time. Translators have been working day and night preparing the translations of the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font2"> Linotypes are turning out line after line just as fast as possible, so that in Europe, Asia, Africa, America and the isles of the sea this booklet will be ready in numerous languages. Millions of copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">His Vengeance, Supremacy, </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font2"> are now in storage at different points, ready for distribution throughout the earth when the set time arrives. Shipments continue to go forward so that everything will be in readiness In plenty of time before April 13.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">In short, the Society is doing everything possible to make this the greatest united witness yet given on earth. Now, have you done </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">your </span><span class="font2">part to prepare for this period? Are you ready? Is the territory which you are going to cover all prepared and outlined for the publishers? Do the publishers know where they will go, and when to start? Have you tried to fix a definite amount of time to spend in the service on certain days? Have you been scouting around seeking locations for the special lecture “Universal Wab Neab” by electrical transcription? Have you ordered your literature? Is it in the bookroom, ready for the brethren? Is your unit ready for the onward march on April 13? Have you thoroughly organized the work for the first Saturday and Sunday? Are you prepared particularly for the Thursday witnessing? Have you made it possible for every Jonadab or other person of good will to get into the service? Do they have a copy of Brother Rutherford’s letter? Do they have a testimony card?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Keep in mind, dear brethren, that this a world-wide thanksgiving period, a time of joy, a time of praise to Jehovah. It is a time of celebrating the Memorial of our Lord’s death. Prepare now, and be ready for united action with all the publishers throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Period includes the Memorial season. All who partake of the symbols, of course, will want to have a very large part in the reality and drink deeply of the cup that Jehovah has poured for them at this time. Although the Jonadabs and other people of good will are not privileged to partake of the emblems in Memorial, they are blessed by being given the privilege of being associated witnesses with the anointed in proclaiming the purposes of Jehovah. Therefore each one should see to it that he has some part in the witness during this testimony period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The last </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font2"> outlined the details regarding the preliminary steps, preparation of territory, and making all arrangements so that the mightiest witness to date may be given during The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Period. Our particular part in the witness is not so much the placing of literature. From many angles that is beyond our control. The time devoted to the service, however, is something that we can control to a very great extent, and our devotion and loyalty are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page S, column</span><span class="font2"> i)</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Time! Time!! </span><span class="font6">Time!!!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">That’s One Thing That We Seem Not to Have Enough Of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You get up in the morning, and before you know it it’s time to go to bed; and during that time that you are awake and active, how many of those hours have you spent in witnessing as a publisher for Jehovah’s kingdom? Then, the question can be asked, how many hours of an entire month are spent in witnessing? Consider carefully the following, taken over four months’ time:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLISHERS’ AVERAGE HOURS FEB MONTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mini-1935 1934 1933 mum</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark7"><span class="font2">Pioneers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;95.6 &nbsp;98.5 &nbsp;95.7</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark8"><span class="font2">Auxiliaries &nbsp;&nbsp;46.2 &nbsp;48.8 &nbsp;46.8</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark9"><span class="font2">and SS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.2 &nbsp;13.2 &nbsp;11.1</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now that you have considered the “time” table, the first question is, Why are we back to a 1933 average instead of ahead of our 1934 average? or, Why are we not as good, as far as time is concerned, as last year?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers, could you arrange to find 15 more hours a month, so as to bring your monthly average up to 110 hours?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Auxiliaries, could you find 4 more extra hours in 30 days that could be spent in the witness?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Company and sharpshooter publishers, in 1934 you lacked less than 2 hours of making the average of 15 hours a month, which each one should consider a minimum of time for field service. However, in 1935 we have slipped back behind this minimum to the amount of 4 hours. Time is the one thing that the publishers of Jehovah’s kingdom seem not to have enough of; and the Kingdom testimony being the most important thing, everything else that requires our time should be secondary to the witness. Let every one of us consider seriously how each one can during March and April reach at least our minimum time. If each one takes the responsibility upon himself to do at least the minimum, we know for sure that the average will then be well over the 110 hours for pioneers, the 50 hours for auxiliaries, and 15 hours a month for company publishers. Why? Because many of the publishers have arranged matters so that time in Kingdom witnessing is the most important thing and everything else is secondary, and therefore the amount of time devoted to the Kingdom service far exceeds the amount of time spent in any other manner.</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase in Everything, but Behind in “Hour” Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The figures showing the witness accomplished by all publishers reporting to this ofiice so far this fiscal year, that is, for the four months of October, November and December, 1934, and January, 1935, reveal Jehovah’s rich blessing on the effort ' made by those who are publishing the name and kingdom of the Most High. It is always of interest to compare current activities with preceding results; and so below is a table setting out the totals of all pioneer, auxiliary, company and sharpshooter reports for the first four months of this fiscal year, and those of the corresponding period a year ago, and the increase this year over last:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Thursday Set Aside for Special Witness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Leaders Can Serve Companies During Period </span><span class="font2">In harmony with the general arrangement, the Society’s office, factory and Bethel home will be closed Thursday, April 18, in order to enable the Bethel family to have one day in the middle of the week to enter into the field service with the brethren throughout the earth. This Thursday witnessing has been a great blessing to the brethren throughout the country. In The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Pebiod this day should be of special significance. Everyone should try to be relieved from his secular employment on that day so as to have a part in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As you know, Wednesday evening</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Have You Ordered Your Booklets?</span></h4>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>None Will Be Consigned</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">If there are any pioneers, auxiliaries, companies or sharpshooters who have not yet ordered their supply of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">His Vengeance, Supremacy, </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font2"> for their service during The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Pebiod, April 13-21, it will be very necessary for these to send in their orders at once, so as to get the literature in time to begin with it on April 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As previously stated, none of these have been consigned to any publishers, and they must be ordered for a supply to reach you. A special order blank was sent with the last </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> and should be used by all who have received it. If, however, you do not have this special form and have not yet ordered the booklets, do so at once, using a regular order blank, or the coupon which you find in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> or a letter, and include any other literature that you may need for your stock following the period. Accompany orders with remittance to cover if you do not have an account at this office or if your account is not in good condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">bound books, 320,352 were placed during the two months of December and January, during which time three of the bound books were placed on a contribution of 50c. The quota for these two months was, as you will recall, 300,000. In January the total of 189,227 bound books was the largest number placed during any one month since May, 1931, when 277,406 were placed, the offer at that time being four on a contribution of one dollar, for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The increase as shown in the foregoing is very good. However, we must not complacently rest on the accomplishments of the year thus far, but must realize that in one point in particular there is much room for improvement by all the publishers as a whole. That is in the number of hours per publisher. While the total of hours is an increase of 8,697 over that of a year ago, there is an even greater comparative increase of 2,240 publishers. Multiplying the total of hours (1,701,993 for the four months) by 3, to arrive at a possible twelve-month total, we have 5,105,979 hours. The quota for the year is 5,500,000 hours; and by diligent effort on the part of the publishers during the most favorable part of the year ahead, the quota will be reached and exceeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">preceding is the time when all the anointed partake of the Memorial, on the 14th day of Nisan. The 14th day of Nisan continues until sunset of Thursday, the following day. It seems appropriate, therefore, that the Lord’s people everywhere should endeavor to spend this day in the service of the King if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As usual, service leaders will be sent out for Saturday afternoon and Sunday at the beginning and at the end of this period, that is, Saturday afternoon and Sunday April 13 and 14, and Saturday afternoon and Sunday April 20 and 21. Those companies desiring service leaders on those dates, please make your request as soon as possible, so that proper arrangements can be made. This applies to an area within 200 miles of Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 4) </span><span class="font2">Some pioneers average as high as 180 hours a month; some auxiliaries, as high as 80 hours a month; some company publishers, as high as 25 hours a month. Just that we may be sure to exceed by many, many hours the year’s quota of 5j million hours, why not try this?—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers, 6 days a week, 5 hours witnessing each day, equal 30 hours a week; 4 weeks in a month—there you have it—120 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Auxiliaries, why not spend 3 hours a day on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and then 4 hours on Sunday, or on such days as are most convenient to yourself? You will average 13 hours a week. Four weeks will make 52 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Company publishers in most instances have every Saturday afternoon off, and all day Sunday. A good many persons are working only part time and will be able to put in an hour or two in city territory on some day of the week, particularly Thursday. Why not make a special effort to put in 2 hours on Thursday or Saturday, and at least 3 hours on Sunday? That would make it 5 hours a week. Many publishers can do much more than this; but you</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonographs and Transcription Machines Play Large Part in the Witness </span><span class="font2">During The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Pebiod, April 13-21, everyone who is the possessor of a transcription machine or some sound equipment that can use the 16-inch discs should keep this machine busy daily during this special period by running the lecture “UnTvebsal Wab Neab”. It is hoped that during this particular period there will be a large increase in the number of meetings held, and that the attendance at these meetings will be greater than in the previous world-wide campaign, last fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every available place where people congregate, such as parks, play grounds, halls, or arrangements being made in homes, should be taken</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Memorial Report</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">It is during The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Pebiod that Jehovah’s witnesses will have the privilege of celebrating the Memorial. As </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> points out, the celebration will take place after 6 p.m. Wednesday, April 17. A report of the attendance at the Memorial has always been sent to the Society. This year we desire to have two reports; namely, (1) total number attending the Memorial service, and (2) total number of persons partaking of the Memorial emblems. This report should be entered on the regular monthly report card, in the blank space at the bottom of the card. In other words, immediately under the last printed line on the monthly report card, you will write “1. Total attending Memorial services ........”, and “2. Total partaking</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of Memorial emblems ........”. By so</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">doing it will not be necessary to send in a separate letter, as the director, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries can mark it on their report. The pioneers or auxiliaries who are associated with a company in partaking of the Memorial will, of course, be included on the company report card, and they should not enter it on their own report card.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Order This Special Packet of 50 Booklets if You Have Not Ordered Otherwise, So that You May Have a Part in the Special Witness Period, April 13-21</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Everyone who is truly interested in Jehovah’s kingdom established on the earth will necessarily want to have a part in the advertising of that kingdom. The dates April 13-21 are set aside as a special period called The Anointed’s Thanksgiving Pebiod, and during this time all people of good will should have a keen desire to be a publisher of the message of the Kingdom, which is the only hope of the world. Why not have a part in this special period and obtain 50 booklets, on a contribution of only $1.00, which will be used to print more of these publications?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The packet is composed o’f the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">10 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Supremacy</span><span class="font2"> 10 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">His Vengeance </span><span class="font2">30 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1 Testimony Card 1 Report Card</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These booklets in turn can be offered to the people, three on a contribution of 10c, or the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font2"> can be left advantage of. This lecture Brother Rutherford delivered on January 13, from Los Angeles, is a most stirring and timely lecture, and it is of vital importance for the publishers of Jehovah to see to it that this particular message reaches the ears of those who are willing to hear.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">can see that if you could do this weekly you would have 20 hours for the month. Let’s make a schedule and then, by the Lord’s grace, stick to it, and it will surely be an honor to His name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Along with the work of the sound machines, of course, is included the phonograph, and every available opportunity should be seized so as to demonstrate and make it possible for these people to hear these very fine short lectures. Make reports of your sound equipment, whether it be sound car, transcription machine or phonograph, on the regular report card, so that a complete record may be had of the work accomplished during this Thanksgiving Period of the anointed. “He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 3) </span><span class="font2">manifest by putting in as much time as we possibly can. The Lord will add the increase in the way of results. This testimony period, coming, as it does, after the Lord has given his people the wonderful explanation of the Gideon picture, showing the various progressive steps in his organization from the gathering and assembling of those who claim to be on his side to the final victory by his invisible forces, affords all of the Lord’s anointed an opportunity to manifest their appreciation and love of Jehovah for all his great goodness toward them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let each one, therefore, go forward as Brother Rutherford instructs in his letter, with the testimony card bearing the testimony, hand it to the people at the proper time and let them read it, and then present the literature. Every publisher should have a testimony card to present to the people in his territory who speak a different language. Do not simply go out with an English testimony card when you know that there are Italian, Polish and French people in the territory. Take a testimony card and literature in each of the languages there spoken, so that you will be in a position to supply the needs of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">with the people on only a penny contribution, or given to them if they are really interested and are unable to contribute anything. You may be assured that you will receive a great blessing in doing this.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Arrangements Under Way so Brother Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Can Speak to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">All “Christendom”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Those Attending</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to Have Part in Witness</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All of Jehovah’s publishers throughout the entire earth are turning their minds towards Washington, D. C., praying and looking forward to the general convention which the Lord, in his providence, is arranging to be held there on May 30 to June 3 this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is needless to call to the attention of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> readers the remarkable manner in which the Lord has used these general conventions in the past, and how each one of them was fraught with greater importance and significance than those preceding it. Therefore it behooves everyone who can do so to put forth a very strenuous effort to attend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The outstanding feature of the convention will be the public address by Brother Rutherford, on Sunday afternoon, June 2. This lecture is to be widely advertised throughout Washington and vicinity, inviting the people there to come to the Washington Auditorium and hear the speech. This lecture will also be advertised throughout the continent, Inviting the people to tune in to the. nation-wide network. In addition to the nation-wide network in the United States, it. will include stations and public-address systems in all the principal countries linked together by means of telephone lines, overseas . radiotelephone circuit,. radio beam and short-wave facilities, making it possible, by the gracious provision of Jehovah, for all brethren and people of good will throughout the earth to hear this vital message. The responsibility rests upon each publisher to see that this is thoroughly advertised</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Territory en Route</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Read Carefully</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From every part of the land the Lord’s people will. come to the convention at Washington, D. C., May .30 to June 3. Some of the pioneers may find it necessary to break the trip to the convention by several days’ field service a time or two along the way. In the interests of the service and the brethren, let all journeying to the convention follow this arrangement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is entirely in order to witness Io anyone you meet en route, and to place literature with them. This includes people at the service stations, camp grounds where you may stay, other than the house-to-house field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As for the regular witnessing from bouse to house: It la better, saving in his own territory before attending the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As outlined ■ In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">announcements, this is to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> service convention. Therefore it is not only Important to attend the con. vention, but even of greater Importance to have a part in the service of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All of Jehovah’S publishers, both remnant and Jonadabs, should see that they are properly registered and are assigned a definite place in the service activity at that time. In order to assign territory it is quite necessary for everyone to register quickly upon arrival. In doing this the following procedure will be followed: The convention committee at Washington will supply registration slips for all car groups. In the case of companies and sharpshooters these will be supplied through their local service director. In the case of isolated car groups these registration slips will be sent direct upon request. When these car groups arrive at the convention it will not be necessary for each individual in the car to register personally. The car driver will have filled out the regular registration slip which he will receive and will turn it in at the registration desk at the convention, where he will receive territory and car number, announcements for the public address, and such other information as may be required for carrying on the work. Those who do not come by car and who are not included in a car group will register personally at the registration booth, where all arrangements will be made for their service work. Full details will be furnished, to all those attending the convention, well in advance, by the convention committee which has charge of ail the preparations at Washington. It will not be necessary to bring your own literature to the convention, as an adequate supply will be there. However, be sure to bring your witnessing case, your testimony envelope, and identification card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">time, for the journey to be made straight through to your destination. Certainly do not witness from house to house unless yon hold the assignment for the territory. Any pioneers who find it necessary to spend a few days from time to time in door-to-door service along the way will best co-operate with the various companies through whose territory they pass, getting their local assignments from the service director. It is not necessary for a special assignment to be issued from this office for such witnessing with a company en route. If an assignment of isolated territory is necessary, obtain it from this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneers should have assigned to them beforehand plenty of territory for their service following the convention, as such assignments cannot be made nt Washington.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">A Time for Thanksgiving </span><span class="font4">Will You Be One of Those Expressing Thanhs?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Will There Be 25,000 Publishers Witnessing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every one of the remnant and other persons of good will, each one of the Jonadab class, all who love Jehovah, should be, and are, greatly interested in the special period of testimony just ahead, known as Ths Anointed’s Thanksgiving Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">When ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The nine days of April 13-21 inclusive are set aside for this period. This includes the day of celebration of the memorial of Jesus’ death; of Jehovah’s vindication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To show their sincere gratitude to Jehovah, the Source of all light and life, his people earnestly desire to participate in testifying to his King and kingdom, in obedience to his command, and it is completely appropriate that this thanksgivingperiod be held. To be consistent, those of the anointed, partaking of the Memorial emblems, must have an active personal part in the reality signified by the bread and the wine: participation in Kingdom service with their Head, who ‘has come’ and is drinking with them the true wine of the Kingdom. Those who are not of the‘anointed class but who have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah, to be consistent, will, also, take part in carrying to</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>No Divisional Campaign May 25 and 26</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">In view of the general convention at Washington, May 30 to June 3, and the fact that a great number of the brethren throughout the country contemplate attending the convention, the Society has canceled the divisional campaign for May 25 and 26. These are not to be held. This time can be well spent in seeing that the radio announcements advertising Brother Rutherford’s public speech at the convention are thoroughly distributed throughout your territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Use New Report Cards</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters, and service directors are requested to send in only ONE new report card for the month of April. The entire month’s report (April 1 to 30 inclusive) should be recorded in the upper row of spaces. Your report for the Thanksgiving Period of April 13-21 should be made on the SAME card, only recorded in the lower row of spaces. Of course, your Thanksgiving Period activities should also be included in your entire month’s report made in the upper row of spaces. others the message of truth to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">What litekatube?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new publications released to the public on April 13, the three new booklets, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Supremacy, His Vengeance,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Huie the World?</span><span class="font1"> are to be offered to the people, the entire combination, all three, on a contribution of 10c. To aid In the placement of this combination, the testimony Brother Rutherford provided has been printed on a card and supplied to all the publishers of whom we have a record. See to it that you are provided with one of these cards, and an ample supply of the booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">What tekritoby?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To make the witness during the period as effective as possible, urban territory should be covered, generally, reaching as many people as can be called upon. Some service directors and car drivers, while witnessing la towns, follow the practice of giving to each publisher in the group only sufficient territory to last for half an hour or so, sometimes only a few calls, moving the publishers frequently. This should not be done. It results in loss of time for each one in the field, and prevents the driver of the car from personally going from house to house, as he takes up his time driving around moving those who ai-e witnessing. Each publisher should be given enough territory to keep him busy for a long period of time, several hours, and the one driving the car can then also take part in calling on the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">What about sound machines?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Universal War Near” is the lecture to be given as frequently as possible during the period, and while in the field the publishers should watch for openings for using the sound equipment with this lecture. Sound machine activities should be included in the report for the period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">And now, the publishees?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There was mailed to every </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscriber a lei ter written by Brother Rutherford setting out the importance of this period. Also, each one received detailed instructions in the March </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font1"> as well as a testimony card. All the publisher needs to do is to order the three booklets, find territory, plan his time in the field, and then get going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But now, the publishers? Will there be 25,000 reporting for the nine-day period? There should he; and we hope there will be. Every one who has ever witnessed will have to share in the work, because the highest number ever reporting in the U. S. A. was 24,500 publishers. What will it he April 13-21? 25.000? 27,000?? 30,000???</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Month of February Finds 185,790 Listeners</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">More than 1,900 Machines in Operation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By sound equipment, of course, we mean all the instruments Jehovah has placed in our hands whereby the transcription records can be used on machines such as portable transcription machines, phonographs and sound cars. A very wide witness has been given during the month of February alone, with more than 185,000 listeners. Now that spring is here and summer is coming, the weather opening up to get out in parks and public places, this attendance should continue to increase. From the reports it seems as though not all of the sound equipment that is available to the brethren is being used regularly, or, if it is, it is not being reported to the Society. There are surely more than 1,933 phonographs, transcription machines and sound cars in the United States using the 331-r.p.m. transcription records and the 12&quot; phonograph discs. Directors, pioneers and sharpshooters should set out the importance of the use of this equipment and see to it that it is reported each month in your monthly report card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A new series for the spring and summer is now arranged for. Folders are being printed. No. 1 folder will contain the advertisement for the lectures “Universal War Near” and “Shall Truth Be Suppressed?” The second folder will advertise the lectures “Who Shall Rule the World?” “Knowledge and Understanding,” “Desolating Abominations,” “Famine,” “Praying for Prosperity.” These seven lectures should be used regularly in series in as many places as they can possibly be used. Folders can be had at the regular rate, 40c for 1000</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IMPORTANT NOTICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The placement of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font1"> booklets should be counted and reported together with the other booklets in the column on report card marked “Total Booklets Placed”. If you have failed to report </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font1"> booklet or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity-Famine</span><span class="font1"> booklet placements heretofore, include those placed prior to April 1 also in your report for the month of March or April. The Society desires an accurate report of the placement of all booklets published by the Society. Whether those booklets have colored covers or plain paper covers, are placed free or on contribution, makes no difference; all should be accounted for to this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Publisher’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Daily Report Slips</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society has now in stock a supply of new publisher’s daily report slips. These new report slips are for the convenience of the individual company and sharpshooter publishers to make their field service reports to the service director or sharpshooter with whom they are associated. These new daily report slips are similar to the new report cards recently sent to the directors and sharpshooters. On the reverse side of these slips is printed a complete set of report instructions for the individual publishers. Supplies of these will be sent without charge to the companies and sharpshooter arrangements requesting them. Please state on your request the quantity desired. However, these new report slips should not be used until the old slips have been used up. folders. Two of the lectures are one hour in length, and the others only a half hour. This makes it possible to have a study after the lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new phonograph records are also available, the total number of which is now 35 different lectures. Reports from the brethren throughout the land show that the phonograph is very useful in arranging for the transcription meetings. In other words, two or three phonograph lectures are given in different homes; these people are then requested to assemble at one home, at which time the 16&quot; discs are used. It is well then to circularize and advertise thoroughly the series of meetings in that vicinity, using the two new folders, which will be available in the next few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You can, however, continue in different sections of the cities with the old series until the discs which you have are worn out. Discs that do not reproduce the lectures satisfactorily should be destroyed. It is essential to present the message of truth to the people in a clear-toned manner in which Brother Rutherford does present it on good records. If the records become old and worn, do not use them, as this is irritating to the listeners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All will be interested in the February report. Can we make the April and May reports much better?</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Records in Spanish</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There has been quite a demand for these Spanish phonograph records, and many of the English-speaking brethren have found these very effective in proclaiming the message of the Kingdom in sections where there are large numbers of Spanishspeaking people. Discs are 70c each.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">G.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not only pioneers in isolated territory, but all publishers in other territory as well, meet interested persons while going from house to house with the Kingdom message. Some effort should be made to have closer contact between the organization of the Lord’s people and those who are favorable toward the truth, in order that the people who desire to do so may take their stand on the side of Jehovah, co-operate with the remnant, and manifest their good will. When those called upon expressed their deep appreciation of the message, and, having already obtained the literature, did not procure more, generally in the past the publisher has simply gone to the next house, forgetting the person just seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is here suggested that a splendid way to put these in touch with the Society would be to take their subscription for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font1"> or both. The information and instruction carried by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> is of greatest importance to all who take their stand</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Business Territory</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Is It Being Covered in Your Assignment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To insure a more thorough witness in the business districts it seems advisable to again mention the policy of the Society in respect to business territory. As we know, business districts are to be covered by pioneers on assignment from this office unless the company or sharpshooter in the territory has specially requested and received the business assignment as part of the general assignment of the local organization. We are glad to thus assign the business territory to companies and sharpshooters in those cases where the company publishers themselves, together with any permanently resident auxiliaries or pioneers, can thoroughly cover the business districts twice a year, and assure us that they will do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The purpose of thus distinguishing business districts from other territory was solely to insure their being well witnessed to, in view of the fact that many of the publishers studiously avoid business territory, and, they carrying on much of their service over the week-ends, business districts might be neglected by companies if assigned to them without special assurance that they would be covered. This also provided considerable urban territory for pioneers specializing in business sections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The condition which should now be overcome, and, by hearty cooperation on the part of all concerned, can be overcome, is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So few of the companies hold the assignments for the business districts in their territory that there are not enough pioneers specializing in business districts to cover those not assigned to pioneers. This does not apply merely to large cities, but especially to cities of ten thousand, fifteen thousand, and twenty-five thousand in which companies are organized but in which the business territory is not covered by the company, and which may not constitute an assignment large enough to justify sending a pioneer there for the business territory only. To advance the witness the publishers can cooperate as follows: on the side of Jehovah. Announcements of organization instructions, including periods of special witness, are found therein. The activities of Jehovah’s witnesses are also set forth in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font1"> together with convenient coupons for those interested to use in writing direct to the Society for field service arrangements. Those receiving these publications will continually have their attention drawn to their privileges of service, and will not be at a loss as to how to proceed when their interest reaches a point where they desire to participate. Pioneers and auxiliaries may send in these subscriptions direct; company and sharpshooter publishers, through the local organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Interested persons in company and sharpshooter territory should be put in touch with the local service organization. Those found in isolated territory should personally communicate with the Society when they wish to be lined up for witnessing. Instead of pioneers’ writing us that such and such a person is interested and that we should write to that one, they should advise the person to write to this office himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Companies: With the increase in witnessing through the week, not only on Thursdays, but on other weekdays, the majority of the companies, especially in small cities, should be able to cover their business territory. No longer should the publishers studiously avoid business districts. Let the service director bring the matter before the company, and if it is seen definitely that the company publishers, together with any resident auxiliaries or pioneers, can cover the business territory twice a year, and will do so, the director should write this office, giving this assurance, and receive for the company the assignment for the business districts. The responsibility would be on the company, when the assignment is made, to see to it that the witness is given in the business territory, even as it has the responsibility for the residential and rural sections. When such an assignment is made to the company, the director is to make the local assignments of business districts to any company publishers, auxiliaries, or pioneers assigned with the company. Unless the company can handle the business territory in this way, the director is not to make application. Let pioneers apply for such territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sharpshooters : The same procedure would apply to the sharpshooters as applies to companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Isolated territory: Pioneers in isolated territory should thoroughly cover all business districts in the counties assigned to them, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many of the pioneers hold assignments for entire isolated counties on the old forms which call for a detailed report on each town separate from the rurals. This detailed information need not be given. On the assignment sheet show the totals for the entire county, stating thereon the bound books chiefly placed, and also the thoroughness with which the county was witnessed to. It is not necessary to make a sound machine report on the territory report, neither of phonograph nor of transcription machine.</span></p>

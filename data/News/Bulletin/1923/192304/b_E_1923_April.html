<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark1"></a>EARTH’S NEW GOVERNMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">there shall be no end”—Isaiah 9: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">W</span><span class="font5">HEN<sup>-</sup> a reformed political party has fought a campaign to a successful end, there is great rejoicing amongst those who sympathize with the new arrangement. Great crowds larch in p&amp;rade. They sing songs of victory, carry torches and banners, indulge in much oratory and feasting. Why? Because they believe they are now beginning to have a government that will guard well the interests of the people and increase their prosperity and happiness. Such have always been disappointed; for Satan, the god of the old world, has always overreached every effort at honest reformation. Long ago God instructed the people that they must wait until he shall come whose right it is, and then a government of lasting peace and happiness shall be enj’oyed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Once Prophecies—Now Actually Existing</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Never was the world in greater need of such a government of righteousness than now. It is but necessary for one to glance at Europe to see the deplorable condition in which the peoples and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">nations are now floundering. Russia, once a mighty empire of strength, has decayed until she has practically no government. Germany, once a mighty nation, rich and arrogant, is now reduced to penury. Her people are starving and, seeing they must die, are indulging in excessive wickedness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Throes the Newspapers Hide</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age of March 14, 1923, page 371, concerning Germany says: “The laboring people are nearly despairing. The most necessary requirements of daily life cannot be obtained any more, although the men earn high wages. Alongside of this, a horrible system of profiteering makes itself felt in ever-widening circles, since some of the more intelligent manage, like carrionvultures, to prey upon the poverty-stricken people. Large numbers evidently seek to forget their misery by great dissoluteness, as though seized by a frenzy. In many places a craze for danci</span><span class="font5"><sup>r</sup> has ta'Ken lioici on great masses of people. The government seen.., to be powerless to stop it. In spite of the inhibition, the dancing goes on in secret. The country is in the condition of one dreaming and shaking with fever, and the process of dying is on.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Symptoms in your Midst</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Many other nations of the world are in as bad and some in worse condition. In America, the land which has been favored more than all others, there goes on without shame or hindrance a system of heartless profiteering in utter disregard of the rights of the people. Upon every hand there are'distress and perplexity. Despair and dread are written upon the faces of men everywhere. They have tried every form of government, and all have failed to bring relief. They have reached their extremity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Work of Lasting Good</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">What an opportunity for the Christian! Nearly nineteen centuries ago Jesus began selecting those who shall be with him in the new government. In 1874 he returned and began gathering unto himself those saints who have proven faithful, and began preparing to overthrow the usurper’s system of unrighteousness. In 1914 he took unto himself his power and began dashing to pieces Satan’s empire. While Satan and his emissaries fight against the. Lord and righteousness, the people suffer and groan. They have long thus been suffering and groaning in pain, waiting for the manifestation of the Messianic kingdom.—Romans 8:19, 22.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Great Climax Reached</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Now all the faithful ^rv^pta of the Lord can go forth with rejoicing and with authority proclaim to the people that the day of deliverance is at, hand. They can with certainty say now: ‘Unto us a King is given, and the new government shall be upon hi.s shoulder; his name is Wonderful, he is mighty, he will give life to those who obey him; he is the long-looked-for Prince of Peace. Of his government and peace there shall be no end.’ Concerning his reign they are authorized to say: “With righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark13"></a>“Serve.with Godly Fear.” Heb. 12:28</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Now they can say to the people: ‘Seek meekness, seek righteousness; and during this great time of stress that is now upon the world you may be shielded from the worst of the trouble. Look up and lift up your heads; for the Messianic government now beginning shall bring the desire of every honest heart.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark15"></a>First Step—Primary Principles</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Never before have Christians had such a blessed opportunity as now. Are you doing your part, and are you doing it joyfully? The most effective way of telling the glad tidings to suffering humanity is to induce them to read. To do this they must have books. The Harp of God contains a brief and succinct statement of the divine plan and produces proof conclusive that the kingdom is here, and that millions now living will never die. Let the class organizations everywhere put forth their best efforts to get this into the hands of the people; to organize Harp study classes and get the minds of the people turned in the way of righteousness. Later this will be followed by more advanced classes in the Studies in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Joy of Helping Others</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There is much now to be done. Those who are doing it are receiving the blessings. Those who have entered into the joy of the Lord will be anxious to do this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">AU </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">other efforts at reformation in the past- Jwe- failed. Now </span><span class="font5">the absolute and certain remedy for the ills of humankind is here. Let every one of Zion now be active in the proclamation of the message of the new King and his kingdom. Slack not thine hand‘d but let every one do with his might what his hand finds to do.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Greater Study Sales in Back Call</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Again we emphasize the importance of the class workers confining themselves to the Harp Study Course, leaving the work of canvassing for the eight volumes as a combination to the colporteurs for the present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With Christian greetings, we are</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">METHODS OF WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you allude to your book, closely associate it with the neou that it is to satisfy in such a manner that when the people recognize their need, the book that will satisfy it will come to mind. At tin-people feel that they should devote themselves to some Scriptural ret <sup>; </sup>ing; then our books should come to their mind. The appeal shoe io suggest, first the need, and then the article. Thus Studies in Tire Scriptures remind one of the books that one should use when studyi: ... the Scriptures. When people feel that they could do some Bible studying, the Harp will, if you have spoken to them of the Habp Bible Stu: w Course, naturally come to mind when they feel that they shc.dd gi &lt;&nbsp;some time to devotion. This is what is meant when we say .'r: suggesting a need you should also mention the means of g’ up' ,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">to meet a stranger: and since you have taken Gie initiative — maki: , the call the anticipation is that you have something important to sac Since you know that this is the attitude of the people as they come the door, you should endeavor to shape your remarks so as immediate! to gain their attention and hold it. The first remarks you make n. them are the important ones. It is upon these remarks that you hav&gt;-to depend in order to have them hear all you intend to say, and ah-■ to obtain a favorable impression. People are more inclined to give you their attention when you have favorably impressed them than wbi, you are vague in your remarks and leave them endeavoring to ascertain what is the purpose of your call. Hence the first remarks should hr-something that, will take them by surprise, that will arouse the ? curiosity and make them feel that in due course you will give them the information that you have intimated in your opening remarks. To-, often the advantage to be gained in the first remarks is lost becau . an attempt is made to explain to the individual that you have call (a matter that is obvious to them by your presence), and then • explain why you have called and how important you consider th■: matter about which you have come to talk to them. We believe mo will be gained by getting right down to the matter of discussing 1 subject that is most important in your canvass. If the interest of t; individual is not aroused immediately, it often provides him with tlr-excuse, or rather .justifies him in cutting you short in your canvass by saying that he is not interested. Hence if you can obtain sow information regarding the individual you are to call upon from t: person you have previously canvassed, you are in a position of adva tage when you call at the next house. No doubt the success of t worker in making a sale to an infidel mentioned in the following lett was due to her approaching the gentleman along lines that interest</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gaining Respect</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Also it is well to recognize that people you call upon will give yon more respect if you use well-chosen expressions. Colloquial slang and an attempt to imitate- the townspeople by trying to use their crude expressions often impress those whom you are canvassing that you do not have the proper regard or respect for the message you present; for they feel that you have reduced it to the level of the individuals of that town. They will respect you insofar as you attempt to be a good ex-ample to them, not only in conduct, but in bringing to their attention items that are of real interest to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Your call, to be a successful one, must be managed. Sometimes people answer the door bell and try to carry on a conversation because something is weighing upon their minds, and they will attempt to di;&gt; cuss this. After they have unburdened themselves, of course they have no time to hear what you have come to tell them. Obviously an order cannot be expected when individuals are permitted to direct the issue of your call. Since you have in mind what you have come to speak t; them about, it depends upon you to manage the call so as to give thei the information you intended when you decided to call. When comment, along other lines are interjected, they could be dealt with very coin teously and very briefly, but should never be allowed to break the trem, of your canvass. Answer their inquiry or comment upon their remarks, but immediately return to that part of the canvass where you were</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">StMpe nernanm tor inrerestea</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where you are called upon to canvass an individual when <sup>1 </sup>two others are present it is difficult to suit your remarks to the company. Hence, if you find that one is more or less oppos another holds strong convictions, you can probably so direct ,on remarks to these individuals as to impress others, rather than sui render and feel that there is no opportunity to make a sale in this instance. The brother writing us gives a good example of what 1-meant here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">you that he hasn’t read them. A dentist from across the street who had been attracted by the Reverend’s loud talking said : ‘I want to buy a set of those books.’ So I sold him a combination : and when I turned to thank the Reverend Gill for helping me to make the sale, I found that he had vanished.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Avery Brietow, Nebr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Keeping your Remarks Interesting</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you have gotten attention, your remarks are to be such as develop this attention into interest; and interest will not be long manifested unless you continue to keep your remarks interesting. This would suggest that your canvass should bring out a succession of new points, : nd that they be arranged in such a manner as to come in proper order ' r sequence, one item of interest that you have talked of or mentioned aturally leading to the next item of interest, not because you have arranged it so in your canvass, but bemuse the natural trend of thought </span><span class="font3">, ’ Ine </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font3"> fVifj pAffO&quot; VDH «'»•&lt;-» f Q 1 Jr : </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rr</span><span class="font3"> 4- </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">t-r,</span><span class="font3"> 4-V&gt; • r. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ol &gt;,, , 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;T«1</span></p>

'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'articipating in your Conversation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another obstacle that you have to overcome is the feeling that eople have when meeting strangers. They are ill at ease. They are . 'ondering what the person that has called upon them is thinking of hem. They are not so much concerned with what they think of you at greatly occupied with the impression that they are making upon , ou; for they feel that you are going to call on other people and will naturally compare them with others, and it is a human trait to want o be well thought of. Attention that is interested and will progress •ith your canvass is more likely to result successfully if by some act '.f friendliness you can overcome this feeling of strangeness so that a •iendly feeling can be established : and one of the best ways is to see &gt;&nbsp;it that what you are saying has a warmth of expression. Facts and rguments coldly and stoically presented can hardly awaken interest; nd the one canvassing has failed to overcome one of the greatest bstacles, namely, that of being a stranger to the person to whom you re talking. A successful way to encourage friendliness and maintain iterest is to ask questions which merely require the nod of the head ; i answer or a simple yes or no. When arguments are direct and specific ley lose their effect, and thus the person you are calling upon is not .acouraged to participate in the conversation. They think that what on are saying is thought out for them and that all they have to do is : i accept it; whereas people like to discover things for themselves. In lort, nothing is left to their imagination. They have not been permit-id to discover anything for themselves. Everything has been discovered end brought out for them. Consequently they feel that you have i-&gt; oned everything, that they have all of the information that the hoc;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">’.ite points you have mentioned, it is hardly worth their investment ■ ■ methods used by the colporteur writing us as follows are excellent, ,t&lt;.d Illustrate by example what we have stated above:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“One day this week while it was snowing along toward noon I went into a little store in the edge of town. I stood by the counter a moment and picked up a Bible. I turned to Job 38 : 35 and soon as he was through with his customer, I began to talk about the telephone that is mentioned by Job that did not need any wires. This man had been a Sunday School teacher for thirty-five years and as I canvassed him for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Harp Study Course</span><span class="font3"> he interrupted me in a very kind way by saying, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Is it possible</span><span class="font3"> that I have been teaching a class thirty-five years and have been leading them the wrong way?’ He said, ‘I am going to buy that book and see.’ With this he threw me down 50 cents. Then he said, ‘What would you think of a man that sells tobacco in his store no matter if it does harm?’ I said, Well, I could not do it. He said, ‘That is the one thing I resolved not to do any longer beginning the first of January this year; and what do you know, when I told our minister what I had done, the minister said. “Don’t you fear you have made a mistake in that you may lose some business?” ’ I said, Big Business, Big Politics, and Big Preachers; with a little faith Christ will work all things for our good. lie clasped his hands and said, ‘I believe you told the truth.’ ”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Clarence W.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Practice Gets the Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though the principles mentioned above may be employed and with j. uch success, yet we do not wish to leave the Impression that their <sub>;</sub> hctice will accomplish a sale at every house, but it is certain that heir practice will accomplish more sales than the violation of the . ’inciples set forth; and, too, being aware of these principles and m ethods and not seeking an opportunity to practice them will accomplish little. It is the continual practice that obtains results in the end, and the most effective means of obtaining this continued practice is to h &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in setting aside time for service.

<p><span class="font3">“My sales were not so great, but it was the blessing and development I was receiving myself. That night as I was getting ready to leave for home, I met an acquaintance and sold him a combination. I was standing in the street showing him the books when a man hurried over and said : 'This is Mr. Bristow, isn’t it? Well, Mr. Bristow, I’ve heard that you’ve changed your life. You're leading a better life now. [I was considered quite a bad character once.] I’m glad of it, but you want to throw away those books you’ve got; they’re poison. My name is Gill, the Camphellite preacher.’ I said: Mr. Gill, have you read these books you are trying to condemn? ‘Well,’ he said, ‘I’ve read all the tracts and papers that have been handed out.’ That is not the question, I said; have you read these books you try to condemn? ‘Well, I’ve read the tracts and papers,’ he said.

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark1"></a>BE WISE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The King’s favor is toward a wise servant.”—Proverbs</span><span class="font2"> 14:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">P</span><span class="font2">EOPLE of the world love the favor of • their king. They are willing to make any sacrifice to obtain that favor. But when obtained, the favor of an earthly king is but as a fading flower. It is hollow and meaningless. He who obtains the favor of the King of kings and Lord of lords has gained a priceless jewel. His favor cannot be obtained by the use of anything this world can produce. He who obtains the favor of the great King must be wise. To be wise in God’s sight means to apply knowledge according to his holy will. His will is expressed in his Word; hence we must find from his Word what he would have us do and then do it joyfully. God is love. The King Christ Jesus is the express image of the Father. He is the fairest of ten thousand and altogether lovely. What, then, is the will of God concerning those who have made a covenant to be his servants ? The answer is, “This is the will of God concerning you, even your sanctification.” This means a complete setting aside of oneself and a devotion to the Lord and his cause. The motive inducing one to take this course mnst be love for Jehovah and the Lord Jesus out of a pure heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As one increases in appreciation of the Lord and the privilege of .being his representative, he grows in love. A wise servant, therefore, is one who loves the Lord with a pure heart and is thoroughly devoted to his cause. Now who shall have the King’s favor? “He that loveth with a pure heart and hath grace upon his lips shall have the King for his friend.” (Proverbs 22:11, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lesser) </span><span class="font2">Otherwise stated, it means that we must love the Lord and his cause, and that this love will induce us to speak gracious words concerning him and his cause, words of favor to mankind. Hence such a servant will be looking diligently for opportunities to glorify the Lord by telling others of his gracious provision for their salvation and blessing. He will possess that zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. Zeal is really love in action. It is like a fire of glowing coals, and this in one’s bones impels him to glorify the Lord by making known his gracious provisions for the relief of mankind. The poor world needs this sweet and comforting message now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The wise servant, therefore, is he who grasps the opportunities to tell others that the King is present; that his kingly authority is being exercised, and that the only solution for the ills of mankind is his kingdom. This message is contained in the Bible as explained in the Studies in the Scriptures and the “Harp of God” and other of our publications. Let us be wise, therefore, and put the message of the Lord into the hands of the people now. Those who are doing this understanding^ have entered into the joy of the Lord. Let us be wise and we shall be joyful; and if joyful, we shall be pleasing to our Lord and King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those who are serving the King now with a joyful heart are laying up treasures in heaven—-treasures which never can be destroyed by the molding canker, and which thieves cannot break in and steal, but a treasure that is ever enduring. These have much joy now in performing the duties of an ambassador of the King; and he who wisely performs the duties of that office will have the everlasting favor of Jehovah and the King of kings. He shall have an abundant entrance into his kingdom and with him participate in undoing all the evil that Satan has done, and witness and participate in bringing a generation to health, happiness, joy and peace. In the ages to come he will enjoy the exceeding riches of the grace of God. What a privilege now to represent the Lord, and the King 1 What a glorious prospect set before those who in wisdom perform the duties laid upon them! Every wise servant will now seek to put forth his best efforts to advertise the King and his kingdom. Let every follower of Jesus ask himself: Am I a wise servant according to the divine standard?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">METHODS OF WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The knowledge that each one possesses of the truth has been gleaned from the seven volumes of Studies in the Scbiptubes. The newly interested are pointed to the Studies in the Scbiptubes as the best helps for Bible students. The ultimate object of all canvassing during the past years has been to Interest the people sufficiently to get them to read the Studies in the Scbiptubes. Hence every effort that has been put forth was aimed to place the complete set of Studies in the homes. The launching of a campaign that would circulate complete sets was hindered first by the persecution of 1918, and later by the high cost of material. The past few years have overcome prejudice, and the interest manifested in the work has been such as to warrant the manufacturing of complete sets in sufficient quantities to procure a price that would be within the reach of the people. The Studies provide a complete reading matter and a full explanation of Bible themes. The Hakp Bible Study Course has laid out an orderly course of reading; but the Studies in the Scbiptubes must be depended upon to give a complete, detailed explanation of Bible themes. It is a distinct advantage to the people to have such a complete library in their homes during these troublesome times, indexed as it Is, topically and Scripturally, so as to permit the answering of their queries from the Bible viewpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A direct inquiry to colporteurs who were not canvassing for the sets of Studies in the Scbiptubes brought forth various replies. Examining these we believe that they are well summed up by the resume of the following colporteur:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“There is a quasi or pseudo conscientiousness with which some of us have been afflicted, and which is of the adversary, that makes us tend toward reticent agreement with the people lest we infract the Golden Ilule; whereas we should tie filled with a sure-enough conscientious and dogged persistence, fearing lest we should fail to place this boon within the reach of some honest and hungry souls.”—Roy D. Goodrich, Afias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Others have had the difficulty mentioned by the sister writing us as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“All the sets which I had sold previously I sold on first call; but I see now how I have been too timid in presenting same, being cowed down by cries of poverty raised by some. The Lord has made it plain to us what he wants us to do, and what the seasonable work is.”—Mrs. B. Abbott, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Conn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Still others who felt that they would. at least try the work out have obtained the results as the following letter discloses:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;I started out in earnest with the sets. Last week I sold and delivered one set. Saturday I took orders for three sets and delivered them all. It is Wednesday night, and I have sold seven sets this week, and we are out of sets. I did not think that I could sell them so well, but now I am enthusiastic about it. I have sent for ten sets; and now I am going to send for twenty more sets, I think I did not have faith enough, or I should have had more books here now’. I am surely glad that you urged us to try out the sets?’—Emma Martin. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In all, attacking the selling of sets in the spirit of the colporteur who writes us as follows is bound to obtain results:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I have used the advice from the Bible House since 1905, and I heard that wise and faithful servant qadviae the colporteur brethren to canvass</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">everybody, In order that we may get the right one. At all times I try to appear before the public as neat as possible. I keep my shoes shined, and my clothes neatly pressed, clean collar and black tie, always well shaved, and keep my teeth clean, We hold before our minds at all times that we are God’s ambassadors, and that we have the authority, and that he expects to use us to his name’s honor and glory. I started out in 1905 with the determination to make my calling and election sure and to advertise the King and the kingdom, whether the people hear or whether they forbear; and I try to keep before my mind at all times that I am not my own/’— B. G. Crawford, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Texaa.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">When you approach the people with the Studies in the Scriptures, it is well to have in mind the proper points; and this is manifest in a consideration shown those you are canvassing.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">“It is not so much the argument you put up as it is a willingness to do the Lord's work. I find </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">tha</span><span class="font1">t the less said, the quicker the sale. You can talk yourself in and talk yourself out so easily, as most people to whom we talk are of the world. Everybody should know a Catholic as soon as one comes to the door, and should not talk Bible or man of sin, I sold four Combinations to four Catholics straight in four homes.”—Joseph Perkins, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I went to a doctor’s home here, and had to go to the back door, as they were working on the front. The lady told me that she did not have time to talk to me, and that if I had something to sell she could not buy ; for she had just bought a $50.00 set of books on the Bible, and she had heard money until she was tired of it: that they had gone through such strenuous times, paying for their new church and piano ; and that their preacher had a loose screen on his window, and asked the church to send someone down to tack the screen back. Then I told her that I would take up only a few moments of her time, that I had some good news, advertising our new King and his kingdom, That attracted her attention. She asked, ‘Who is the King?’ I told her: ‘It is our dear Redeemer.’ Then she asked many questions and bought the Harp. She apologized for treating me so impolitely and invited me hack, saying that if I had something to sell ho cheap which told so many good things, she wanted it.”— E. R. Poe, Alo.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">“A woman, when she sees the books in my hand, says : ‘I don’t want to buy any books’; and she almost has shut the door before I Can utter a word. But quick I must be to say: ‘No, Madam; I don’t want to sell yon a book ; I want to bring you a message.* ”— Herman Franck, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pa,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Remarks that are aimed to obtain immediate interest not merely should be those of the spectacular, sort but should also seek to bold the interest created. In the examples afforded in the letters herewith, one colporteur emphasizes the fact that he has a message to give. The other gives a method that often overcomes the antagonism manifested when an agent disturbs people in their work.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">“We have found here that keeping the message constantly before the people, in other words repeatedly hammering away the same old thing ‘Millions Now Living Will Never Die,’ has awakened both interest and curiosity Our newspaper office manager after discussing with. If what these people preach is half as</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">which has developed into interest, our theme and methods concluded true as it sounds, they should charge $5.00 for admission to their meetings instead of admitting the public free.’’’“-Louis Gleekman, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">N.J,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The section in which we are working is a cotton belt, and at this time of the year money is scarcer than at any other time. The following is a record of the number of complete sets of 8 volumes which I have left on each of the days I have thus far canvassed for the $2.85 offer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“First day 4} sets, Second day 4 sets, Third day 3 sets, Fourth day 4 sets. Fifth day 2 sets. Sixth day 2 sets, Seventh day 3 sets, Eighth day 4 sets, Ninth day 3 sets, Tenth day 2 sets, Eleventh day 5 sets. Twelfth day 3 J sets, Thirteenth day 5 sets, Fourteenth day 3 sets, (half day) Fifteenth 3J sets, (half day). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“This section has been canvassed to death by book agents. Therefore as I approach the prospective buyer, realizing that he thinks. 'There comes another agent’ I generally try to pass some remark that pnts him in good humor and</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Acbzertise the FC I NIG and KINGDOM</span></h1>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">on n more confidential footing. If the party is on the porch or in the field and sees me approaching, as I come up my remark is often ; ‘I suppose yon think there conies another agent, and most agents are after your money, but I know you haven’t any, so T could not be after that.’ I try to feel and act as free and easy with each one I canvass as I would if I were talking to my relatives. If the prospect hesitates but gives evidence of being ready to buy. I simply pass a few remarks about the price of the books and try to close the sale. If the party does not show interest. I then point out some other features of the vol nine, showing how beautiful the style of reading is by reading ‘Close your eyes . . . ’ on page 191, Volume A.*'—F. H. Dougherty. Tenn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“In approaching the people I first attract their attention to the state of unrest and trouble upon the earth at the present time.”—Miss A. Billings, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">N. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“My methods of procedure vary with the individual addressed, Tf indifference or curiosity is shown, I wake them to attention by saying, ‘Do you know that the time is at hand for millions now living to live always on the earth and not die?’ They show the extent of their interest by a quickening nod, a look, a smile of ridicule or of interest, or disdain; but more often with, ‘How do you know?’ This is what I wait for.”—Anna E. Myers. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pa.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1">“I also meet some people that say they want nothing to do with Russell’s books or Ruswellism. If they have none of the books I offer to lend either the ‘Millions* booklet or the Harp, telling them that the bonk will point them the Scriptures that prove the statement that millions now living w’ill never die : and very often they will buy one or the other of the books. I have five books out now that T lent and have sold several sets tn people after allowing them to read one of the books. One lady had the full set of seven, but had not read them, because she had found out that. Pastor Russell was the author. I succeeded in selling her husband the Ha up. I laid out the whole eight volumes for one man to view’, telling him what they were: and he guessed the price fit $25.00. He would like to have the books, but could not spare so much money just now. But when, he learned ho could get them for $2.85. he soon produced the price.”—Chas. L. Galbreath. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pa.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1">In order that your remarks may appeal to the people, they should apply to things that exist today, and should demonstrate that what you have for the people applies to today’s problems and today’s life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“The only class I find opposed consists of those bound in Babylon : so I try to prevent this by explaining that the churches do not preach these things because founded long before the kingdom was at hand ; that Daniel, who prophesied of these days, was told he could not understand them till the ‘time of the end’. If they persist that they are Metho</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“T find that the people are much less prejudiced than I had expected to find them, and are much more willing to investigate the truth. It seems that the people in general think we are living in the time of the end, and I find it very appropriate to tell thorn how the prophecies in the 24th chapter of Matthew have been fulfilled.”—Mrs P. F. Arthur, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ga.</span></p>

This took well with all mothers I canvassed: and some would remark that they could learn from books as well as could children. I find it a little chilly getting into homes ; but many realize afterwards that my visit, was really a desire to bless them and theirs, apologize for being cool and uninterested in the beginning.

<p><span class="font1">“If the interest Is shown by asking questions, I answer one or two that can be explained very briefly, but refer them to the hooks for a clearer, better answer than what I could say : and besides, they would have the Bible references to use.”—Anna F.

<p><span class="font1">, “There are two ways in which a sale of books takes place: (1) After I have made the plan as clear as I possibly can, the majority of the people seem interested. I present the set first, telling them where to find the different parts of the plan they seem most interested in. I also stress the reasonableness of the price, telling of an incident where some one connected with the printing of books remarked upon the reasonableness. Thinking that by taking a set is the only way to hear more of the truth, those who are very interested take a set. (2) Tf while talking I find the person to whom I am talking is not interested, hut that any relative living at the same address might be, I make an appointment to call on a Sunday morning; and thus far have not failed to place a sot by this plan.

<p><span class="font1">“Many people, as I approach them, state that there is no use spending any time with them as they do not want any books. I pay no attention to these remarks hut proceeds to cajivass, with the result that their minds soon change and they want the set.

Have yon noticed that nations are looking for a leader like Lincoln but they admit they can find none?’ Questions like this usually bring a spark of interest to the face of the litener, and then, after completing as briefly as possible. I try to picture conditions as they will be shortly after for those who are carried over and through the time of trouble. Then I present the set. I carry only the Seventh Volume and the Harp.

Myers, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I often find that a desire for the books can he made by showing the list of Scripture citations in the hack of the books, telling them every important Scripture text is considered in these books, and they can look up those certain texts or their Sunday School lesson by means of this index, the right book being found by means of the general subject of the book. The question feature is another good point. I also show them the contents of the books under the general headings in the front of the book, and speak of the hooks as really a complete Bible Encyclopedia in that way, so as to be able to find any subject or text desired. People nowadays are so busy that they despair at the thought of wading through volumes to find an explanation of a text; and if it Is made simple to find, they w’?nt it.”—Mary J.

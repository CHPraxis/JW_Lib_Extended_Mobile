<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark1"></a>COLD OR HOT-WHICH?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Because thou art lukewarm, and neither-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">thee out of my mouth.”—Revelation 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font4">HE lesson taught by these words is that Jesus does not approve any one who is lukewarm concerning his cause. It is trije that the words apply primarily to the church nominal, but they announce a principle governing all who claim to be following Christ Jesus. He foresaw and foretold the conditions that would exist at the end of the age. He foretold that the cold and indifferent would be cast aside as of no value. The lukewarm likewise would be pushed away from him because these would constitute a hindrance in his battle against Satan’s organization. There could be no place in this conflict for the one who is trying to maintain an appearance for the Lord, but who really does nothing to represent his interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The very purpose of calling attention to these things is that some who have been more or less indifferent to the cause of Christ’s kingdom may arouse themselves and see the privilege of now participating in announcing the King and advertising his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>The Honor of the Victorious</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord’s second presence dates from 1874. From that time forward until 1914 was the time of his special preparation for his assault against Satan’s empire. August 1, 1914, the gentile times ended; and there the Lord began his ouster proceedings against the great evil one. There the battle between the beast and the Lamb really began. To truly appreciate what this battle means is all-sufficient to spur the true Christian into the thickest of the fight. Why? Because Jesus states that the victory will be his; that it is the final conflict between Satan and his forces and the Lord, and that Satan shall be completely overthrown; and that in the fight those with the Lord are the called and chosen ones, and those who remain loyal to him through the fight to the end will stand victorious with him when the warfare is completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be with Jesus in that great victory is a blessing and honor beyond description of words. Surely no cold one would be considered as having any part in that conflict. Surely no person who is lukewarm and fearful could be expected to be there. But those who do participate in that battle and rejoice in that victory will be those who recognize the Lord’s organization, who gladly put themselves under the direction and supervision of the Lord, anxious and willing to be used by him, and who with the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house press forward in the battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To which class do you belong, dear brethren? Each one must • decide that question for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This battle is not with carnal weapons, but it is fought with the sword of the spirit, which is mighty through Christ to the pulling down of the strongholds of error. It means that the message of truth must be given to the people; and that each of the zealous, heated ones will persist in giving that message forth day by day, seizing all opportunities to herald it until Satan’s forces are wasted.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Largest Force in Harvest’s History</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">For the encouragement of those who are now at the front, we take this occasion to say that there are at this time more colporteurs engaged in the sendee than at any time during the harvest of the past forty-five years: that there are more in the classes engaged in the work than at any time heretofore; that the line between workers and non-workers has been removed; and now it is the desire to class all as workers, and so let each one determine for himself whether or not he belongs to one or the other class. Let each one ask himself: Am I doing my part ?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“Literature in Every Home”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">We suggest that each member of the class and each colporteur jesnlve to put into the.hands of the people so many bv.ks week, and then strive to accomplish that; and if you gj ww it, so much the better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you are not in the active service, pray that the Lord may open the way for you quickly to engage in it. If you are engaged &gt;&nbsp;in it, pray the Lord that he will increase your strength and your ability, which means to fill you more with his spirit and thereby increase your opportunities of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The world has no remedy for its present ills. The Lord’s kingdom is the remedy. To his people are committed his interests of that kingdom, particularly at this time to make it known. With joyful hearts let each one do his or her part in making it known.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Announcement</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Society wishes to announce the publication of a new booklet : “World Distress—Why ? The Remedy.” It contains 64 pages, paper binding of imitation brown Morocco leather, gold stamped. It contains a treatise on each of the following subjects:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why is Evil Permitted? Who Made the Devil? Prophecy and Its Fulfilment End of the World Immortality Where Are the Dead? A Ransom for All</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">World Distress and Perplexity—Why ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Frequent quotations are made from the Studies in the Scriptures, giving the volume and page number where the subject is dealt with at length. The object of the booklet is to place in the hands of the people literature that will incite interest in the Studies in the Scriptures and emphasize the necessity of possessing tie entire set. Each article is complete in itself; the subjects </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">as </span><span class="font4">above enumerated are not chapter headings of the booklet. It permits an individual interested in any one subject to get a satisfactory answer to his question without having to read previous and succeeding chapters. The book is designed to retail at 10 cents per copy. Workers can carry the booklet with them as they canvass for The Harp of God, and when failing to place the Harp Course, they can offer this booklet at 10 cents a copy, suggesting that it contains the address of the local branch (which may be inserted) as well as the name and address of the publishers so that they might know where to procure further literature. Order of procedure and the use of the booklet are being outlined in more detail in the Directors’ Bulletin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">When you lack results In the sale of the literature, it is well to analyze the methods you are employing. Many times you will find that you are not supplying enough or the right information to permit the person canvassed to act intelligently. This is but another way of stating that they have not been presented with items of sufficient importance to make them desire to possess the book. Such an examination as suggested in the following letter will no doubt prove profitable:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“At first I thought that people did not appreciate the book. Then I began calling their attention to some questions on the quiz-card, emphasizing that these were not silly questions designed for a child, but sensible ones that every individual should be prepared to answer. Some time ago a lady told me that her boy could ask questions that a preacher could not answer. Oftentimes I mention this in connection with the questions.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Getting Expressions from Indifferent</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Indifference is probably one of the most difficult conditions with Rhich &lt;■.' f.;yr T, ct / ■ ■■ ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ ’’-tC ’ &gt;&nbsp;t ' I’i-s r£- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.3 fi,*-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>;</sup> i &lt;»’. •</span></p>

Oftentimes the pointed remark will give some clue to their indifference:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I had another experience: A woman was washing and for about fifteen or twenty minutes simply ignored me until I said something about the clergy not giving the truth. She stopped and said: ‘I have done with them.’ I said: Shake hands. I also have done with them long ago. She bought the books and thanked me for the talk we had, and will come to meeting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And in such instances when expressions are obtained from the parties canvassed, they should be dealt with seriously. Do not pass them by as though they are not of any consequence. They are real to the person expressing himself, and he holds to them so tenaciously that up until the time he spoke no clue was forthcoming. Now that some expression was made, it is best to talk along that line. The following case reported by a director was well handled by the worker:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A sister reaching a front door received no response, and then went to the rear door, where she was met in a pleasant manner. But as soon as the lady learned what the sister had, she said, she did not fill her mind with every idea that came along. In a little time the sister had her attention. The lady seemed to feel that shtf had sinned against the holy spirit, and having wrong conceptions was in deep sorrow. Our sister explained the matter, was then invited into the house, and was told that just that morning this woman had knelt down, asking the Lord to guide her and show her the way. The sister said that she was there with the truth in answer to her. prayer. The lady bought the Harp. A neighbor of this lady had been passed twice; but as a result of the conversation, the sister went </span><span class="font2">hack and found a ■ «.■?-• xj- of -'ow, •-'vidcntiy Mie work of</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Will Act According to Suggestion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Having selected your points with a view to causing people to desire the literature, the next step is to help them make the decision. At this point of the canvass your remarks should be such as to influence them to act favorably. Up to this point you have had to take the initiative; you have had to help them see how necessary the book is. Now you will have the further responsibility of helping them decide and decide favorably. Experience in the work will acquaint you with the various excuses that people make for not purchasing. These are not to be accepted, but to be overcome. In fact, they are depending upon you to overcome their objections, probably reasoning that if their pretext for not purchasing cannot be met decisively, then they have acted wisely in not purchasing. A worker properly feeling his responsibility will aim to place the books in their hands, knowing that he has the proper appreciation of their value to the individual; and that ultimately, if it were possible, he would be thanked for his efforts. There is much to be commended in the methods of the following colporteur:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“In canvassing the people we find they offer many excuses. One common excuse is : ‘I do not have time to read.’ I tell them : -Well, if you do not have time now, you may have later on ; ami then you would not have the opportunity of getting this special offer. Others in your home might find the books Interesting, too.’ I also tell them that if people realised the full value of these books they would </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">find</span><span class="font3"> time to read them. Some say they cannot read much, aud some not at all on account of having trouble with their eyes. I suggest that they have someone read these wonderful things to them, or that oven if they can only read a little now aud then they wiil have a blessing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you feel that you have presented the matter fully, supplying all the information necessary for an intelligent decision, you have good grounds upon which to expect people to purchase; and since you expect them to purchase, then help them to do so. Too often the worker feels that he is too aggressive, that he is seeking to make the people do something that they do not want to do; and desiring to have the approval of the persons canvassed, he begins to wonder what opinion they hold of him. He may feel that he is looked upon as an Intruder. Feeling this way, in a half apologetic manner, he is apt to withdraw in the most crucial part of the canvass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This desire for the approval of others is a human trait. Generally the person you are canvassing is beginning to wonder what you are thinking of him, and knows that since you will be canvassing from door to door you are Hlre’y to carry the opinion you hold to others. At this</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">VI TV ■ ii.v ■&gt;-,-■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,» ...,1 &lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ivif.Ei f.n nitn 10 &lt;10 is :&lt;&gt; purchase, that It is illogical not to purchase; and such remarks as tend to emphasize the importance of the work and the service it renders will help people. For instance, such remarks as made by the following worker:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“If a person expresses disbelief in the statement ‘Millions Now Living Will Never Die,’ I tell him that thousands of people are beginning to believe that now. Then I hold up the book and say: This little book has been off the press only a few months, has been translated into over twenty-seven different languages, and over 2,500,000 have been sold. I have sold a number of sets in that way. I mention this because I have been helped by suggestions from others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a poor policy to expect that people will purchase the books merely because these have been brought to their attention. It is showing proper respect and consideration for your prospect to feel that the matter must be properly and fully presented to obtain his approval. Oftentimes at this point it is advantageous to employ the methods of the following worker:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“My hobby is to cite them some prophecy which has been fulfilled, especially that of the great inventions, increase of knowledge, falling away of ilie clergy, their association with big business, etc. In this way I have been able to place several full sets of Scrictubk Studies, also sets of three.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Close at Propitious Time</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Having thus presented the entire matter, obtaining a decision is the next step. This, however, should not be attempted until you feel that doubts have been removed, and that the person has be«n accorded</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">O ' Ilf<sup>1</sup> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jp ,, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&lt; ■ tint. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>

Advantage should then be taken of the situation quickly to obtain a decision. Obviously the person is now concerned about the terms and conditions; and so to make the possession of the book appear to be an easy matter, methods such as the following colporteur employs are often necessary:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The sales, of course, are rather scarce, but we find in more places than we expected that the women who have had the Harp or other books now will buy tlie seven volumes on the installment plan, perhaps only one book at a time, selling milk aud butter or a few eggs to pay for them. But they have at last begun to read.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It may be wise, sometimes, to compare the value of the books with their cost, and attempt, if possible, to have the entire transaction closed upon delivery of the books. This is the preferable method, but the above emphasizes what accommodations the colporteur can make in order to meet the point of view of the person canvassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It should be remembered that once an adverse decision is given, it is hard to have it reversed. If the matter has been presented and the people give a reason why they do not wish to purchase tlie books, it is quite unlikely that they will be moved by further arguments. Hence it is well to see to it that they are given the information necessary to act favorably before asking for their decision. This can often be aecom-r' &nbsp;ed by testing whether the prospect is ready to purchase, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ion as soon as possible of sue<sup>1</sup>'. a; attitude as mentioned by the</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Assuring Yourself of Delivery</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Let us review for a moment the position of the prospect at the point you are asking him to decide to purchase the book. First, in all probability he had never before heard of the book you are selling and what he now knows is only what you have told. A good question, then, is whether you have fully represented the book, whether the prospect in saying that he does not want it was acting intelligently, with the full facts of the value and service of the book before him. If you feel that this has not been done, then supply him whatever further information he may lack to permit a favorable decision. Everyone wants to possess a thing of value. To most people it would be a mark of poor judgment to pass by a proposition that will benefit them. So as long as they manifest interest, your remarks should be aimed to develop this interest. Many times they have been convinced gradually, and the excuses they advance are in reality given to have you bring forth additional talking points. Thus you should always have in reserve additional features about the book that you have not mentioned, enlarging its field of usefuless, and emphasizing its great value.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark1"></a>VALIANT WARRIORS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“And take the helmet of sa.lvatwn and the, sword of the spirit, which is the. word of God.'”—Ephesians</span><span class="font2"> 6:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The text shows plainly that it applies to the church, and the context shows that the time of application is at the end of the Gospel age and near the end of the earthly journey of the church. Prophetically St. Paul looked down to the time when there would be a great falling away from the faith by those who claimed to be followers of Christ Jesus. The facts now apparent exactly fit the words of the prophecy. Even, among ourselves there are some who have claimed to he following the Lord and feeding at his table and have now turned aside to partake of another table, denying the .presence of the Lord and the time of the harvest and the cud of the world. But a greater falling away is manifested amongst the masses of nominal Christianity. The Modernists openly repudiate the Bible as the inspired Word of God, arid deny the blood of Jesus, by which mankind is purchased. There is also a great army of those who in a measure hold to the Bible, believing it to be God’s inspired Word, and who believe that Jesus is the Redeemer; yet they are floundering about, not knowing which way to go. They call themselves Fundamentalists because they believe some of the fundamentals of God’s Word. Their shepherds have permitted them to starve for<sup>1</sup> want of an understanding of that Word.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Strengthen Wavering Faith</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">What a wonderful opportunity now presents itself to the fully consecrated Christians, who possess the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. Such see more plainly than ever the need for the helmet of salvation; that is to say, for a knowledge of the divine plan, both an intellectual understanding and a heart appreciation of it. These also see the great necessity of aiding the honest Fundamentalists to get a better understanding of God’s Word. Such desire to enable seekers for truth to put on and keep on the helment of salvation. Now the opportunity is here to render such help. With the opportunity comes responsibility. Duty now calls the consecrated and loving zeal prompts him to put forth every effort to give the message of the kingdom to those who have a hearing ear. Such zeal is like lire in the Christian’s bones, compelling him to go forth with the message of truth and salvation to his neighbor.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Creed Errors Not Bible Truths</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Again the words of the inspired Apostle to the consecrated ring out: “Take the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.” The sword is an instrument of warfare. With it the Christian defends himself from the attacks of the adversary. With it he also assaults the great errors put forth by the adversary, thereby doing his part to batter down the strongholds of error that the people might see and understand and be relieved from the blinding influence of the adversary. The Lord has sent forth his ambassadors with instruction to use the sword of the spirit as valiant soldiers under the great Captain who is leading his army to certain victory. Now is the time in which every true and faithful follower of Christ Jesus must wield the sw<sup>r</sup>ord of the spirit.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Where Life and Happiness Are Found</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Let each consecrated one ask himself or herself, Am I a member of the Lord’s army ? If so, what am I doing in the great battle for truth? If the Lord has given you the opportunity to use the sword of the spirit, then hasten to avail yourself of that opportunity and do so. Wield the sword deftly and lovingly, yet with a firm hand. Hasten to the honest Fundamentalist and help him to get on the helmet of salvation by giving to him an understanding of the great plan of salvation. Lioubtless there is yet a great multitude of those who believe the Bible insofar as they understand it and who are anxious to have a clearer understanding of it. These have been blinded by the instruments of the adversary, by his dumb dogs, who cannot themselves bark, but who prevent others from having an understanding. Conditions are now shaping to separate all the honest-hearted ones from those who name the name of Christ and yet deny his saving power. The only class of people on earth who are armed with the weapons of warfare, who have on the armor of God, are those who now have a clear understanding of the divine plan of salvation as set. forth in the publications of the Society.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Possessors of Only Aid</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Thus the Lord has aimed each one of his faithful followers with the sword of the spirit and laid upon such the obligation of using it to his glory. Let all such, therefore, quit themselves like men. Be valiant soldiers in the army of the Lord. Perfect love makes bold the Christian in the day of judgment. We are now in that day. Therefore gird on the armor and go forth to battle. Let all who appreciate the opportunities joyfully participate in the service of the Lord. Let each one in Zion say to his brother, as ye go forth: “Let uot your hand be slack.” The joy of the Lord ia our strength.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Proclamation for Distribution</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The Resolution passed at the Los Angeles Convention has been prepared for distribution in tract form. It brings to the attention of Christians the attempt of the Modernists to disregard the Word of the Lord, and calls upon Fundamentalists to align themselves with the Ixird's Word. It sets forth conditions prevalent among Christians today, To obtain the help that they require, they should be acquainted with the truth as contained, in the Studies in the Scki^tukes. The tract emphasizes the necessity of taking a stand; and while the people are in this attitude, the workers’ opportunity is to aid them to come to a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the “Letter of Instructions to Directors’’ the method of procedure has been outlined. We urge workers to follow up the distribution quickly with the eight-vohime otter, not permitting the distribution to interfere with the workers’ canvassing tor the eightvolume set; and so soon as these tracts are available to attempt to put forth as much effort as possible to reach the Fundainejdalists while the matter is prominent in their minds. Possibly the distribution can he token care of by some not able to get, out in actual canvassing or by distributions Sunday mornings, it possible, this distgbution to prepare territory for canvassers to work in during the Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">October 31st has been set as the date for conceited effort in diss' trihution, to be followed by a thorough canvass of the territory in which the tracts were distributed with the complete set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May the Lord bestow his strength and grace as yon seek to reach those people who cleave to his Word, arid as you endeavor to aid them to see the Lord’s plan and providence on their behalf, thus stimulating their t'aitli and confidence in his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With Christian greetings, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brethren and servants in the lx&gt;rd.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

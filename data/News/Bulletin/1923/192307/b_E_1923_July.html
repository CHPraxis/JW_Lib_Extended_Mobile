<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark1"></a>ARE YOU ON THE LORD’S SIDE ?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.&quot;—Luke</span><span class="font4"> 11: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I</span><span class="font4">T must now be apparent to every consecrated child of God that Satan, the great opposer, has a powerful organization for evil. It must also be clearly seen by all such that the Lord has an organization for good. One stands for everything that is evil. The other stands for everything that is righteous. The Lord himself is at the head of his organization, to judge and to make war. (Revelation 19 :11) His armies are following after him, one division beyond the vail, one division on the earth. “Out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword.” This is the instrument of warfare, the message of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord fortold this final conflict between the beast, the devil’s organization, and the Lamb. Counted in with the Lamb, as members of his organization and therefore of his army, are the called, chosen and faithful ones. The words of Jesus clearly lay down the rule that between the two organizations there is no middle ground that any one can justly take. In this final conflict of truth versus error Jesus says: “He that is not with me is against me.” He must of necessity be on one side or the other. Let each consecrated child of God, then, ask himself now: Am I on the Lord’s side; and am I uncompromisingly devoting myself to his cause? Am I faithfully looking to the interests of my King?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This self-examination concerning the matters of the kingdom is now eminently proper. Each one should do this for his own welfare. Then again Jesus says: “He that gathereth not with me scattereth.” Necessarily those words mean that any who would content himself with idly folding his hands and doing nothing, or with standing aloof and complimenting himself upon his own righteous course, must be and is classed by the Lord with those that scatter. If we recognize what is the Lord’s cause and what is his work, then we must choose to put ourselves in one or the other classes mentioned by the Lord himself. A passive attitude of doing nothing puts one in the class against the Lord; for he says so.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Activity Means Spiritual Growth</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">It is no wonder, then, that the Apostle wrote to the church: “ Be not slothful in business [the King’s business] ; but fervent [heated] in spirit, serving the Lord.” (Romans 18:11) “And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end.” (Hebrews 6:11) Whosoever is fearful and afraid, indifferent or lukewarm, of neccessity puts himself into one class. Whosoever has perfect love in his heart for the Lord and that zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house will have boldness in this day. (1 John 4:17) It is a happy and joyful service now because the King is leading and victory is with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No one Christian can judge another; but the Lord has made these things clear in his Word that each one can examine and judge himself. Some may be so situated that they cannot actively engage in the service because of conditions over which they have no control, but these may find time in the evenings or at their door, or on other occasions, to do something to advertise the King and his kingdom. Let each one, then, do with his might what his hands find to do, and do it with rejoicing.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Great Demand for the Message</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">From all portions of the field (throughout the earth) come reports of increased interest of the people in the message of the kingdom. Never before has been such a demand for the message of truth as published by the Society. And why should it not be thus! The church nominal has been completely spued out of the Lord’s mouth. .No longer have the nominal clergy any food upon which the hungry souls can be fed. These unfaithful shepherds of the flock have abandoned them to starve and to the ravages of the evil one. Many of the weaker ones are turning to spiritism, and otherwise falling under the baneful influence of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord is using his faithful followers to gather unto him those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, and has commissioned his faithful servants to carry to the hungry ones his message of reconciliation and comfort. He that gathers with the Lord is on the Lord’s side. Happy is his lot.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Announcement</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">The Society wishes to announce that shortly after June 1st the Studies in the Scriptures will be supplied in a new binding, which we believe will prove more attractive to the people than the present binding. The books will be bound in a different kind of cloth, of a deeper maroon than the present edition of Studies in the Scriptures. The backbone stamping of the book contains, in addition to that appearing in the present binding, the title of the volume. The front cover design contains the title of the volume, and in the place of the inscription, “A Helping Hand for Bible Students,” there has been substituted the inscription, “The Way to Life and Happiness.” The Scripture Index appearing in the back of each volume has been consolidated and is contained in Volume 1, This enables those possessing the set of volumes to locate in the entire set without referring to the individual indexes scripture that is either explained or quoted. Thus as a question is advanced, one can step to his bookcase, take from the shelf the first volume, locate the scripture citation in the index and find where the text is explained. The index includes a complete Scripture Index of Volume 7, Studies in the Scriptures, which heretofore was not contained in the book. We trust, too, that the use of Volume 1 will emphasize the necessity of purchasing the other volumes, as no doubt some people will purchase only Volume 1; and as they refer to the index, the importance of possessing the other volumes will be emphasized with each reference. We expect that the Studies in the Scriptures in the old binding will be permanently out of stock soon, with the exception of such supplies as may be on hand at some of the larger classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By his grace we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your fellow servants in the Anointed One,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>METHODS OF WORK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">There Is quite a distinction between being overbearing and being persistent. Courteous, considerate persistency which manifests a feeling on the part of the worker that perhaps he has not fully presented the matter, and that he is anxious to be of real service, will often bring from the person canvassed questions or remarks that will manifest what further steps you should take in supplying the necessary information for him to act favorably. Looking at what you have said from the prospect’s point of view v. ill often bring a decision from the hesitating, almost persuaded individual. Regardless of what efforts he has put forth to accomplish a sale, the pains he has taken to place a book, the worker is never justified in making cutting remarks to the person he is canvassing. The courtesy displayed by the colporteur writing us as follows accomplished what he desired, namely, the placing of the books, even though he may have been compelled to experience some hurt feelings:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Sold the set of seven, Harp, and Scenario to a man with whom I was working; and I believe that he will take the Reprints, G. A., and the Watch Tower. One of our neighbors who had bought a Harf from Sister B----</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">afterward ordered the regular colporteur to leave his door. He said that he knew more Bible than all the Bible Students put together. This man and his wife are studious. When they can get no solution of their own, they send over to see what we think about it. He sent his wife over to see if we could explain 1 Timothy 3 : 1G ; and we sent Volume 5. Now he wants the entire set of seven volumes. The truth, with kindness, does the work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In asking for a decision, then, do not be too easily moved by the excuses the people offer. In short, do not abandon too quickly the efforts you have so far put forth; for oftentimes a few additional remarks, fewer by far, perhaps, than the whole of what you have said thus far, will result in a sale. Forceful suggestions that tend to incite action generally prove to be an excellent way of obtaining results; for instance, such a suggestion as “Keep this book and start your reading tonight” is more likely to induce favorable action than the question, “Wouldn’t you like to have a copy?” In the first instance you make a suggestion that carries with it a decision, and in the second instance you are asking them to decide; and it appears to them that the reason you do this is that you really are not sure what decision they should make.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Tactfulness with Zeal</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Honest dealing and frankness must always be manifested in the attitude of the worker; in fact, this spirit should permeate your entire canvass. If any act or word, no matter how unconsciously, hints at trickery or misrepresentation, your sale is lost. Unfortunately opinions of this sort are very seldom expressed, and consequently It is for the worker to watch his words and actions to see that nothing In them warrants an opinion of this character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Again, to suggest that they order because one of their neighbors has ordered is to approach them along wrong lines; for people like to feel that what they are doing is original in themselves. Therefore they often resent the suggestion that they should do a certain thing because one of their neighbors has done it, that they should be governed by what other people do. Still they place confidence in your work because of the way it has been received by others. A tactful method of meeting this situation is suggested In the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Immediately upon giving my canvass I open my little note-book with names of people who have already purchased. This works just as the signing or the petition did for the brethren. Some people will note with interest the <sup>a</sup>!!' remark, ‘Mrs.— is Catholic’ or ‘Methodist.’ I try to remember <sup>eas</sup>?J<sup>y ; alld ln many cases Jt</sup> removes questions out buvinc tbS ™<sup>ure the that there 18 1,0</sup> obligation to them in * books.

Of where ’ a^nuinb'er n’r'hSl <sup>ab</sup>°<sub>h</sub><sup>Ve</sup> “ <sup>S</sup>.3.°<sup>d perhaps</sup> only in a small town wuere a number of books has been sold.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Get the Books into People’s Hands</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">A canvass or representation may be then considered as having seven principal parts, namely:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Canvass</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Appeal</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Approach</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Attention</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Desire</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Decision</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Confidence</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Reinforce your Original Canvass</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">If the order has been taken, there is still work to be done by the worker: for sometimes after you have left, the people begin to reconsider what they have done. They question whether they have acted wisely In purchasing the book. The financial obligations that they are already under impress themselves upon their mind, and they begin to conclude that they should not have ordered the book; and in talking the matter over with the wife, they feel justified in refusing the book when it is delivered. To be sure, you advance many reasons why they should purchase; but now these reasons do not seem so important since you are not there to emphasize them. Such an attitude means that when you come to deliver the books you must spend almost the same amount of time as at the first to re-canvass them, and you may be unsuccessful in delivering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Or, in instances where the book has been sold outright, they lay it aside and do not read it. The interest that was once alive they themselves have killed. An example of this is given in the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“A lady who is a member of the Plymouth Brethren Church, when first</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I canvassed her wanted to sell me six volumes of Studies in the Scriptures because she said, they are no good. I informed her that 1 would be doing her a &quot;rear injustice if I bought them. I made a second call, and left a Harp at the&quot; home. The family are taking the course, and are well pleased with my explanation of Scripture texts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The canvass is for the purpose of convincing the people of the necessity and the value of the book. They themselves were convinced that they should have the book; but now that you have left they are trying to single out some good reason that they might give to their friends or family in defence of their action, and a worker will find it to his advantage to use a little time after having taken the order to supply these reasons to the persons he has canvassed. It helps them to feel satisfied with their purchase, and in a case where the order is to be delivered later, they will be looking forward to using the book in some such manner as you have suggested. At this juncture it is well to emphasize the small cost of the book in contrast with its quality-dull finish paper that does not hurt the eyes when reading as does paper with a glossy surface, the gold stamping, the good, sustantial binding, etc., and any remarks such as the following advances a satisfactory explanation as to why they are receiving books of such good value at such a low price:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“I explain that the reason why the books can be sold at such a reasonable rate is that Christian people of means are contributing to the Society ; that we own our own presses, book-bindery and that we do such a large volume of business.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another method is to demonstrate the facility of the Scripture Text Index, showing them how they can step to their bookcase and, taking one of the books, locate any scripture and find the explanation of the passage in the book. For instance, if you are using arguments along the lines of present-day events you can single out a scripture on today’s conditions and then advise them that this is dealt with in Volume —, Page —, but do not satisfy their curiosity by reading the comment in the volume. Rather lead them forward to using the book just as you have demonstrated. Always leave in their mind some question that has not been settled. Then they will look forward to using the book; and instead of thinking of excuses as to why they should not take the set when you deliver, they will plan ways and means to take the books and to use them when delivery is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No one of these points can be singled out as the all-important one. The canvass must progress from one point to the other, always keeping in mind the person you are addressing, the prospect, and how you as the colporteur or worker should conduct yourself, and the object of your call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Probably the thing which is most frequently lost sight of is the object of the call. Too often is the opinion held that it is not a matter of how many books you sell, but a matter of how many people to whom you witness the truth. This attitude is right and wrong. In the first place, the chief object is to place the literature In the hands of the people; for the literature will accomplish more than any remarks that you can make. The books leave them something with which to prove their new viewpoint and give something for the future reference. The principal object, then, is to place the books in their hands and let the books and literature do the talking and witnessing. Nor do we wish to be understood as saying that the employment of methods mentioned in the past few Bulletins means that any colporteur or worker by using these methods will always accomplish a sale. This cannot be expected. But it is certain more people will buy when a proper representation is made than when a poor and improper one is made. After all, we wish to get the literature into the hands of the people; for it will be of great use to them in the darkest period of the trouble, when all human agencies have failed. They can then find some comfort in the books which you have placed in their hands. Thus you can always keep before you the object of your work. Frame your remarks so as to incite interest of the people in the literature. Point them continually to the books for the answers to their queries; and you will then more completely realize the purpose of your service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>I. B. S. A. Week</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">August 19 to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">25</span><span class="font1"> inclusive will bd known among Bible Students as I. B. S. A. Week. During this week a concerted effort will be put forward by Bible Students throughout the entire world to bring to the attention of the people the work of the International Bible Students Association as to the distribution of literature among the people in every land and all languages, the meetings that it &gt;s holding, and the message that it is heralding forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1922 saw a great witness in the large convention held at Cedar Point. Since there will be no large general convention this year, an effort to draw the attention of the people of the world to the work of the I. B. S. A. will be made by the workers going forth, canvassing for the I. B. S. A. literature. The principal canvass will be for the full set of Studies in the Scbiptubes and the Harp of God at $2.85. More will be accomplished by canvassing for the eight books than by canvassing for the Harp of God alone. You will be enabled to place more sets of Studies in the Scriptures in this manner. But if you fail to place the set, then canvass them for the Habp ; and if you are still unsuccessful in placing the literature, offer the 10 cent booklet—• “World Distress— Why? The Remedy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Supplies have been shipped to all classes preparatory for this work. We do not mean that efforts to place the books are to be postponed until I. B. S. A. Week. You may proceed immediately to dispose of the supplies sent you; and if you are in a position to dispose of an additional supply, we shall be glad to extend such further credit as may be neccessary to fully equip you with the literature for that week’s work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">~ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUGUST 1, 1923</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>REPRESENTING THE KING</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Nov; then we are ambassadors for Christmas though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.&quot;—</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Corinthians 5</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A N AMBASSADOR is one who represents the king or ruler. Z-X His is a most honorable position. Every spirit-begotten and *■ anointed- Christian is by reason thereof the ambassador of Christ. He represents-the King; of glory. No person in this world ever held so honorable a position. Brother Russell once wrdte: “The English ambassador at Washington receives a salary of $60,000 per year, equivalent to more than $20 per hour. As ambassadors of the King of kings we hold a still more dignified position; and our time, from God’s standpoint, is worth .still more.” How true that, statement! The value to oneself of honest and faithful service unto the Lqrd cannot be measured by money. Ambassadors for earthly kings labor for a substance that soon loses its value. Those who represent the now tumbling thrones of Europe realize this. But lie who works in the cause of the Lord labors“iiot for the meat which perisheth, but for th.at meat which endureth unto everlasting life.” (John 6:27) What a blessed privilege, then, to he the ambassador of the King of glory!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Rewards that Benefit Both</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Tine, the tangible compensation for the present is small, yet the Lord secs to it that those who labor in his cause suffer not for bread. (Psalm 37 :2b) He knows what things we have need of, and graciously provides every need. But there are present rewards. Amongst these is the joy of the Lord that comes to one who serves for love. To know that you represent the King of kings : that his kingdom is now being set up, and that you have a part in making that known ; that this blessed kingdom of righteousness will undo all that the wicked one has done and will bring lasting relief to the people who for ages have been groaning and travailing in pain, waiting for this blessed kingdom: to carry this message of salvation and comfort to the hungry souls and see their countenance light tip with hope— all these things bring real joy to the heart.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark7"></a>But a Foretaste &quot;</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">, Then by faith look a little further on, when the ambassador^ change to glory comes, when the laborious part of the service here has ceased and the work of love goes on in the presence of the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By faith look forward to the multitudes of earth having the burden lifted from their shoulder's, the eyes of their understanding opened, the deaf ears unstopped; and behold the hosts long silent in death awakening and coining unto the temple of God with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads. This picture, which soon will be a reality, brings real joy to the heart. Then look higher still to the time when the ambassadors shall stand in the presence of Jehovah, beholding his loving countenance, him who in love has planned it all. And behold the glory and beauty of the Lord Jesus, who in love has executed that plan ; and then remember that standing in his presence will be fulness of joy, and that at his right band will be pleasures for evermore.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Working for Position in Spiritual Phase</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Can such boundless ricbes be measured by any or all of the wealth of earth? No, indeed! All such is but dross. Blessed, then, is the position of the ambassador of Christ who now, prompted by loving devotion to his Lord and King, renders joyful service, thereby laying up treasures unto eternal life. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Out</span><span class="font3"> Lord and Master would have Us now fey faith see some of these riches to come, that we might be fed as new creatures and strengthened in hope as we seek to faithfully represent his interests here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each day every colporteur, every class worker should go forth to the service with increased joy, singing in his or her heart: “The Lord is my strength and song. Gladly will I represent my King.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Points for Canvass</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">Good Morning!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Do you expect to be one of the 'millions now living who will never die’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You would like to live ca earth forever, wouldn’t you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is a way to life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">.Christians of all denominations have prayed for this time; “Thy kingdom \ come; thy will be done on e-a-r-t-h.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Bible foretells the world conditions that will mark this time as “a time of trouble such as has not been since there was a nation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The world is in distress. From the affairs of the nations to the door of every household there is sorrow and perplexity. It grows worse daily. The statesmen and leaders have lost control, and this world distress is identified as the time spoken of by Jesus : “Upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity, men’s hearts failing them for fear, looking after the things that are coming upon the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Big business is oppressing the people; politicians seem to be in league; the clergy have lost faith in God's Word and are turning to higher criticism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is no way to life and happiness under present conditions; for happi-. ness is over marred by sorrow, pain, and trouble and d-e-a-t-h.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You are living in the greatest period of the world’s history—the transition period. This evil world is being ushered Ont. God is establishing his kingdom. You may be one of those favored individuals who will never die. You may live through this trouble. The Bihle mentions this class, saying that they are those who are seeking to know rightousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God’s Word, the Bible, tells of God’s plan for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The International Bible Students Association is seeking to help people to understand God’s I’bin and is offering a library of eight topically arranged Bible Study Books written in ordinary, not theological, language. With the help of these volumes yon arc able to answer such questions as: Is there any significance in the present-day breaking np of kingdoms and empires and republics?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To what catastrophe does prophecy .indicate conditions and events are , leading? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How was it known thirtj<sup>7</sup> years before that the end of the tvorld would begin in 1914? (Hand the prospect card 345-358 to glance at as you proceed) .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You can look into scriptures and prophecies that are obscure. You can have an explanation of any text in the Bible ; for this complete index locates where the scriptures are explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Habp Bible Study Cotuise has heen included in this library of eight volumes. Weekly reading assignments are mailed and a selfniuiz card. You don’t submit written answers; the cards help, as you read to watch for the important items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/’</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>METHODS OF WORK</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">I. B. S. A. Week, August 19th to 20th inclusive, will have as its special object canvassing for the sale of the seven volumes of </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in The Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Harp Bible Study Course</span><span class="font2"> for $2.85, ending the week’s work with the public meeting August 26, subject for which is to be “All Nations Marching to Armageddon—but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Millions</span><span class="font2"> mm </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">living will never die.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work done with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Habp</span><span class="font2"> has located many people who are interested in the I. H. S. A. publications, many who arc extremely sympathetic with the presentations in our literature, and who, when pressed for a reply as to their views on religious matters, frankly state that the I. B. S. A. gives us the most reasonable explanation of present-day conditions. This interest on the part of the people has been accomplished by the work in the field. Looking back two or three years, no doubt every class can remember the opposition to its work: but by their service in the field the Lord’s people have overcome or broken this opposition by persistently telling the truth. People are desirous of learning the International Bible Students Association’s view upon religious subjects; and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> provide them with a complete library on every subject of importance to the people of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recognizing this attitude, the recommendation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Society</span><span class="font2"> is that from henceforth the principal canvass be for the eight volumes. Hailing to place the entire set, canvass for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Harp Bible Study Course;</span><span class="font2"> and failing to place the </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Harp Bible Study Course,</span><span class="font2"> then canvass for the booklet “World Distress—Why? The Remedy.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Experiment to Demonstrate</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">Feeling that probably the experience of the colporteur might be duplicated with the class workers, we submit here our correspondence with n number of colporteurs. When the eight volumes at the price of $2.85 were first announced, many colporteurs began canvassing for this offer immediately and enjoyed marked success. Others hesitated; and to these particulnr ones we wrote the following letter;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“In checking over your reports we. note that you have not disposed of full sets of Stupieb in the Scriptures and the Harc or Goo. We are wondering whether you have tried ont this offer, and if so, with what success. The reports of colporteurs who are working with the full sets of Studies in the Scriptures indicate that there is quite a large field for disposing of these books. We are certain that you would be successful in placing more literature In the hands of those you canvass if you present the full set of Studies in the Scriptures to them first; and then if unsuccessful in placing these, canvass them for the TTaiic Bible Study Course, or booklets. Ultimately people will purchase the full set of Studies in the Scriptures; and we are certain that the time is here when the majority of them will take advantage of the offer that you bring to their attention. We would like to have you try canvassing for the full set for a few days. It may be that you will not place so many full sets as you expect; but we are certain that you will place more than when canvassing merely for the Harp op God. Then, too we are certain that the canvassing for the full set will not influence in the least </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">xaur sWsiesELin t</span><span class="font0">he Harp or Hw booklets. The experiment, we believe, .____ <sup>(</sup> '.A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to-tM&gt;arty1yd fexjvoiy whether yonr</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The following are a few of the replies we have received:</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Sets Placed Where Harps Only Would Have Been Sold</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">“In reply to your letter of recent date will say that when I first entered into the work in Medina, N. Y„ I tried the canvassing with the complete set of Volumes together with the Harp and found that I did not have very much if any success with them. And as I thought perhaps it would be better to get one rutlior than uone at all into the hands of the reading people of Medina, 1 used the Harp and found that I did fairly well with it although prejudice seems to be great in the city. They certainly do not wish to know of the great King and his wonderful kingdom which is soon to be established. But on receipt of your letter I thought I would at least give your suggestion a fair trial, and so on Friday ruoruing, the day 1 received your letter, started out. Though I did not do a rushing business, still in three hours after starting I had received two Orders for the complete set. Including the Harp. In the afternoon I was unsuccessful, but the dear Lord gave me the privilege of leaving the message with one here aud there, for which I was truly thankful. I will continue canvassing with the complete set of volumes, and wish to thank you for your many suggestions which have been a decided help to me ill the work.&quot;—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jennie M. Casbohm, A. I’.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Proved Capable of Greater Work</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0">&quot;An honest confession is good for the soul. I must coufess I did not canvass for the Stcdies. I thought that I could not; it looked too big a thing for me to do. Last Friday I made up my mind that i would try canvassing for the Studies, and I sold two sets and eight Hari's; so I felt greatly encouraged. Then when I received your letter 1 was determined to do as'l was advised ; and I went out the next morning, and sold four full sets in three hours. Believe me, I was not trying to do </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font0"> way, but I felt bo weak and incompetent that I didn’t think I could sell Scripture Studies ; but </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">I learned my lesson</span><span class="font0"> well. If’fre give ourselves wholly over to the Lord and let his will be done with no thought of self, he can do wonderful things.”—Jfrs, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Carrie C.

I rejoice to say that on this same date I started to canvass for the complete set with Haul* Course, and to my surprise have the promise of four sets in the near future, one already promised tor July 1st. It seems really easier to canvass for the complete set than for the Combination ; at least that is the way Is seems so far,” —J/rs, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bessie Browning, G-a.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">“In answer to your letter of June 21st, will'state that the first day I canvassed for the set of Studies in the Scriptures I met with no success : but on the second day that I canvassed. I took orders for four sets and several Harpe. The following day I took an order for one set, but sold Keven Harps.

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>“I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ . . . preach the word: be<sup>j</sup>instant in season, out</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>of season'’—2 Timothy 4:1, 2:</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">S</span><span class="font2">T. PAUL wrote these words to Timothy because Timothy had made a covenant with the Lord to do his holy will; hence an obligation was laid upon Timothy which St. Paul desired him to fulfill. The spirit of the Lord God was upon Timothy because the Lord had anointed him to preach the good tidings unto the teachable. What Timothy was to do could bring no profit to the Lord, but the importance to Timothy is foreshadowed by the positive and serious words St. Paul uses. Solemnly he says: “I adjure you [I most solemnly urge upon you] before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, that you preach the word; be instant in season and out of season”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Applicable Now</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">What was true then is now true. The times in which Christians are now living have intensified the importance of following this admonition. Let each one ask himself these questions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Am I consecrated to the Lord? Did I agree to do God’s holy will? If so, then the words spoken to Timothy apply to me. God’s will concerning me is even my sanctification, my complete setting aside to do his will. As a new creature I am anointed with the holy spirit. My hope is ultimately to be a member of the royal family of heaven. I know thati I must prove my loyalty and faithfulness, and I desire to have just such experiences as,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the Lord wants me to have to make such proof. The Christian who thus reasons reasons properly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to what has been said, each spirit-begotten and anointed one is the ambassador of Christ, to whom has been delivered the Lord’s message of reconciliation to man. To each of his ambassadors the Lord through St. Paul no» says:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>“Preach the Word”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The w<sup>r</sup>ord is God’s message of reconciliation. To preach means to proclaim to others that message. Preaching may be by word of mouth or by placing the printed message in the hands of others. To be a witness for the Lord is preaching, whether by word or action. Some who are consecrated will say: ‘I cannot preach. I am weak. 1 am but a child. Let some one else do it.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord knew that such would be the sentiment of some hearts. He foreshadowed it through the experience of Jeremiah. Israel had turned away from God. Jeremiah was directed to go and preach to that nation, warning them of God’s vengeance and telling them what God’s blessings would be if they repented and served him. Jeremiah then was but a stripling, and he said to the Lord: “Ah, Lord God! Behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child. But the Lord said unto me’ Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. • Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord. Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.”—Jer. 1:6-8, 17.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Our Commission Now</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> As </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Theirs Then</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">“Now all these things happened unto Israel for ensamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world ' are come.” (1 Corinthians 10:11) Israel represented Christendom, in which there are many who desire to hear the word of God. Jeremiah the prophet foreshadowed the true,' consecrated representatives of the Lord in the earth. Jeremiah was commanded to preach to the people of the Impending disaster and the blessings that would follow repentance and obedience. The church, the ’ antitypical Jeremiah class, Is now commanded to preach the word of God, announcing God’s vengeance upon Satan’s empire In all of its parts, which message is coiitained In the Studies jn the Scbiptubes, and particularly Volume 7. They are to participate in the judgment of the demons, which message Is contained in the book “Can the Living Talk with the Dead?” They are commanded to preach the message that will bind up the broken-hearted and comfort those that mourn, which message is contained In the “Millions” book and more fully set forth in “The Harp of God”. Thus the time is here. &lt;&nbsp;The Lord will have the message given. He has provided us with the message. The obligation is upon all those anointed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>“In Season and Out of Season”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Remember the time is short. If we do not avail ourselves of the opportunity, the Lord will raise up somebody else; and thus we shall. miss the privilege. It is for our own welfare and spiritual development that we seize the opportunity now. Those who enter this door of opportunity joyfully will be thrice blessed. They will bless themselves ; bless the Lord, by singing his praises; and be a blessing to their hearers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are to preach the word when the Lord opens'the way for us. It may be out of season to us. One might be tempted to say: ‘I am tired. I prefer to take a vacation or a . holiday. I desire to spend the time in some pleasure or reading something that will (jive me pleasure.’ Let such remember that it is the chief business of our lives to be witnesses for the Lord and that no opportunity for service must be laid aside. Then we should act in season for those who wish to hear; and both in season and out of season for ourselves, as the Lord may open the door.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>God’s Purpose in Revealing Truth</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">There is scarcely a pulpit in all of Christendom where the truth of God’s word is spoken. The mass of the people are starving to death for the want of spiritual food. Their minds are filled with doubt and fear, and their hearts are sorrowful indeed. It behooves every one of the consecrated to heed this admonition of the Apostle, avail themselves of the glorious privilege, and hurry into the field with greater energy than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From all quarters come messages of good cheer from those who have recently heard the truth. In. a recent convention, amongst those that were immersed five announced that their reading of the truth had been confined to the reading of “The Harp of God”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Anticipate Effect'of Experiences</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Satan through his agencies will attempt to discourage you, and you may have some experiences that will make you feel like Jeremiah when he said: “I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name”. But every one who has the spirit of the Lord and who appreciates the wonderful time in which we are now permitted to be witnesses for him, will at once take courage; and like Jeremiah, say: “But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay”.—Jeremiah 20:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hurry into the field now. Fulfill your obligation as laid upon you by the Lord. Be a faithful and true witness, an honor and glory to his. name, and a blessing to those who have the hearing ear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Felicities of a Colporteur's Life</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">“I am sure that this is the best branch of the service. It has many advantages over the pilgrim service and is just as important. We have good meals and the most happy home life one could imagine. We assemble at night and talk over the experiences of the day, and also the Scriptures and Tower articles. Then the dear Lord has made providences so manifest in our behalf that our hearts are filled with gladness all the time. This is really the greatest life I have ever led. When we go out during the day and meet people, in distress, many of them, and see how the Master has arranged our lives so that we not only have an abundance of the good things of this life, but also have his holy spirit and his precious truth, then I say </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">it is a life, worth living.</span><span class="font0"> This has Jong bpen my desire, but I have liefer been able to attain it before. We have just enough of the vari-ous kinds of work to make it interesting. We lecture quite often and have good crowds, and are received wtih much hospitality. When I lee-tured in Rome we had a house full, the best theater in the city; and Brother ---- has the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">same experiences. Then we sell the books and make about enough money to pay our bills. What a life! This is .really the most carefree existence I have ever known. Sometimes we go for a week without ever seeing a newspaper' so interested ’ are we in other things. Of course, we cannot see into the future very far, but this we know, that he who began this good work in us is able to finish it to his glory, and we trust him.”;—Ga;</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Most Direct Prejudice Killer</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">“During this week’s work I found more preju-, dice than in any receht week I have worked. I worked so hard and sold so few. books that at first I was very much discouraged. But I remembered that this territory had not been worked in a long time, and that last year much prejudice had been broken down; so I concluded that announcing the message would help to overcome prejudice.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tex.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Some Experience This</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">“It was my privilege to get out in the work during the last drive we had, and it was a glorious experience to me. I had three and ode-half hours’ work, and in that time I sold thirty-three books, by the Lord’s grace. Truly the people are more anxious to hear now than ever before. Everybody seems to be interested in what we have to tell them.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pa.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Others Experience This</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">“Had the opportunity of telling the glad tidings to about twenty families who were both willing to listen and to ask questions. A more joyous day I never spent. I can talk to people now who would have scoffed a year ago, but not to all. Unless the Lord prepare a way for the people to pay for the books, soon I shall not be able to sell them. But I am going to keep trying and will give the witness, whether I sell the books or not.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Experiences Peculiarly the Workers’</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">“Oli, what a wonderful privilege It is ! I never appreciated my blessings until I came into the truth. I always thought it necessary to have great wealth in order to have happiness. But though I am now occupying the most humble position Imaginable, livipg in a cabin and, days that I am not colportering, earning my bread doing any menial labor, yet I never was so happy in my life. And I want to tell you how much I appreciate The Watch Tower.&quot;—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Call],</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Increased Time Allotted for Service</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">“It was my privilege, by the Lord’s grace, to devote two days of the past week in the service. Yesterday I didn’t meet with much response, but surely enjoyed the privilege. I believe we get a special blessing by going over the territory the second time, as I find that those who received the message last year are anxious to hear more and also to get more literature. There certainly seems to be greater opportunity than ever.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pa.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Elements that Service Only</span><br><br><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Can Develop</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">“If only more of the friends could appreciate what a help the service is in building character and' strengthening faith more of them would put forth greater effort to be out in the service. 1 must tell you how thankful I am that by the Lbrd’s grace I have now disposed of all my Zgs —one thousand eight-hundred. When first they were sent to me I felt somewhat reluctant about taking so many and thought I would surely be obliged to send some of them back. Then I consulted the Ix&gt;rd. So the decision was to do with my might what my hands found to do, and this is the result: no bitterness, but thankfulness for the privilege. Am more determined to continue in patience, that after having done the will of God 1 may receive the promise.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Colo.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>“Praying and Watching Unto”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">“Last Thursday morning while offering up her morning prayer to the heavenly throne a sister asked the Father’s blessing on those who would be privileged to go out canvassing, and if he so willed that she might have some blessing along this line. Shortly afterward an agent called, and in a few minutes she began talking to him about the books. He became deeply Interested, in fact, forgot all about bis business, and went away with all three of the books of the combination. And While she was talking to him on the porch, another man passed by and happening to hear them walked up and said : ‘That’s just what I’ve been wanting, to get’. So he took a ‘Millions’ book. About an hour afterward the agent returned and asked her if he might talk to her again about these wonderful things; so an hour was spent telling him something of the wonderful plan. He promised to attend the meetings. The next morning the postman called and asked for the book ‘Can the.Living Talk with the Dead?’ He wished to give it to a friend, another postman, who was almost convinced that spiritism was the thing to look into. He wished to have his friend read the book, for he said it was absolute proof that the demons are the ones that are talking instead of our dead friends.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tex.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Work a Privilege for All</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">“From all indications I had come to the conclusion that it was the Lord’s will for me to go forth myself with the glad message instead of having to apply for a colporteur, as I had thought of doing. It seemed at the time that I could not devote as many hours as I wished, or as were required of me; but I praise the Lord that he has made his will in the matter clear to me. The little time I have had to put in has been so blessed by the Lord. One afternoon I sold six sets of the combination and gave the witness to a number; then another afternoon I was privileged to get two subscriptions to The Gowen Age and two to The Watch Tower. When making a back call I got the promise of another subscription to The Golden Age. I had very great blessings at one place where I had the privilege of witnessing to a whole room full. Most of them were entirely disgusted with churchianity; but the lady of the house is in Babylon and told me that she could not believe what I was telling her. I asked whether she believed the Bible. ‘Oh yes,’ she replied. ‘Then you believe every word I’m telling you,’ I gaid. She bought the combination set.” &gt;</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>What the People Canvassed Think</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">“Enclosed you will find a letter written by one who has been benefited by our efforts to tell the message.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Okla.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Am writing thanking you for the Gowen Age pamphlets sent us and also to inform the little lady that wore glasses, who sold us the books, that they are wonderful. The last one my father is reading through the fourth time, and he says he can never tire of reading it. It has been' a blessing to him. If she should come back here and has time we would be glad to have her call. Those books have surely opened our eyes, and to think how we have been misled. Father wanted the Methodist minister to take the one book and read, but he said he had a library full of that kind of books ; but we told him that his were not books like this.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>What Hard Times Mean for Service</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">“The district we worked Is in the coal region, and the poverty there is great. The men have done no work this year, and now the mining machinery is being moved. Houses in which the miners live, company houses, are being sold for twenty dollars each. The poverty of the miners is very touching. Often when being canvassed and hearing something of the Golden Age that is very near they burst into tears and say, ‘We won’t have to go hungry then, shall we?’ Both dur public meetings were rained out, and we wondered what the Lord’s will was in the matter. Now we think we know why: he wanted ns to have the jojys of personal service. Never have we had such a response to the message. Sales are good, though money is scarce. Free literature is being asked for, and we are using issues of The Golden Age to meet some of this demand. The canvassers are often asked to return; sometimes reluctance is expressed at their leaving at all in less than an hour or two. It is such a blessing to comfort them now ! Our class Is small, hardly ever more than five or six of ns able to work together; but the spirit of the friends is wonderful.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Okla.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">‘‘Today I went to deliver ‘The Harp’ to a lady who had bought several of the books and who had ordered ‘The Harp’. She asked if I would take back the books she had already bought, as they were not what she thought they were, for she did not understand that they vere written by the same Russell that started the Russellite sect. I asked how much of them she had read, and she said : ‘Very little’. So I told her to forget all she had ever heard of the author and to compare the books with her Bible and use her own judgment, which no doubt was just as good if not better than that of the ones who think they know what the books contain without ever having read them. I told her that I believed I had done her a good turn when I sold them to her, and that it would not be very consistent to take them back while I knew what they contained and she did not. That settled it, and she bought ‘The Harp’. I believe she will read them more earnestly now than if, nothing had been said against them.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pa.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Impresses Value of Offer</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">“Some of the workers have found in selling books that it works well to tell the people that the price of the ‘The Finished Mystery’ was $1.00, but that now we are selling it for 78 cents and giving two pamphlets away with it. This explanation is found especially advantageous where the person canvassed has already purchased a ‘Millions’ book some time previous, and the suggestion is then made that they give one of the ‘Millions’ books to some friend. Many people have promised the workers to do this.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">N. Y.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">“A sister finding a woman who liked to study along lines that bore something of a mysterious character tactfully referred to the Seventh Volume, pointing out a few things concerning the Ezekiel temple.

<p><span class="font0">“One lady who was canvassed hesitated in her decision and was pressed to frankly say why she would not buy. She said, ‘Well, our ministers tell us so many things about that Russell teaching’. This gave the brother a new hold to tell the truth. As a result a sale was made.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Calif.</span></p>

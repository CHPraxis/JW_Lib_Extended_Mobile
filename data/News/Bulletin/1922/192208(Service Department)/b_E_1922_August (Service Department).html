<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.” Isaiah</span><span class="font3"> 61:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A</span><span class="font3">RE you a child of the King? Are you a soldier in his army? If so, you have a commission to do certain things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Happy is the man or the woman who holds such a commission. The words of the commission open thus: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me”—to do so and so. And what is there for me to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Longing for The King, Yet Fearful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In nominal Christendom there are millions of people who love order and peace and righteousness, but who are held in restraint becuase of fear of the beastly order of things and who are therefore much in distress. The World War brought sorrow to millions of them, and the wickedness of man has made, countless millions mourn. They mark the death of their loved ones; 'and although they have claimed to be following the Lord, they see nothing but sorrow and death before them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Confidence Revived by Those “Anointed”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The members of the Lord’s specially anointed, however, have a certain duty to perform toward this great host of sorrowing ones; and their duty is pointed out in the commission given by God through the prophet thus: To give unto them that mourn in Zion beauty for ashes. Ashes are a symbol of sorrow and death. It is the privilege and duty, then, of the followers of Christ Jesus to take away these ashes of mourning from the oeople and show to them the beauties of the kingdom, the resurrection of the dead, and the blessings that will come with the feign of Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Comfort Jehovah Designed for Mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All over the earth the creation groans in pain, greatly desiring and praying for deliverance. They are mourning because of their plight and miserable condition. The Lord has commissioned his faithful ones to give to these the oil of joy for mourning. This means that it is our duty to bring to the knowledge of these people that which will take away their mourning and fill their hearts with joy. They have the spirit of heaviness. They have lost hope. Our privilege is to dispel this darkness and heaviness and to clothe them with the garment of praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Chosen to Deliver Comfort</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This can be done by none others save those who have the message of the Lord. The purpose of thus doing is plainly pointed out by the prophet: “That they (these millions) might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.” A green tree is a symbol of life. Trees of righteousness, then, would mean the grant ing of an opportunity for life to the millions of the earth; and those who receive the mes-sageand obey it shall thus be planted by the Lord and will be a glory to his name. This is another way of stating the message that kingdom of heaven is here, and that thos' hear and obey this message of the k*<sup>r </sup>will live forever and will not di“.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Instructors in Righteousness</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has graciously armed his people with the message, put into such form that it may be used to give beauty instead of ashes, joy instead of mourning, praise instead of heaviness. This message of comfort from God’s Word is truly called his harp; for it is a harmonious statement of the divine plan. Now the Lord has provided “The Harp of God,” the book stating in plain phrase the salient features of the divine plan, which when read in connection with the Bible brings joy to the sad and peace to the troubled of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Greater Works Than These”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The responsibility of carrying this message rests upon those who are begotten and anointed of the holy spirit. It is plainly set forth here by' the Lord’s prophet that the one purpose of the anointing is that this message shall be given. In times past the angels of heaven have been used for some specific purpose in bringing comfort to individuals; but the angels have never enjoyed the privilege of taking the message of the kingdom to great numbers of people. The honor conferred upon the consecrated and anointed ones of the Lord is therefore second to none that has ever been given to any creature aside from the Lord Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan’s Opposition Particularly in Workers’ Ranks</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And while this is due to be done and is being done, Satan is marshaling all of his forces a'nd lodging them against the people of the Lord to overthrow some by one method and some by another. It is his last desperate attempt to control mankind. But we know it will fail. Let each one, then, who has this commission avail himself or herself of the opportunity now to press on in the battle, seizing every possible opportunity to put into the hands of the sad, mournful, distressed ones of humanity the word of consolation which the Lord has given unto them to carry to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A Great and Important Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This privilege and honor should not bring <sup>J:</sup>ness to any one; but on the contrary cause each to walk with fear and r before the Lord, being always de that which pleases him. Let us remember that his work does not depend upon us, but that our salvation depends upon our faithful performance of the work that has been committed to us. Let us further keep in mind that we are the representatives of his kingdom; and as such it is our privilege to make known the fact that he is here; that his kingdom is at hand; that the old world is done; that God’s vengeance is upon the devil’s order; and that soon the old heavens and old earth will completely pass away and be succeeded by the new heavens and earth; and. that millions now living, if obedient to righteousness, will continue to live forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is the business of the King. If we are the king’s, members of his army, his business is our business; and blessed is our privilege to have a part in his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Travelers’ Opportunities</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yesterday morning I went out of P----to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">work for the first time. The train I took to C--- (ten miles from P----) stops in P----</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">twenty minutes for breakfast. • I immediately boarded the train and began to hand out copies of G. A. No. 69 and to tell the message. I went back to my seat to get another supply of G. A.’s and just then the Christian minister came and said; ‘Good morning. Are you leaving town for good?’ I said; 'I am on my way to C--- to tell the people there that</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">there are millions of people living who will never die.’ He sat down beside me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“On my way to C---people began to gather</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">round to hear me talk. He was getting pretty uneasy, and never said a word. Soon a man tapped me on the shoulder and said; ‘Lady, there’s a gentleman in the back end of the car who cannot hear all you are saying and wants you to come back there and talk. The minister hopped up and said; ‘He can come down here and have my place,’ at the same time making his way to the back of the. car like a bolt of lightning. Well, then I started to get off at C---— many said; ‘Oh,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">don’t leave the car now; we want to hear you talk more.’ I expressed my regrets at having to leave them, selling one HARP, one MILLIONS, and giving them all a G. A. with my name and address, telling them to write. Many went to the opposite side of the car to wave me good-bye as I stood on the platform when the train pulled out, I worked four and one-half hours and sold six</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I was told many times before I went to C— ‘You’ll not sell anything there; persecution is too rife.” It will take another day to finish C---•, but I ran out of HARPS and am</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">clear out now; did not know I was so short.” —Kans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I find the Popular edition of the Harp is by far the best for the following reasons.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">I. It is lighter to carry for the colporteur and enables them to take along a supply and deliver as they sell.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. It is easier for the student to carry in the pocket when moving about.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. It is nicer to handle when reading.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. It is more apt to be read thru than the larger and more formidable looking book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. The transportation costs are much less.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">6. The self-quiz card can be placed in the small book and is large enough to project out calling attention to its presence and also acting as a book mark. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■—Ont.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Memoir of a Week’s Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“One day recently I found two ladies a few doors apart who were much interested, but who said they would not have the money until the first of the month. I left the book with them; and when I called back I found that they were sisters. Both were enjoying the HARP and will get the set of STUDIES soon. One of them said that she gets up a little earlier in the morning to read, as she is very busy, but finds a new interest in life since the day I called and explaihed some of the things that have so long puzzled her--</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Indeed, this is the greatest of all work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I met a lady who had manifested much interest at the time I sold the books to her, and she told me she had been wondering about our meetings. She went with me that evening to the beginners’ meeting here, where there were twenty in attendance, fifteen of whom were hearing these things for the first time. This setms to be one of the ways the meetings begin, without effort on our part as soon as the people are ready for them, as this one started just that way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ A lady said she did not want to buy the books' without first consulting a friend of rs. Next time I called the friend was </span><span class="font1">--<sup>J</sup> botnzht miWRlMATTOK WARP </span><span class="font3">and SCENARIO. The husband of the first lady was home that day, and listened to what was said. Later on a note was sent me requesting that I call for the books, as they were not what she had thought they were. I told her that I believed she had a great responsibility as ' an unusually good student of the Bible to show me wherein the books were not in harmony with the Bible, and that I would at least expect her to show me where they were unscriptural. She answered that they were Scriptural, but that they were Russell’s teachings, and of course he didn’t believe in hell. So when I told her he wrote more concerning hell than any other writer, she was perplexed; and when I explained the Bible interpretation to the other lady the next time I called (which explanation I purposely withheld while her friend was there), she wanted the books and said that she would read them without telling her friend as what we believe seems so much more reasonable.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Another who intended going to a Christian Science testimony meeting one evening decided to stay at home and rest and have the HARP read to her. Next time I called she said that she believed the Lord sent me on time, as this is so much more reasonable, and that she just loves the HARP, as it is so clear and easy to understand. I loaned a HARP to one of Dr. Haldman’s congregation, requesting that she help me see wherein these books were unscriptural, remarking that she had had advantages of education greater than mine and thus had responsibility as a Christian to do so. She suggested that I read Dr. Haldman’s criticism of Pastor Russell. This I told her I had already become familiar with, but so far it had only convinced me more fully that these interpretations were the correct ones.”N. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Anything that indicates how the people are receiving the- message will be interesting I know. I will mention therefore that some one who had heard the truth at one of our public lectures but who was not associated with a class of Bible Students at all, desired that if possible her friends should get me to preach her funeral sermon. 'Through the co-ope-ation of the friends at ------ this arrar *</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ment was made and we had the &gt;&nbsp;’-ivik-about 400 people. This number filled the church to overflowing. It is indeed encouraging to get such an audience without advertising.—</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Ont.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Much of the territory is rural and can only be reached by a great deal of walking, when one has no better means of travelling. If I confined myself to the towns and villages </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">would not reach nearly so many people, so I take in the farms as well, if I can reach them on foot. I find that many of these people have never had an opportunity to get the literature, and they are more ready to listen to the message than the town people. Week before last I spent two days in a settlement which cannot be reached by rail at all. In the two days I covered probably 45 miles on foot, but was well repaid by selling ten of the 85c combinations and 4 odd books. I was invited to come again and hold a meeting in the school-house, which I hope to do when I take the Harp into that district. I take all the books I can. carry on a trip like this. I certainly would advise Colporteurs not to neglect the farms and ranches, if they can be reached.”—</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This noon sold 20 books and gave </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">60 </span><span class="font3">B. S. M. I sure love my work. Praise ye the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord.—Alta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Last week I found a Roumanian man to whom I had loaned a “Millions” in the winter. He had written to the U. S. for a Volume One. Said his books were worth $1,000.00, and he was not afraid now. ‘God send His Kingdom.’ I got him a Roumanian Bible in Buffalo. I have found quite a few people glad to be shown “Our Lord’s Return” booklet in connection with the 85c Combination, and I sell the four books for $1.00.”—</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Ont.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I am realizing more and more, the value of being in constant touch with the various workers and making their personal acquaintance so to speak. I have felt for the last few months that we were not having enough of that sort of thing and that that was probably one cause of the work not developing ns fast as it should. However, it is well nigh mssible to _ accomplish this without the im of a ^special Thursday night meeting, and we here have never been able, under the circumstances, to have such a meeting.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—Ont.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Editor of &quot;The.....Herald” was the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">first to receive the canvass. He bought a combination set and promised to put the write-up of the lecture in his paper. I have concluded the Editor of the rural paper is the most important man in town to get in touch with and should never be overlooked. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—Alta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Harp Course is a very good seller, the people seem to like the idea fine....................</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are two new classes meeting every Sunday in our territory this year, and expect to organize one more shortly.—</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sask.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At ------- two children of a poor family</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">died. The priest wanted $100.00 to take the funeral. Brother ------- using a Catholic</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">-Bible took the service. Since then he has placed many Bibles and books among those who attended the funeral and their friends. They say, “We are done with the priest. We don’t need him any more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Recently I called on an old man who was out of work through old age and not eligible for pension. I told him a few things about the book and he said, “I should very much like to read the book but I can’t possibly afford the money” I asked him if he would read it if 1 loaned same to him and he gladly agreed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The day following I was convasing in that territory and my attention was called by this man who was working out in the yard across the street. He waved his hand at me and beckoned me to come over, which I did. He said, “Mr. -----, I want to keep that book;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">my wife read it half through last night. Come right inside and we will pay you for it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another great thing about this course is the weekly self quiz cards. It is an inspiration to walk to the postoffice every Friday with the bundle of cards grown bigger each week, and to think of the results they will have in persistently calling the readers attention to the questions thereon.—</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Ont.</span></p>

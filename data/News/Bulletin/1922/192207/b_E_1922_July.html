<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>ENDURING HARDSHIPS UNTIL VICTORIOUS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.”—-2 Timothy 2: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A</span><span class="font1"> Christina must hike an active course. He cannot lie lukewarm or indifferent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His course must not be negative, but positive. All the illustrations given by the Apostle lend to this conclusion. The illustration here is that of a soldier who renders services acceptable to his captain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Throughout the go sth? I age this rule of activity and loyalty has obtained, but it is particularly emphasized at this time. The reason is, we have reached the end of the world. The new order Is here; tlie kingdom of heaven is at hand. The King of kings is present, directing his forces. The final conflict is on between the devil’s organization and the Lord’s organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>One Insignia</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The devil’s organization visible is composed of three elements, which constitute the kings of the earth, /thir/s thus used in the Scriptures does not mean the men who wear crowns upon their heads literally. The term refers to the governing factors, made up of three elements: to wit, big business, big politicians, and big ecclesiastics, united for the purpose of controlling mankind. The mastermind behind this organization is Satan, He has subtily induced many of the masses to believe in and sympathize with his organization visible. This they do because they have no knowledge that it is Satan’s organization. Because of this sympathy with the visible part of his organization, namely, the “beast,” they have the “mark of the beast in their foreheads.” Those who are active in giving their best endeavors in support of Satan’s organization have the mark in their hands. These are his active soldiers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Other Insignia</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord’s organization is made up of those who have volunteered to put themselves under the leadership of Christ Jesus, the captain of our salvation. This they did by an unconditional consecration. At the time of making their consecration the full duties to he performed were not known. As each one thus enlisted has increased in knowledge and the graces of the spirit, he has had a keener appreciation of the Lord’s organization. Now lie sees that this organization of the Lord is made up of Jesus Christ and the members of his body, those who have joined him in glory beyond the vail and those who are on tills side. They see thiit because he is present and because he is beginning to reign, Satan's organization is desperately attacking, it is a war between the two mighty forces; and every human being is enlisted in the battle on one side or the other—on Satan’s side, either nctively or sympathetically; or on the Lord’s side, either actively or sympathetically. The victory will be with the Lord. This is plainly recorded, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and because the time has come for his kingdom. When the battle is over and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the victory won. there will be certain victors with Christ Jesus; and these will he not only the called and chosen, but the ones who have stood the final test by proving their loyalty.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Quality of Endeavor Decides</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The test likens the one who will be approved to a good soldier. The inference to be drawn is that there are some soldiers who are not good; therefore do not measure up to the standard. The latter will be those who sympathize with the Lord and his cause, but who through fear or indifference or some other excuse fall to be active and zealous. A good soldier is one who not only has enlisted and started in the warfare on the side of the Lord, hut is active and zealous, and is joyful in his activity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>What the Soldier Must Do</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The soldier of Jesus Christ is not left in doubt as to what he must do. First he has a description of the armor he must wear, as given by the apostle Paul. (Ephesians 6: 10—18) He must not only be fully armed, but he must be a servant of the truth and the truth only. His weapon of warfare is the message of truth, designated the sword of the spirit.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Ignorantly Supporting A Failure</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Satan with his organization is desperately striving to subject the masses of the people By fraud and deceit and by keeping them in ignorance of the Lord’s kingdom. The method of attack by the soldiers of Christ Jesus is to enlighten the people concerning the presence of the King; therefore the end of Satan’s empire, and the great blessing that shall follow shortly, when the Lord will grant unto them a full opportunity for life, liberty and happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Devoting Energies to that Enduring</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The soldier of Jesus Christ, therefore, is engaged in a happy work because he is doing good to his fellow creatures; and this work under the leadership of our Captain, Christ Jesus, will lead to a complete deliverance of the masses of mankind and the complete destruction of Satan’s organization. The good soldier, therefore, will actively and zealously engage in availing himself of every opportunity to make known tlie message of truth, declaring the day of God’s vengeance, pointing to the presence of the new order under tile glorious King, and binding up the brokenhearted by showing the way that leads to life and happiness. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Are you </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">soldier? You must answer this question in the affirmative. You are a soldier on one side of the conflict or the other. There is no middle ground. Either actively or sympathetically you are on one side. Are yon a soldier of Christ Jesus? </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font1">so, what kind of soldier are you—a good soldier or </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font1">indifferent one? These questions each one who knows the truth must answer for himself; and by the Lord's standard it is an easy matter for each one to determine.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Greatest Impediment— Oneself</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font1">inference to be drawn from the words of the text is that the good soldier will have much to endure; hence he must not only be active but develop fortitude also. The new creature who is a soldier of the Lord has a fleshly organism which wars against the mind of the spirit. Satan attempts to fight him through his fleshly organism. It therefore requires patient endurance to keep oneself actively engaged in the Lord’s service and resolutely to endure. Naturally the body becomes tired. Naturally one shrinks from ridicule and persecution, taunts and jeers; but all these things must be endured cheerfully. This endurance must continue not for just a while. It will not do to say: I have been active in the service for a few years and may quit now’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Must Attack</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font1">discussing the same matter in eonnec-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">tion </span><span class="font1">with the end </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">the world and what should be done at this time, Jesus our Captain said: “He that endureth to the end </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">shall </span><span class="font1">be saved.” </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By </span><span class="font1">that we should </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">understand </span><span class="font1">that the good soldier must endure </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font1">endure cheerfully until the end of his racecourse ; hence to the end of the battle.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>In Measure Supporting—</span><br><br><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>When not Molesting</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Dear brethren, the eyes of the hosts of heaven are upon us, the enemy host desiring our defeat; the righteous host desiring our success. Let each one of us, therefore, gird up the loins of our mind ; see to It that our armor is in good condition, and go forth to battle with joyful hearts, remembering the Ap»stle’s admonition; “In due season we diall reap if we relax not.” Remember that your method of attack is by putting the truth into tile minds of the people. The Lord has provided that this may be done by the printed page, by word of mouth, and by personal influence. Lose no opportunity to give this witness to your neighbors, and to those in the district which is assigned to you; and even though it entails much hardness, remember the words of the Apostle and of the Lord Jesns, and endure cheerfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is not a possibility of a donbt as to the result. Blessed is our portion now of being soldiers of the Lord .Tesus Christ. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Great </span><span class="font1">will be our joy when the battle is ended and, by his grace, we may stand victorious with him and be counted as amongst those who were faithful and loyal to the end.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Pass None By</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Last week I was working a small mining camp. Before going there I made inquiry regarding the place, as to size, people, and industry. Some said: 'There is no use going there. They work only one day a week, and you will find much poverty. You will not be able to sell anything.' The Father clearly showed use his will, so I went. The result ■ was that I sold in this small camp 4G books, one Bible, took one Golden Aon subscription, and sold several copies of The Golden Age. I was told that they had a Methodist minister who talked much like myself. So I called on the minister, and was very cordially received. He informed me that he had 'the first three volumes, which he had purchased fust recently. He was reading Volume One find gave me an order for the last four volumes, one of our Bibles, ‘Can the Living Talk with the Dead?’ and the Zg, and paid me at once for all. He then earnestly requested me to attend their Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;The room was well filled; and at that time he told that I had books which explained the Bible, all of which he had purchased, and he advised them to get those helps. All of them earnestly requested me to meet with them the following Thursday evening, and I did. The minister discoursed on Romans 8, and then informed the audience that I would be pleased to answer any questions. So by God’s grace I explained how that millions now living will never die, and dwelt some on God’s wonderful plan. Much interest was manifest. This week I hope,the Lord willing, to give them a chart talk/’-Colo.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">&quot;I canvassed a young minister, who was so pleased to hear the truth that he not only took the Millions book right away and started to read it, but also ordered all the Volumes and the'Sermon book. It so happened that this minister had no charge. He wanted a meeting at his home, and promised to attend all the meetings after procuring the addresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“A huckster on the street told me that he had nothing to do with so-called Christians and was not in harmony with churches. When I told him I did not belong to any of them and commenced to tell him the truth, he said, ‘You are on my side,’ Although he was in a hurry, he bought a set.” — 0. C.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“Just one and one-half years ago we had no class here. A short talk wms given in the home of a widowed sister’s parents, and now we have a class of seven members and quite a few other interested ones. Last night a chart talk was given in the home of some colored people, at which time there were live present. On September 25 we had rile lecture on Millions.”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“How grand it is I Every one in the class can now take a part. It was certainly good to see how the friends, after the meeting yesterday, loaded up with Combinations. This forenoon I took five Combinations and started out. Tlie way they were selling before I thought these would last all day; but iuside of three hours they were all gone. Some did uot have the money on hand; but as they wanted the books, I made arrangements for them to pay later. After the meeting yesterday we had the Combinations on the table. One man took a Millions book, looked through it, took it, placed a twenty-dollar bill in the hand of one of the brethren, and left.” — </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wash.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Combinations and two single books. I went to C----one day in the same month and sold</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">twenty Combinations and four single books alto,gether. Did well for the time I was gone, hut I have to take my baby, which makes it very inconvenient for me.”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">N. H.</span></p>

The gentleman said that the Bible Students were no doubt correct in their procedure aud that worship should be conducted in a community by those chosen from among themselves. To this end he was going to suggest to nine other wealthy men of the town that they each put in one hundred dollars and.purchase the Presbyterian church and turn it over to the Bible Students for community worship.—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Can.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“I find it just as easy to sell the Combination as to sell one of the books. Almost all who are willing to buy will readily buy the three when they don’t want to buy one. For instance, I canvassed a lady for the Millions hook but she said she could not buy it unless I would take twenty cents, as she did not have another five cents. I tried to impress on her the value of the message it contains, stating that we were almost giving it away, hut eon Id not convince her. I took out the other books to prove what I was saying.

<p><span class="font1">“The Methodist minister was hearing the class. He made the statement that immortality was not mentioned in the Old Testament and that the New Testament said we are to seek immortality. One present made the remark, 'That is what the Russellites believe.’ The minister replied, with some confusion, that Russell was not the founder of that teaching, but had simply stolen it from the Bible.”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pa.</span></p>

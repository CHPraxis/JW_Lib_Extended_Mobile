<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Titov h-'ixt MMwmided to keep thy precepts diligently.—Psalm 119:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A</span><span class="font4">DVERTISE the King and the Kingdom.” Let this be the slogan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>L</sup> As suggested in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> for September, the issue is squarely drawn between Satan’s organization and the followers of Christ. The resolution adopted by the Inter-im4.io.iuil Bible Students in convention at Cedar Point■ clearly defines the issue. Let the world leaders who represent Satan come forth with their proof justifying their position tlmt the desire of the nations can be obtained through international conference. We know that such proof is not possible. Then it devolves upon us to testify the ■ truth to the world. The Klug is here, has taken unto himself his power, and reigns. Onr business, then, is to act as his publicity agents, advertising to the world that the panacea for the ills of mankind is Messiah’s kingdom; that the desire of all nations can come through the Messiah and in no other way.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Disclose Reason for Unrest</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The rulers of earth are in perplexity, the people in distress, and daily the spirit of unrest is increasing. The common people are entitled to know the reason why. If there is u remedy, it is our privilege to tell them of that remedy. Yea, the obligation is hud upon all true Christians to tell the people the truth now. The Lord has committed unto his people the message of comfort and reconciliation. The truth ,1s the only consolation that can be given to the people. A failure now to tell them the truth would be to shirk our responsibility.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Supply Panacea</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Our text shows that the Lord, commands his followers to ascertain his will as expressed lit ids tvord ami then diligently to what he has commanded. Diligence means the very opposite of slothfuhiess. It means slertness and activity. This is no time for indifference or negligence, but a time for strenuous efforts. It means that we shall be watching for opportunities of service mid seizing every opportunity as it comes. Remember, each one is responsible to the Lord for a proper use of his talents. Let each one ask himself the question: Am I bending every effort to testify the message to the world in this time? Am I diligent in keeping the commandments of the Lord? Let the answer be given honestly to the Lord and to ourselves. If not doing all, you can, then become active and diligent at once. If doing what you cau, then do not become weary in well doing, but remember that in due time you shall reap, if you faint not-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are millions who have not heard of the message of the kingdom. They must hear. If faithful in that which the Lord has committed to our hands, he.has promised to advance such faithful ones to more important positions. This faithfulness must continue to the very end of onr earthly course. .</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>'‘Resolution&quot; Tracts</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Resolution adopted at Cedar Point must go to the rulers and to the people. This Resolution embodied with other matter in a free tract is being issued by the millions. In a short while you will receive your quota. They will be sent to you free of charge; except that the classes will be expected to pay the transportation charges. These we will pay in advance, however, and send you a bill later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These tracts should be distributed carefully. Be sure not to waste them. Do net throw them on the lawns or porches, but take the time to ring the bell and hand them in and say a pleasant word to the one wJ» responds. This will open the way for you to canvass for the books later.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Method of Action</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">We strongly urge tlie brethren everywheie to adopt the following method of distribution: Tuesday, October 31 (the anniversary of Brother Russell’s change), is set for th; general distribution of the tract throughout united crates ana canudti. Tjci. rhe Service Director thoroughly organize the entire force of the class. Lei every oue in the class engage in doing his or her part. The rural district of your territory should ba first worked on October 31, The Service Director should send the entire force to the suburbs or smaller towns in the district, dividing them into companies. Distribute the tracts carefully, seeing to it that they are placed in the hands of the people or handed in at the door. Cover as much territory as possible on the 31st. Then on the following days of the same week canvass that same territory where the tracts have been distributed for the combinations. Get everybody in the class to participate in the canvass for the books as well as in the distribution of the tracts. After the people have read the tracts they will be anxious to see the books. Strike while the iron is hot. While canvassing for the combination if you find some one who desires The Hasp or the Studies in the Scbtttitbes, or any of the rest of the books, take the order. Let the combination have precedence over the others as far as the canvass is concerned, and as long as the combinations last. As soon ns your stock of combinations is exhausted, then proceed with the house to house can-vi'ss with The IIabp of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The week following, namely, November 7, . let the distribution of the tracts begin in the cities; and when the tracts are out, carefully go over the territory with the workers as it was done in the country until the city is thoroughly canvassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Remember, first distribute the tracts, and then go over the same territory as quickly as possible thereafter and canvass the people for the books.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Witness to 30 Nationalities</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This tract is now being issued in English, and will shortly be translated and published in the thirty-odd other languages in which the truth is now published and sent out for distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is a big job, bnt it is a blessed one. The purpose is to give a witness to the world. Let r.-oc-h clusrr strengthen its organization, enlisting every one in the work who can work. Go at the work systematically and with the determination to do it to the Lord's glory. Remember the commandment from the Lord at this time: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come.” And remember onr text: “Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Logical Steps of Activities</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The distribution of these tracts will create a wide interest in the publications of the Watch Tower Bible A Tract Society; for the Resolution makes certain statements, and the jieople who read it will in all probability desire to find the authority for the statements therein. The geueral worldwide meetings on October 29th, together with the advertisement for these meetings appearing in the previous week’s newspapers, will begin to stir up interest. Following this, the distribution of 10,000,000 copies of the Resolution in the United States will increase this interest. This, followed</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">B U L L »T 1 A</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">us quickly as possible with the canvass for * the combination, will create still further interest and will be an excellent means of advertising the King and the Kingdom. Our mission is to announce the kingdom of our Lord, and the books that are being sold will best accomplish this object. The people’s attention must be called to the. hooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Phenomenal Events st. ch at:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">An 87- ton meteor striking the earth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A ten-and-a-half-inch path of paper from New York to San Francisco,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A seven-car trainiood t f paper,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A one-inch band of paper reaching around the earth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Or a flutter of snowflakes a Quarter of an inch square, alighting on every square inch of land surface in the United States,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">would cause world-wide comment.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">Such a demonstration could be made with merely the .material used for these tracts. People would be compelled to note such , events; for of themselves these command ' attention. Of no less consequence will he the distribution of the Resolution.' Its message will command as much attention, calling, as it does, for thinking instead of physical exhibition. Attention thus so pointedly attracted should also disclose the object— The Klug and the Kingdom. While the people are abjectly wondering what, is to follow, what hope they have if even the present unrighteous system, as unsatisfactory as it is, is abolished, bring to their attention that he, the King, is here and that he is establishing his kingdom. Supply them with the proof of this, the “Millions” book, the “Finished Mystery,&quot; and “Can the Living Talk with the Dead?” Let them prove</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">-f--,-------------------- -------- . _ - -</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">; for themselves that it is true. Let them understand why this demonstration, why j the King is being announced; yes, and how ■ they might live to see such a favorable ; reign inaugurated on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through this concerted effort you have . begun to Advertise the King and the Kingdom; then reap the results of the advertising ; see people seeking meekness, seeking ■ righteousness, conforming their lives to the new order, supporting the new Klug. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>:</sup> Hahp Bible Study Coukse will instruct them how to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We trust that the tracts will reach you in time, so that ample preparation can be made ' for this distribution. They will come to you folded in lots of eight tracts to a fold. These can be separated either before you proceed to your field or as you distribute them.</span></p>

It illustrated how the Bible contains ten fundamental truths, all yielding a beautiful harmonious melody. The time has eome to understand God'a Word, and it can. now lie understood. An Sunday School superintendents, teachers and pupils, young and old, need this book. Tt is arranged in eleven chapters ; and following each chapter is a list of questions, numbered to correspond to the paragraph where the answer may lie found. It answers practically every Biblical question you could think Sf.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The second, Justice Manifested against wrongdoing. This is really the minor chord of the harp, but it lends harmony to the whole when one.e understood.</span></p>

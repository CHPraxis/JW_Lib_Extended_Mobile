<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TAKE THE LORD AS YOUR PARTNER</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At this time practically everybody in the truth is in the service work; and as service workers for the Lord they can well take a lesson from the note book of Nehemiah, who learned early in life to make the Lord his partner in all his enterprises on behalf of God and his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The bool; of Nehemiah opens with a prayer. Eight out of the eleven verses of the first chapter record Nehemiah’s prayer for the blessing of God upon the work he had in mind to do for his king. The fourth verse of the second chapter makes reference to another prayer; the ninth chapter contains a prayer thirty-four verses long; and the concluding words of the last chapter are, “Remember me, 0 my God, for good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nehemiah was all for the Lord’s business which, at that time, was the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem, stone by stone, in the face of his enemies, who were also the enemies of his God and of ours. His work was somewhat like ours. We also are rebuilding the wall of the true Christian faith, and we are doing it in the presence of enemies. The text, “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies,” has its application now. The Lord is doing the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ruling;</span><span class="font0"> but we are doing the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">work </span><span class="font0">of the kingdom, and delighted to have that joy and that honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let us learn a lesson from Nehemiah, farsighted. industrious, fearless, skilful, successful. He was all of these because he was prayerful. He made the Lord his comrade, his friend, his manager, his tutor, his guide. The same Lord is still rich in mercies, able and willing to bestow them superabundantly upon all those who really wish them and will use them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The happiest people in the service work are those who have learned to keep in constant contact with the Lord, before, during and after their canvassing work. Is it hard to find time to get out in the work ? Tell the Lord about it, and ask him to show you how it can be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Are you successful in the work? You lose not a second of time if after each sale, as you are on your way to the next call, you tell the Lord how thankful and happy you are to have left one more message behind you that tells of his kingdom. Are you unsuccessful ? Remember that the Lord himself has said, “If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.”—James 1: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Follow Nehemiah’s example. Start out with a prayer, be instant in prayer and thankfulness as you go along from door to door; maize it your business to see to it that you are backing up your prayers by the use of the best judgment and the greatest industry iu your power; and then, at the close of another happy day, you can even follow Nehemiah’s example again and go humbly into the presence of your God and say, “Remember me, 0 my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, . . . Remember me, 0 my God, for good” (Nehemiah 13: 14, 31) ; and that prayer will be answered to your everlasting joy of heart, the same as all the others.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>METHODS OP WORK</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">The coming winter reminds us that even with all the handicaps, it is one of the most effective times of the year for work in the field, when people are probably better situated to read and listen to workers that call at their homes. We have, therefore, in our letter to directors outlined the procedure for work during the winter months. Directors have been asked to prepare territory for canvassing that will permit the workers during the winter months to reach people who are already acquainted with I. B. S. A. publications. Such homes are particularly those that have purchased booklets, those who have purchased the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Harp</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance </span><span class="font0">and homes in which there are radios. Workers calling at homes that are already sympathetic toward the truth are more certain of an invitation to come in. and talk over the books.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>A New Combination</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">We believe that a combination that would serve them for reference purposes would more nearly meet the requirement. Therefore we recommend that workers offer during the winter months the seven volumes of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures, Deliverance</span><span class="font0"> and “Judge Rutherford’s latest book, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,”</span><span class="font0"> at $3.00. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font0"> will be released to the public December 1, and is to retail at 45 cents. The book is illustrated with colored pictures representing a selection of pictures that hang in the national galleries of Europe. They represent paintings of different artists, many of which have not been reproduced in any publications that have been circulated in America. The cover and binding of the book are also done with a new process which will not be found in any other publication up to the present time. Therefore from the standpoint of book value alone, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font0"> represents additions that other publications do not have and at a much more reasonable rate. We merely mention the art feature and the binding as additional talking points to be mentioned in connec--tion with the canvass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font0"> is to be offered in combination with other books; and since winter work docs not generally permit the same number of homes to be called upon, the work is being planned with a view of placing substantial combinations of books in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Limited Offer</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">For some time </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Studies to the Scriptures </span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font0"> have been offered at $3.78 for the eight books. As a special offer during the next six months, ot until June 1, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font0"> will be added to this eight-volume combination, and will be offered to the people at $3.00. Canvassing for the nine-volume combination for $3.00 is the principal feature of winter work. In the event you are unable to place the nine volumes, then we recommend that you offer </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation </span><span class="font0">at 78 cents. In homes that have not purchased </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font0"> we recommend that you offer </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font0"> at $1.18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The records that have been kept will indicate what has been sold in the homes that you call upon; and if booklet combinations only have been sold then the nine-volume offer is the logical offer, dropping to the three-volume combination at $1.18 or the two-volume combination at 78 cents.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>A Gift Suggestion</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">December finds many people busy and anxious for suggestions for Christmas gifts. Workers should emphasize that they are malting the first offer of “Judge Rutherford’s latest book, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation”</span><span class="font0"> that they can call on only a limited number of homes before Christmas, and that consequently people that use </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font0"> as Christmas remembrances can be pretty well assured that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font0"> will not be used by others as a gift to their friends. Again, the nine-volume combination should be offered as an excellent Christmas gift, especially since it is accompanied by the Society’s latest publication, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span><span class="font0"> In homes that have the eight volumes, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation </span><span class="font0">can be offered at 45 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Winter work has its peculiarities and its obstacles. We hope that the plans will get workers into the homes and will have the hearty cooperation of the workers so that the winter work of 1927-1928 will see an increase like the past year’s work has been over previous year’s activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font0"> is being forwarded to each class on consignment. A prerun consignment contains the first copies printed and forwarded to the friends so that they can have them well in advance of the public. We trust that you will be able to make good use of your advance copy and become acquainted with the contents of the book, so that you can present its main features to the people upon whom you call.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Emphasize New Book</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">We believe that one of the best talking points is that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font0"> is “Judge Rutherford’s latest book”, released for circulation, December 1. People arc anxious to be up to date and anything that is new appeals to them. Therefore, in undertaking the work with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font0"> we trust that workers will adopt in some way the suggestion contained in this </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font0"> of emphasizing the advantage to homes of a comprehensive work covering all Bible questions; a work which includes “Judge Rutherford’s latest book, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation”.</span><span class="font0"> Endeavor to point out the advantages of getting the eight volumes and the new book at the reduced rate, and that this is made possible because of the reduced rate at which </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font0"> is offered to the people when it is sold in combination with the other books. Workers can be assured that by offering eight volumes they will never hinder or defeat the sale of a smaller cambination, and should also recognize that by offering merely a small combination, many homes are missed that would purchase the larger combination if they knew about it. Present all publications and let the people decide what is in their means to purchase. The result will be a great increase in the sale of the nine-volume combinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Trusting that the coming winter work will effect the wide distribution of the nine-volume combination that the field is really prepared for, and assuring you of our interest in the efforts you are putting forth to realize the full advantage of the work already done, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With Christian greetings, your brethren in the service of the King of kings,</span></p>

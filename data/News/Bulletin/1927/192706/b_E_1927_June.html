<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>PROVOKE UNTO LOVE AND TO GOOD WORKS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“And let us consider one another, to provoke unto love and to good ivories.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">—Hebrews 10:24-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">T</span><span class="font2">HE word provoke here used in the Greek is not the word which means to irritate or exasperate, or to provoke in an unpleasant sense, but has the significance of incitement and is better translated in the Diaglott; “Wo should bear each other in mind for an incitement of love and good works.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Actually the word here is a noun, and not a verb at al], so that the real thought is not that we should provoke somebody else, but that we should ourselves be incited to action by what we see others do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is, of course, nothing wrong in inciting others to love and to good works. The Society has done much of this, and expects to do more, as opportunity provides; but that is not the sense of the text.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Lessons from Others</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The main thought in the text is that each of us should look about us in the body of Christ and see there the sincerity, the love for the Lord and His truth and His people manifested by some of those whom we know; and that this should incite or inspire us to greater love and more abundant good works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Heretofore some of the elders, and even some of the pilgrims and prominent ones at headquarters and elsewhere, have had the idea that what is specially required of them is to urge others forward to the selling of books; but as far as they themselves are concerned, they are excused and excusable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No such meaning can be taken out of this text. The text means that we should attentively consider the faithful and courageous and zealous and loving disseminators of the truth, and should be incited by their example to renewed interest and activity in carrying out our consecration vows in the spreading of the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Jesus Our Example</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In effect the apostle was saying to the Hebrews, “Brethren, give a little consideration to your fellow members in the body and mark their course. You see some of them carrying out their consecration vows in a very faithful manner. Your observation of their course should have the same effect upon you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The apostle, indeed, might have pointed to himself as a shining example of faithfulness in both of these respects, love for God, and zeal and earnestness in the doing of His will. In some other passages of his writings the apostle has actually done this, as when he says, “Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.”—1 Corinthians 11:1; Philip-pians 3: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The apostle did not want anybody to follow him in any literal sense. He did not want personal followers. Christ was consumed with zeal for His Father’s house. The apostle was a follower of Christ in that sense, and i the sense that he thus followed his Master he wished, properly, that the churches at Corinth and Philippi should follow his example, and faithfully make good the promises of entire devotion to the doing of God’s will which they had made at the time of their consecration and anointing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.”—Galatians 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Christian has something to give which none other can give. If he has the holy spirit in his heart, he is able to give comfort; and no other can give it as well. Notice how this is stated by the Apostle Paul in his letter to the Corinthians:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be God. even the Father of out Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort: who comforteth ns in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and salvation. And our hope of you is sted-</span><span class="font2">fast, knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, .so shall yc bo also of the consolation.”—3 Corinthians 1: 2-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is our business, inasmuch as we have the comforter dwelling within us, to spread this comfort as widely as we can. If oui' literature he examined it will be found to he brimming full of comfort for the people, comfort for the Jews, comfort all around. Not only is it comfort for the saints (although it is specially so for them) but it is comfort for everybody. Let us do our level best to give of it to all men as freely as we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">METHODS OF WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We regret that the moving of the headquarters has occupied the efforts at Bethel so that the close touch with the field was not maintained. Anticipating that moving the machinery would stop production, efforts were concentrated upon the providing of books and booklets in such quantities as to insure to the. workers a supply of literature. In this manner headquarters kept in close touch with the field in supplying your needs so that the moving would not interfere with the canvassing work. We do not think that the demand made upon our time in moving should interfere with the field work in any way, and we regret that the close contact established by means of the Bulletins should he interfered with for a time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Increase Reported</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The field has reported excellent results for the first six months of 1927; and we believe that, both from the standpoint of the number engaged in the work and from the distribution of literature, results show a proportionate increase that each worker’s efforts contributed toward the great total increase. Every department of activity shows an increase. In the eastern section of the country and the far western part and the southern section, however, there is a drop in the sales of complete sets of Studies in tut Scriptures. We are hoping that the enthusiasm that is partner to having a new book, Deliverance, was not such as to have workers concentrate, too much upon a single vol ume. There is a number of homes in which Studies in the Scriptures have heen placed ; but by far the majority of the homes have not had Studies in the Scriptures; and from those sections of the country which are pushing the Studies in the Scriptures sales we are sure that greater results to the workers will he had if the workers concentrate on the eight-volume combination offer as they did last year, especially in the eastern and western sections.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Let the Sale Be Eight Volumes</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font2">work last year saw the canvassing </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font2">the eight-volume combination well under way. The workers presented the eight volumes to those they canvassed, and no doubt many people who selected a booklet or the Harp Bible Study Course instead of buying the eight volumes did so merely to look into the literature and to make up their minds regarding the other seven volumes that were offered them. Take advantage of this, and see that the people still have opportunity of obtaining the full set of Studies tn the Scriptures. It is not likely that they will take the initiative and ask for the seven volumes. Rather will they take the alternative and buy the booklets you offer them instead.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Rendering</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deliverance brings to the people a message of relief from bondage and oppression. Deliverance is good news to the people, but good news must be verified. It must be proven. There must be something to </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">prompt </span><span class="font2">the people themselves to establish the fact that the message of deliverance </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font2"> true. Studies in the Scriptures supplement the message of deliverance by providing the detailed information on the subjects that people are interested in. People who have been Presbyterians must needs have cleared up in their minds the doctrine of election. Methodists, of free grace ; Baptists, that of baptism. The message of Deliverance is what they ha.ve heen yearning for, but these other points must also be cleared up so that the full benefit of the message may be had. Studies in the Scriptures allow this. In fact, Studies in the Scriptures deliberately discuss the small details that tend to perplex people. They place the literature in homes in a permanent form.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Prepare for Next Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The single volume with </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">combination of booklets can be offered when the people decline to purchase the seven volumes of Studies in the Scriptures. But the sale of the single volumes and the booklets has one object in view: To create an interest in Studies in the Scriptures. Directors have reported that workers have sold over </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">150,000 </span><span class="font2">copies of Deliverance and the lecture series so far this year. In addition there are many thousands of booklets that have been placed. Territory that has been reached should find people ready for the Studies in the Scriptures canvass; and workers will likely find that canvassing for the Studies in the Scriptures and Deliverance at $2.78 will not interfere with their selling combinations of Deliverance and booklets. They will also find that canvassing exclusively for Deliverance and the booklets will positively interfere with their placing the eight volumes in the home of the people, because the people cannot purchase what they do not know anything about. Homes where you have already placed the eight volumes can be approached with the Deliverance and the canvass for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">subscription to the Golden Age and The Watch Towj®, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">combination of booklets, and likewise the homes that you. have previously canvassed for the Deliverance and booklets, can be approached with a canvass for the eight-volume combination of Studies in the Scriptures and the Harp Bible Study Course. The full-page advertisements on the back of the Golden Age contain some ideas as to arguments upon which to build your canvass for the eight-volume combination.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Reaching the People</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The many favorable reports that are being received regarding Sunday work indicate that there is a good field for activity yet to be developed. Letters we receive are of the tone of the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the past month we have been going out on Sunday mornings from nine to twelve. That is our service day. All the friends say they look for Sunday to come so they can go out in the service. There is a zealous brother in our class for his age. He is 81 years young, he says. Last Sunday, in three hours work, he sold three sets of volumes, including the Harp and Deliverance, and thirteen small booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The reason why we go out on Sunday is that this is the only day when the brothers can go. So the class voted to go out on Sundays. The only thing we regret is that we did not start sooner.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fred Steinborn,—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kokomo, Ind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This seems quite natural, especially in the rural districts. People have much time on their hands on Sunday. They have learned that the churches do not supply them with any real food on Sunday, and consequently they regard meetings held in the schoolhouse as but another church holding some sort of revival. That is the reason why we must go to the people with the message. Sunday generally finds the men near the house, and almost always finds the people with some ready money. Farmers have returned from market ^vith some money, laborers have been paid at the close of the week, and sales can be more readily made. Sunday seems to be a very favorable time for the eight-volume combination offer. Your visit will have brought to the home a message that leaves them some joy and comfort. But there are other Sundays that workers will not call at the same home, and Deliverance and Scripture Studies should be the silent counsellors during following Sundays.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Sales that Look Ahead</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In the rural districts they have the longer and in active days of the winter months and the message in permanent form is a way to occupy these long hours with some reading of lasting benefit. Studies in the Scriptures and Deliverance will be put into their bookcases, and will be referred to when people have little or nothing to do. It leaves the message in their homes in a permanent form. Of course, there will be times when only a sale of Deliverance and the booklet combination can be made; and the opportunity should be taken to place whatever literature can be placed, even though it be but a single booklet. Booklets lie about and get torn; and after the cover is mutilated they are thrown away with other papers. Bound volumes are kept for future reference. We urge the workers to give some thought to placing in the hands of the people the eight-volume combination at $2.73. The next four months of the year are the most seasonable for canvassing. We trust that the joy that you have, which seems to be increased by the greater number of people t-bat you talk with, will be the incentive for you to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">watch your time</span><span class="font2"> so that you might, during the next four months, call at a greater number of homes in the time that you can devote to the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With Christian greetings, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brethren in the service of our King, Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span></p>

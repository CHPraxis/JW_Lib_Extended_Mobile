<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>THE SPIRIT OF SERVICE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;And the spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah: and shall malre him of quick understanding in the fear of Jehovah.&quot;—Isa. 11:2,'3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">W</span><span class="font0">E 1)0 not need to remind readers of the Bulletin that the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ is one of service. He is the Messenger (servant) of the Covenant: he is the Messenger (servant) of Jehovah. He said,. <sup>f</sup>T am among you as he that serveth.” He has fulfilled his promise to ‘Tome forth and serve” his people with the meat in due season. He has girded himself with the girdle of servitude, as represented in the white linen girdle worn by Aaron the high priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The text not only shows that our Lord Jesus Christ has the holy spirit of his Father and our Father, but it shows of what that holy spirit consists. It will be noted that the text says nothing of Jesus’ sweet disposition. He did have such a disposition. All accounts reveal that fact. But one may have a sweet disposition and be of little or no service to the heavenly Father or to the cause with which he is identified.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Looking to Jehovah</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">The spirit which came upon our Lord Jesus is first of all a spirit of being willing to listen to his Father. This is indicated in every one of the five clauses of the text. He has the spirit of wisdom, knowing what to do; and he got it by revelation from his Father. He has the spirit of understanding. This is his own understanding of the knowledge he received from his Father; and as he is now and has always been perfect, his understanding of the Father's will is also perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our Lord has ths spirit of counsel, or advice; that is to say, he not only is willing to receive .counsel or advice from his Father, but prefers it to his own way. because, he has found that the Father’s way is the best of all ways. He has the spirit of knowledge. He wishes to know the Father’s will and way; and from time to time the Father grants fresh additions to his store of knowledge. He has in his heart the fear of the Father, and this fear makes him of quick understanding. All of these things are in the text.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Spirit of the Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">There is another tiling in the text, too. It says of Jesus that he. has the spirit of counsel and might, and it would be hard to think of a better definition of service than these two words. Jesus is willing, nay, eager, to receive counsel from the Father, in the Father’s way: and then he is eager, too, to do with his might what the Father wishes done. He is an ideal servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is a difference between working and working with might. To work with might means to be diligent in a work to get Tight after it with earnestness, industry and persistence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Diligence in canvassing will bring its own results. Even the poorest canvasser, if diligent, will make a certain proportion of sales, and with experience, assistance and advice can improve the percentage. But diligence is the one thing that no one can impart to another. It is a personal matter. It is a practical application of the consecration vow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How is it with us, brethren? Do we have all these things ? To whatever extent we have the holy spirit we do have them. The holy spirit, briefly but accurately defined, is a spirit of wanting to know God’s will and of doing the things he wishes done. We may get more of this spirit by asking for it. The Master promised this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">METHODS OF WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Letters such as the following are the most frequent kind that we are receiving:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Finished canvassing Waupaca for the fourth time. Sold more books this time than any time previous. Praise the Lord!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thanking you for all favors,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mbs. W. H. Speabbbakek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Clintonville,</span><span class="font0"> Wis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now it has been said by some that New Albany has been canvassed enough, and that it was impossible to do any more here. So we thought it might be well to try an experiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The poorest territory was selected, that is, a poor class of people, people that one would think, judging by the surroundings were in no position to buy books. It was in the neighborhood of a Methodist church, whose D. D. has opposed the Society for years and warned his flock to beware of the truth. Now in a little less than three hours we placed a5 hooks and booklets. This proves to me we have just begun the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">M. H. Hasp.—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New Albany, Ind.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Last Work Prepared for Present</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">These letters forecast better than anything else what results are in store for the summer canvassing. The territory that was canvassed last year for Studies in the Scbiptubes, sold a large amount of booklets. In most instances booklets are merely an opening wedge for the sale of the eight volumes. They enable people to become acquainted with the literature of the I. B. S. A. Booklets play an important part in preparing the territory for the next canvass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is one reason why we urge the workers to canvass for the eight-volume combination. If the territory is really prepared for this canvass, we are certain that great results are held in the territory; and we urge the workers to take advantage of the opportunity to place the literature in a permanent form in the people’s homes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The Radio Helping</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Another influence that has been exerting its strength in favor of the eight-volume combination is the radio. It is almost impossible to determine just how far-flung is the reception of the various stations. WBBR is being well received in different territories; and in instances where the worker associates the literature that they have with the lectures that are given over the air, good results are obtained. Workers in the vicinity of New York use the sentence, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font0"> represent Judge Rutherford, broadcasting from station WBBR.” This association is necessary to identify you; and.workers will find that it is an introduction that finds people already acquainted with you because they have heard the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The following is a report from a worker:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In canvassing one of the better homes the lady came to the door and excused herself, saying that it was supper time. I apologized, and seeing the radio from the door asked if she ever heard Judge Rutherford over the radio. “Yes,” she said. I told her I carried his book, Delivee-ance. “Come in, please,” she said, and ran to get the money. On showing her the set of Studies, she ordered that, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This lady said that she thought Judge Rutherford told the truth in regard to the outcome of the troublous conditions in the world in harmony with the Bible, and that she had longed for some of his books.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">-—Fond du Lac,</span><span class="font0"> Wts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It becomes more apparent that a canvass must manifest quite quickly that the workers have a different message than the churches. Something to distinguish it must be brought to the attention of the people canvassed, something that makes them appreciate that you represent the message that they have been wanting to investigate for some time. The following letter is a suggestion along this line, though quite pointed in its remark. Bat it has the same effect as did the slogan, “millions now living will never die.” Interest must be held from the beginning; and if you are identified with the movement you represent, interest is pretty well assured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An instance where Harp cards were sent by mistake found the party very anxious for the book that would answer the questions. A suggestion: A group of names might be selected to which the cards or lectures might be sent, and then the party canvassed. Another suggestion: In bringing canvass to a close when party has not decided to purchase, say, “If you are interested in the churches you will not care for this book, but if you are not interested in the churches you will waut it.” Recent experience has shown this to be good. Some pass ns by because they suppose that we are connected with the churches.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Introductions</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">It is along this line that mention of the radio station that is being picked up in the district quickly identifies you to the person called upon. Hence, if the radio station announced that this is WBBR, the Watchtower, or WORD the Watchtower, or some other station using the term I. B. S. A. or International Bible Students Association, workers will find it to their advantage to use such a phrase in identifying themselves to the person they are calling upon. Even in homes where radios are not installed some reference such as the following has been found advantageous :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I find that it pays to emphasize Judge Rutherford in the canvass as the friend of the people—a man who believes with all his heart that the Word of the Almighty is of greater consequence than all the theories of men you can stack up on ten acres; that he is' one of the few men we have that is big enough to leave off his own opinions and call attention to the Word of Jehovah God; that he is recognized the world over as the greatest living Bible student, and hence the great demand for his books in thirty languages, which are now dropping off from a single new press at the rate of twenty-two per minute, etc.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Workers Only Could Serve</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Since people generally are meeting with so much discouragement, and finding the churches of no help to them, they are naturally looking for the comfort that they must feel the Lord would bring to them. This, aside from the placing of literature, is the .service that the canvass the worker gives really is to the people. An example is the ministry such as is related in the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The lady who answered my call was crying. 1 asked her if she was in distress, informing her that it was our mission to bind up the broken-hearted and comfort those that mourn. She invited me in, ami between sobs told me her husband was in bed sick and had been lor two months. And her three little children were crying for bread. The Sunday before she had a chance to work for $1.00 and did so to buy bread for her hungry babies. The morning I called her minister (Methodist) had been there; and because she had worked on Sunday he threatened to turn her out of the church.—-For this reason she was crying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I asked her when he worked for his money. She said, “Sunday.'” And she told me he had refused to work or serve them until they paid him. When I told her he was a hypocrite and a servant of the Devil and had no right to condemn her for what he was doing himself, I soon had her laughing. After my canvass was over and I had placed in her hands the Harp of God, the Comfort for the People and the Hell booklet, I left her happy over the blessings for herself and her sick husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon visiting her two weeks later she told me she had ordered her name taken off the church book’.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Getting Preaching Heard</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Sunday canvassing is providing almost </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">new field for service. Those who are working write of the many blessings they are having. The results in the homes reached with the truth are greater in comparison with those attending a public meeting on Sunday. The message is brought to the attention of a much larger number of people, and is left in the hands of the people in a very permanent form. Blessings await those who have not engaged in this service, and the. summer months offer an excellent opportunity for such work. Testimony meetings following holiday canvassing parties that allow for picnic lunch and a testimony meeting or study at the end of the day is a means of refreshment better fitting one for the duties of the week. The following is a letter that tells of these blessings which are held in store for all workers. We trust that yon will soon be sharing the joy that is in this work:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will be necessary for me to do my canvassing in the evenings, Saturday afternoons and some on Sunday mornings. By past experiences I have learned that the best way for me to get out into the service work is to make a positive decision in my mind to devote a certain amount of hours per week to the kingdom work and then, put forth an honest effort to put that decision into action; and the Lord will invariably bless the efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I have been very timid about Sunday canvassing; but after reading in the Bulletins from time to time, about the experiences and blessings of others in Sunday work, 1 determined to try it this Sunday morning. So I jumped into the Ford with a supply of books and booklets, forty-two in all, and went out a few miles into a rural section among farmers, etc. In a few hours I had disposed of all the books I had. The places being quite scattered, I made only seven calls, and sold at every<sup>7</sup> one. In all I placed one full set of seven, three Deliverance, on? Harp, two Talking with the Dead, one Millions book, five Comfort, five Standard, five Desirable Government, five Hell, five Lord's Return, four Distress and five Zg’s. Ncedness to say, I came home rejoicing. At practically every place they simply drank in what I had to say, and then took the books without any questioning. To the Lord belong all credit and praise. Naturally I am not a salesman, but I do rejoice in this wonderful work.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>When Calling Again</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">With increased opportunities for service with each re-canvassing of territory holding for the workers better results, with the people that workers are calling upon already having a knowledge of the message, workers can by watching the time bring the new message and further literature to the people to a greater extent than heretofore. The better the conditions and the increased number of calls will, no doubt, show favorable results in each worker’s finding that he is making more individual sales than heretofore, placing more complete sets of Studies in the Scriptures, at $2.78.</span></p>

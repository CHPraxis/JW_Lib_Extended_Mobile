<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>THE DETERMINATION TO KEEP ON KEEPING ON</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Are not ye my work in the Lord? If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am- to you: for the seal of mine- apostleship are ye in the Lord. Mine answer to them that do examine ne is this; Have we not power to eat and drink? Have wc not power to lead about a sister, a tcife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?&quot;—1 Corinthians 9:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I</span><span class="font1">N THIS text the apostle was giving the church at Corinth some pretty plain talk, and some suggestions for their own welfare. that are not hidden very deeply beneath the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It seems that, like everybody of a worldly mind and like most professed Christians, the Corinthian brethren were inclined to think that if they did what everybody else did and lived in the way everybody else lived, that ' would be about the right thing and all that, could be reasonably expected of them. They , would be measuring up to the general standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is nothing new about that idea. That is one of the Devil’s pet schemes for getting God’s people to let up a little, at least, on the work which they are doing of breaking down his empire, or witnessing against it. It grieves him to have his kingdom disturbed. . The D'evil has two general lines of attack. One is to make it so hot for those who are active against him that they will be fearful to go on, and the other is to make some other path look much more reasonable and sensible and natural to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The apostle’s argument is that anybody can accumulate good things to eat and drink, anybody can get some kind of home together, almost anybody can get married, etc.; but because some of the Corinthian brethren were</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">talking about him behind his back, and he wanted to help them to be as loyal and zealous for the Lord and for His truth as he himself was, he took occasion to tell them a .few things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Long before he got to 'Corinth Paul could have stopped his strenuous life of making tents in the day and preaching the gospel at night; but if he had done so, how would his critics have gotten the truth ? He could have concluded that he &quot;had &quot;done his share” and married and &quot;settled down” and thenceforth done just enough to keep the other brethren from criticising him and saying he had gone out of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the apostle was a different type of mau. He was really consecrated to the Lord, using all his powers to the glory of the Lord’s name, and setting a splendid example to the Corinthians and to us to slack not our hands in the doing of what the Lord has given us to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At no time did the apostle slack his hand. His whole life was one of zeal and loyalty, spreading the gospel of the kingdom. He sacrificed all that he had, and all that any man would hold dear, in order that he might extend the good news to earth’s remotest bounds. He had no slack season. He “kept on keeping on” every month in the year, and every day, as far as he could arrange his affairs to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>METHODS OF WORK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">In n great measure the end of August sees the completion of summer work. We anticipate that September will see a slacking up of the work insofar as the amount of time that each worker can devote to the service is concerned. Yet it is a fact that not .only does the month of September show a decrease over the work of the summer months but it is one of the months that show the lowest point of activity throughout the year. This in a measure can be ■ arrested. Pressing household duties do not allow as much time for service, yet there are opportunities that allow for an hour or two hours’ work during the week. By this we mens, times during the week when an hour or two is available ; and if arrangements are such as to permit, workers can devote that time to service. We have asked directors to set aside territory that can be easily reached by the workers and to set it aside so that a party of workers can canvass the territory as a working party. But this needs the cooperation of the workers; and we </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">urge all who</span><span class="font1"> are engaging in the service to note to what extent they individually can keep the work during September more as it ought to be insofar asjinie devoted to the work is concerned.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Time for Year Reoort</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">September is the last month of the fiscal year of the Society, and we would like to see September keep pace with the other months of the year. The year 1927 has seen a slow-up in the amouut of sets sold. In this branch of the work particularly there is much room for improvement. The work of the summer has placed a number of booklets and combinations and these have worked in preparing territory for the placing of the set of volumes. It is generally after people hear of the truth that they wish all . the help that they can get; and in city territory that has, during the summer, been canvassed with combinations of booklets there is an excellent field for the placing of sets of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Reaches People Who Are Hurrying</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Making up time by employing methods such ns described In the following letter is the sort of work we are recommending workers to give particular attention to during the following month:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On account of being quite lame I cannot go out in the work much; so most of my canvassing is done right here at home, mostly at the well where passers-by stop for water for their horses, cars, etc. Since deciding to canvass for the set of ten, here is my record: I have canvassed five persons. One had no money and did not buy, but wanted to. Two bought </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font1"> saying that they would take the set of ten later. Two bought the set of ten, I found to my surprise and delight they buy the set of ten for $3.70 more quickly than they ever took the set of eight or nine. One can figure quickly by ten, especially when the price ends in a cypher. As soon as I tell the price, everyone says, “Why, only 37 cents a book! That’s very cheap,” etc. And they look at me as if they think I am surely making a mistake in stating the price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I canvass rapidly, because when people stop they want to get tlieir water and hurry on. So I have had to cut my canvass as short as possible. Very often they sit down on the well platform and stay an hour after I have aroused their interest.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Nearby Prospects</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The month of September brings a close to vacations in business and consequently reduces the time; but yet there are opportunities for service and occasions when books can be placed that-might in all probability have been overlooked for some time, for instance such as described in the following letter: ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I thought I would endeavor to spread the message at the office; but whom should I canvass? I could not canvass some, because it would be like casting precious things in the mire; so I started with the prominent mem-_ bers of the concern. As the result the Lord permitted me to place a set of seven volumes and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font1"> with the president, two vice presidents, chief engineer, pattern foreman, foundry superintendent, storekeeper, and a young lady in the office who was trying to revive the interest of a congregation that was growing “cold”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The one vice president was or is a very “good” Lutheran; and in the four years I had been working for him most of my work was for the church, as he was president of almost every society and branch of work connected with the church. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font1"> tried every way to bring in a discussion along the lines of the truth, but failed, until this drive week, when he said he would take a set for his son who was studying to become a Lutheran minister. I believe he is just starting out giving discourses. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was my privilege to be called back to the office last week to help out for two.days; and when this vice president came in and saw me at my desk he said, “Before I forget, can you get me another set of those books? I want to give them away for a Christmas present.” I assured him very willingly I could and would bring them the next time I came. Later on I wondered whose name I should put on the worker’s slip, so I went into his office to ask him. Here is the name he gave me: Rev.--, Elizabeth, N. J.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Combinations Include Sets</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Again we wish to emphasize that the method of work that needs attention in making up is the sale of nets of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font1"> and that it is the canvassing of territory that has already been reached that accomplishes this. Probably some suggestion as that contained in the following letter will enable you to sell sets easier. It is the set of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures </span><span class="font1">that we wish placed, whether in combination with or separate from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harp</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I will just say lately ! have been canvassing for the set of ten, all nt once: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harp, Deliverance,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Seven Volumes</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Jews,</span><span class="font1"> offering the full set of ten for $3.70. Then I drop down. I decided that if we expect much of the’ Lord, he will give us much; and I tried this three times, sold all ten once, nine once and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harp</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance </span><span class="font1">once. I can put in only about one hour or half an hour at a time. The three times mentioned above were these short periods I could put into the service. I was surprised to see that offering the full set of ten did not scare prospects at ail, but seemed to fill them with a desire to want all of them. I can canvass for the set of ten In seven minutes and include an introduction to the Jew book, too. Then one can drop dofrn to the booklets, as usual. . </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mbs.

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Words Millions Bear Weekly</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">We receive quite a number of letters such as the following; and uoting from them how nearly the worker came to losing the sale, we are prompted to urge again the mention of the Brother Rutherford or the radio or both in con-nectiou with canvasses. It has been the custom for some years to introduce yourself hy saying, “I am calling upon Christian people in this vicinity.” We urge that workers consider a a change by saying, “I represent Judge Rutherford, broadcasting over Station WBBR,” or, “I represent Watchtower, broadcasting over Station WORD”, or substituting the call letters of the station that serves the territory in which you are canvassing. If people can establish the identity of the person who is calling upon them, whom they represent and what they stand for, they will more quickly show their Interest in that which you are representing; and if from the beginning of your canvass you can talk with them on equal grounds, you are more assured of a sale. Note that again it was the set of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Studies</span><span class="font1"> that was placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the fourth of July we placed more books than on most other days. We used to think that those days (holidays) were an Inopportune time to approach people, but now we see that it was just Imagination. We continue to meet people who enjoy the radio programs of the I. B. S. A. One lady whom I canvassed on the Canadian border was looking favorably at the set. Toward the latter part of my remarks I mentioned that the radio connects the programs with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance book.</span><span class="font1"> She then said, &quot;Come right in. Those are the programs we have been enjoying this winter. My hnsband was thinking of sending for that book,” She &quot;bought a set of eight and thanked me for calling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A few blocks away another lady said she enjoyed the “drama&quot; representing several in a country store. Yesterday I canvassed a man in a town near here, mentioning the radio. At first he did not know whether he had heard it or not, hut Invited me In. On his record card of stations received he had WBBR marked down twice and WORD once. I called this to his attention and he said, “Oh, yes, the W atchtower station ! I hear tha t often. ” He bought a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font1"> without any further questions. Another lady bought a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance&quot; </span><span class="font1">because of having heard the programs over one of her neighbor’s radio sets. She appreciated them very much. Many others made similar. statements. Of all those who said they heard the station, not one made au unfavorable comment.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Radio Friends</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The influence of the radio can hardly be measured adequately; and since it is awakening interest we urge workers to take advantage of that Interest, for where the radio has awakened interest to read it is an essential part of our work to supply that interest with the books and booklets that people want:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This noon I was delivering a booklet to a colored woman who lived near the railroad. I went to her back door and gave her the book. An engine was standing on the track nearby. The eugiueer and the fireman called to me, asking what I had. I had only a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hell </span><span class="font1">and a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lord’s Return</span><span class="font1"> booklet in my hand; but I answered, “Bible hooks.” They asked the price and, when I told them, said to bring them over. One of the men climbed down and gave me the money for the two booklets. He asked If these were Christian Science or Adventist books; and I told him, “No. International Bible Students Association:” But this did not seem to be familiar, so I asked him if he had ever heard judge Rutherford, or Station WORD. He brightened up and said, “Yes.” He was much pleased. I was very sorry I did not have more books with me; but as they were all ready to back up I did not have time to return to the street and get some more books from my car.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Getting in from Cold Weather</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The following letter makes a recommendation that is worth taking advantage of hy all workers in order that you may be known hy your work. Canvassing will be more difficult as the weather becomes colder and as the stormy period of the year is more prevalent throughout the country. The introduction that you are representing a radio station or the Watchtower broadcasting over a radio will readily gain for you admittance to the house when you are not able to stand on a doorstep or remain out in the cold. Workers should moke an endeavor to gain admittance to homes, as this will materially assist the work during the coming winter and especially Saturday and Sunday. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Just a few lines regarding canvassing large apartment houses. I have as a rule done better in them than in the usual run of city . houses. In tlie latter the lady of the house is often upstairs and opens the window and calls below, thus making it necessary to talk with bended neck to the regions above. In the apartment houses the lady or man usually comes to the door and, seeming to feel a freedom from the neighbor’s gaze, is usually more inclined to talk. Apartment houses are warm in winter, cool in summer, and dry on rainy days. In tact, in winter I usually save them for stormy and extremely cold weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About entering: If the door is unlocked jnst walk right in as you would if you were calling on a friend, asking no questions and walking to the top floor and working down. This is better than working up as, after gaining your breath, it is easy to walk down without hesitation. Then, too, if one starts on the first floor he is apt to meet the superintendent in his apartment, in which case all is ended. If the door is locked, press one of the middle bell-buttons and then another till door opens. Never press a top or bottom button till the last, as you may ring the superintendent’s bell. Sometimes buttons are reversed, so that the top one rings the superintendent’s bell. If no bell is answered, wait a few minutes and likely some tenant may enter or leave, in which case it is easy to slip in. It you should happen to be accosted by the superintendent, just Sake it as a matter of course, canvass him. and ask for permission to go through the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another advantage iu apartments is that there tire usually from four to eight on a floor, so that all one has to do is to swing on the heel, take a few steps, and .the next door is reached. Do not forget the superintendent or janitor after canvassing the tenants. Frequently they buy the hooks. I always look for them even if their rooms are in the basement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, in the ultra-fashionable apartment houses, where a page meets the caller at the door, there may be some difficulty. In these cases n.s)&lt; tor the superintendent (never the &quot;janitor”), canvass him and ask for permission to go through. He may at least allow us to ride up the hack way and canvass at the servants’ quarters on the way down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus it is seen that while it is our privilege and duty to canvass all, there is no real reason to feel timid about entering apartment houses. With a little more trust in the Lord and a little less fear of man, which bringeth a snare, much can be accomplished. The worst that may happen is that we may be politely asked to desist, in which case, after having done all, we gracefully bow to the will of the Lord.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Resolution Distribution</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">October has been set aside for the distribution of the Resolution passed at Toronto and the lecture that was broadcast in the nation-wide hookup. The September 15th </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font1"> has announced the publication of this message in booklet form to be sold to the public at five cents each. The Letter of Instructions to - Directors has outlined the procedure to be followed in this distribution. The campaign is to be started Saturday, October 1st, and pushed strenuously . during the entire month of October. A canvass will be necessary in order to place the booklet. Many Intel rested listeners will be found who heard the lecture over the radio. Many of these will want Judge Rutherford’s books. Therefore we urge a..special canvass during the month of October fee the dollar combination which will place the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harp of God. Deliverance, Restoration </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Desirable Government</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Where are the Dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have asked directors to assign workers- to the same territory the£ have canvassed early in the year. You will likely remember what was placed in the way of books and booklets in the different homes you canvassed. As yon come with the booklet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples,</span><span class="font1"> to a home in which you have placed other books, offer to the occupants of the house the- set of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures.</span><span class="font1"> If you know that they<sup>7</sup> have all of the books that are published by the Society, offer a copy of the book, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Restoration. Restoration</span><span class="font1"> is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the.Jews</span><span class="font1"> in a different cover, making It suitable for Gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The work during October should be done in a quick and rapid fashion, The message, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom, for the Peoples,</span><span class="font1"> is the principal work. It Is to be distributed widely. This booklet is to be placed in the hands of as many people as possible. The rural districts are a most promising field; for the winter months will find the farmers with much time on their hands for rending and studying the message. We have recommended to directors that they plan as many drives as possible for short-period drives in the rural setions so that this territory may be reached while the good weather continues and then complete the work by following up activities in the larger towns. The work will be urgent and pressing, and since interest is maintained in proportion to the up-to-date-ness of the message, a quick distribution of the booklet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples</span><span class="font1"> should be pushed as strenuously as possible, so as not to be too long after the radio hookup, and particularly while the general trend of the message is still in' the minds of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Keep in close touch with the director. Obtain assignments of territory for an hour’s or half an honr’s work when such amounts of time are available. W’e urge that you cooperate closely • so that this message will be distributed as widely and as completely as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Assuring you of our continued interest and with Christian greetings, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your brethren in the service of our King, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span></p>

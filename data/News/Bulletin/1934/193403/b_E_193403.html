<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">March 24-April 1 Time for Concentrated Action</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1,000,000 Quota for U. S. A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial, Convention, Chain Hookup, Brother Rutherford’s Lecture,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dividing the People,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Anointed Must Act!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Rutherford’s letter addressed to the anointed and enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> sets out clearly the importance and significance of this special period of thanksgiving for Jehovah’s witnesses, Read this letter carefully before going any further, as it is of utmost importance to the anointed. After you have thoroughly considered what is therein set out we feel sure that your mind will have been made up that you will have some part in witnessing with the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People.</span><span class="font3"> To make this the greatest witness yet on earth to Jehovah’s name would mean to increase the testimonies given. Every arrangement is made for this increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let’s jump to Los Angeles, Calif. There preparation for a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses is well under way. Everyone who can possibly attend will do so, for it is an assembly of the Lord’s people. In Los Angeles and vicinity there arc approximately three million people who will be called on during the convention which begins March 23 and ends with the Memorial, Each morning is set aside for the distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing Ike People,</span><span class="font3"> and on Sunday, March 25, Is the public meeting. Can you imagine that Shrine Auditorium packed to capacity, 8,000 persons, and the overflow meeting? What a thrill to he at either of these places! By the Lord’s grace Brother Rutherford there stands before this large audience, addressing not only them, but at the same time his voice is •tarried over a chain of radio stations that will reach all parts of North America and, we hope, other countries. This in itself, the start of this testimony period, is a tremendous witness and testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Such a beginning for the Thanksgiving period, whether you can be at the convention or not, should be cause enough for everyone to want to have a part in singing forth the praises of the only true God. Then, in the middle of the week, in the evening of Wednesday, Marell 28, is the Memorial. All of Jehovah’s witnesses, wherever they may be, will at that time partake of the Memorial supper. This will be all the more appreciated after five days of extraordinary effort in the field service. Then follow four days to continue in the most tremendous campaign ever organized. As Brother Rutherford says in his letter, “the tenth plague is the death of the firstborn of Satan’s organization, and is near at hand. Before that expression of Jehovah’s wrath, the anointed MUST ACT.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For this concentrated action every preparation has been made. For several months now the factory at Brooklyn has been turning out by the thousands the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People.</span><span class="font3"> As this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> goes to press more than 4,000,000 of these booklets have been printed and are on steamships or railroad trains going to every corner of the world. Baek into the jungles of Africa, into the big cities of civilized nations, into every nook and corner where there is one representing Jehovah as his witness, these booklets are now on their way, so that the people of good will may be aided in this day to take their stand on the side of Jehovah. Translations are being sped up so that this same message of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font3"> can be had in other languages. The Arabic, Icelandic, Slovak, Ukrainian, and Spanish are already set in linotype form, and in a few weeks will be ou tile press, and these will be on their way to other countries. Branches all over the world are putting forth, every effort to get either this booklet or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom </span><span class="font3">into the hands of Jehovah’s witnesses so that an intense campaign can be carried on in their own countries. Bulletins in every language are being prepared, and .Brother Rutherford’s letter is being translated into all tongues, so that this comforting letter to the anointed may. reach them before this Thanksgiving Period. To one isolated it may seem that it is just a small work being accomplished; but remember that when all ot' the individual reports from every corner of the globe come in, and when they are added together, the total w’ill run into the millions, A year ago, in the United Slates alone there were over 20,000 workers engaging in the field service, and these gave over 2,200,000 testimonies. This was an unprecedented witness, and resulted in placing over 875,000 pieces of literature, Surely this and even more! can be done, for it is Jehovah that I will give the increase. If we con-! sider just for a moment how many one must pliice to make a quota of a million, you will find that it is not difficult; however, it will require time, but with the use of the testimony card your energy will be conserved and a united witness will be given. For example; If 1,800 pioneers place 175 booklets each, that would make 315,000; 800 auxiliaries, 100 each, would be 80,000; other workers, 35 each, would make 647,-500. There we have it, a total of 1,042,500 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font3"> booklets in only 9 days. That for the United States. Other countries will have their own quotas. Those of the remnant will aid their Jonadab brethren in carrying on tills work by furnishing them with testimony cards, literature and territory. So the work will increase until it has tilled the whole earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is very evident from the message the Lord brings to his people through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> that we have come to the time when the remnant must be in unity. “Christ Jesus is the Head of Jehovah’s capital organization, and it is always the head that directs the operations of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the body. He</span><span class="font3"> stated that when he appeared for judgment he would be accompanied by his angels, which angels carry out his orders. Without doubt these angels are delegated by the Lord to convey liis instructions to the members of his organization on earth. Just how this is done is not necessary for us to understand. Believing that Christ Jesus is directing the. work on earth, then we must conclude that the visible ones put in certain positions in God’s organization are there by his will and must render account to him; otherwise they would be removed. Over the entire organization is Jehovah; and as Jehovah and Christ are one, so likewise must all the organization be one. If one in the organization receives directions, and those directions come through the place designated to give instructions, then the instructions should he obeyed as unto the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Jehovah will not do his great art in secret, but openly, and notice must be served concerning the same, and the obligation is upon the faithful remnant to serve such notice. This is not merely an optional privilege, but an absolute command, and a failure or refusal to obey the same means destruction of the witnesses. To obey organization instructions is not discretionary, but entirely mandatory. In the organization of Jehovah it matters not whether yon are a pioneer, auxiliary, company worker, printer, dishwasher or president of the Society ; all are one and all subject to the head Christ Jesus. The Lord is no respecter of persons, but everyone is required to perform his </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">as</span><span class="font3">signed duty,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The foregoing are citations from the article “His Organization”, which clearly indicates the course of action the remnant must follow at this time. It tills course of action is followed out during this special period, everyone looking to the Lord and doing his part faithfully, there is not a question of doubt regarding the blessed results of the effort put forth ; for the work will be done absolutely under the direction of Jehovah through his organization.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2,416,141 Sign Protest and Petition</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">This Work a Real Joy to the Remnant</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are sure you will be interested . to learn about the results of the 1’BOTKST AND PETITION Work. The brethren in the United States entered into this special work with much enthusiasm and carried it on through the middle of winter, when some of the worst weather this country has had in years was encountered. The Lord has greatly blessed our efforts; for, in addition to tlie large number of signers obtained on the petition, the month of December was the biggest December we ever had in the distribution of books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">January 15 was set as the final date for the petition forms to be sent in. About the middle of the previous week they began to eome in in large quantities, and continued to increase until Monday, January 15, when there was so much mail that tlie postmen were wondering what it. was all about. There were stacks and stacks of petition sheets filled out, and most of the office force of the Society worked day and night till 9:30 pan. for nearly a week, counting and sorting the signatures. By 8:30 p.m. Monday, January 22, the petitions were all wrapped up in packages for presentation to Congress. The grand total was 2,416,141.; and included in this number were signers from every congressional district in the United States except one, also 896 names from i he Territory of Hawaii. The petition packages were delivered to tlie various members of Congress on Wednesday, January 24, and we are now' looking forward to the reaction it will have on Congress and the other parties concerned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Not Far Behind That</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Million-a-Month Idea</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The table above shows the work done during the first three months of tile fiscal year 1933-34, that is, October, November and December, 1933. So that you can see the phenomenal increase over last year, there is a comparison made below with the same period of 1932-33. This report is for the United States and fifteen outlying territories under the Brooklyn office.' You will rejoice as you examine the table and see the increase in the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wobkebs: Although 5 fewer pioneers and 80 fewer auxiliaries reported than during the year previous, there was ah increase of 3,686 in the number of company workers. The average total of 18,190 monthly workers is an increase of 3,601 over that of the preceding year. The number of workers should continue to grow as more and more awaken to their privileges and take their stand for Jehovah. It is hoped that due consideration is being given the auxiliary work. Can you arrange your time by the Thanksgiving Period so ns to he an auxiliary?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The outstanding' featube of the work during the past quarter la Jehovah’s rich blessing upon the tise of the printed testimony; the exceedingly large number of placements of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font3"> as well as of booklets, the larger number of workers enabled to take part and to devote more time to the service, the tremendous increase in the total number of testimonies given and the number of testimonies and obtainers per hour, and the fewer testimonies given per obtainer, all prove the effectiveness of this method of giving the witness and show the Lord’s manifest blessing upon those who have carried on the work in this</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Consignment of Special</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Folders</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Five million</span><span class="font3"> special radio folders are being printed for the purpose of informing the people of the nationwide coast-to-coast broadcast by Brother Rutherford from Los Angeles, Calif., Sunday, March 25. Already arrangements are under way whereby all the companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries in the United States can join in distributing these folders to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Consignments of these folders will soon be shipped direct to tire service directors of the English companies, to the sharpshooters, and to the pioneers and auxiliaries located in isolated territory. This means that the colored and the foreign-language companies, pioneers and auxiliaries located in English company territory are to arrange to obtain their folders from the service director of the English company; for they will not receive direct consignments. Also, the pioneers and auxiliaries located in the same town as the sharpshooter are to obtain their folders from the sharpshooter, to whom they will be sent. Pioneers are being allotted 680 of these radio folders, and the auxiliaries 340. These brethren should apply for their allotments accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Service directors and sharpshooters should promptly notify all the brethren in their assignment of the receipt of these folders, so that they may obtain their supply and place them in the hands of the people as soon as possible. This folder distribution should be in conjunction with the field witness work and should not interfere with your field activities. Evenings, particularly, should be devoted to this work. All the folders should be distributed by Sunday noon March 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Los Angeles Convention </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Thousands Will Attend This Service Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is undoubtedly a great blessing in store for those who can attend a convention of Jehovah's witnesses, which is already arranged for, beginning on the evening of March 23 and including the Memorial on March 28. The place is Los Angeles, Calif. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font3"> IVatclitoirer has made announcement of where the meetings will be held, and we hope that everyone who can possibly do so will have the privilege of attending this convention. The special features of the convention, are the large public meeting which will be aildressed by Brother Butherford, the address to be broadcast over a eoast-to-coast network, and the distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People </span><span class="font3">during the forenoon of each day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are approximately three million people living within a radius of fifty miles of Los Angeles, and it is hoped that during these live days every one of these people will be duly informed of the public meeting as well as have the opportunity of obtaining the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For rooming accommodations and any other information regarding your stay in Los Angeles communicate with C. V. Knemeyer, 3345 Fern wood St., Lynwood, Calif. For those who cannot attend the entire convention, it is well to boar in mind that many of the railroads and bus companies make special weekend rates, and such tickets are good from Friday night to Monday midnight. It would be a good thing for each one in the vicinity of Los Angeles to investigate this matter and make every effort to attend this convention.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>New Spring-wound Transcription Machine</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Operated from 6-Volt Storage Battery</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is now manufacturing at Brooklyn a new spring-wound portable transcription machine, and, due to the saving that can be effected by buying material in large quantities, and other economies, we are now enabled to place this ma-cliine with the brethren for $100.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tills machine is highly recommended. It is really more desirable and effective than the all-electric because it can be used anywhere and under any circumstances and is not dependent upon electric current or any external power for its operation. It is designed to operate entirely from a six-volt storage battery, which can be recharged from AC 60-eycle electric current. The battery is packed separately from the ma chine, which consequently reduces the weight considerably. It has a wide range of amplification and is very clear in its reproduction of voice and music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The machine, exclusive of the battery, weighs 85 pounds. The battery is separate, anil weighs 43 pounds. The dimensions of the machine are 23 x 17J x 14J inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A battery charger' and a hydrometer for testing the battery are supplied with, each machine. The only electric current necessary is for recharging the battery, and tills may be done at home, in a garage, or anywhere where AC GO-cycle electric current is available. Full instructions covering the operation of the machine and the care of the battery will accompany each machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Released for Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance,</span><span class="font3"> containing Brother Rutherford’s Plainfield (N.J.) address on “Religious Intolerance: Why” and the radio lecture “Value of Knowledge and Understanding”, is now released for distribution. This booklet will not he used for any special testimony pei'iod, but may be distributed in your regular witness work as soon as received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No consignments will be made bf </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance;</span><span class="font3"> so place your order now, along with such other literature as you may require.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Just ahead or us is favorable weather, with greater privileges and opportunities of carrying the Kingdom message to the people.

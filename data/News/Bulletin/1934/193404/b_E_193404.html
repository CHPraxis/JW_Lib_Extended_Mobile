<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Chain Broadcast Heard in Many Parts of the Earth</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Brethren Greatly Enthused</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">The early reports are coming In on the international &quot;Thanksgiving Testimony of Jeliovali’s witnesses” and they show that again the anointed ot' the Lord have put forth another extraordinary effort to honor his mime. What the results of this period will be we cannot now state, but we can say that it surely lias been a most blessed week for all of those who love and know Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The world-wide chain broadcast of Sunday, March 25, is now history, This message was the most thrilling and forceful ever delivered before’ a visible and an invisible audience. Brother Rutherford seemed to be at his best. His delivery was clear and the message of the Lord : which he had the privilege of hurl-ing to the world was most thrilling. Shortly after the broadcast cables and telegrams came from all corners of the earth. We were informed from Cape Town, South Africa, that many telegrams had been received at the branch office there, and that the reception was excellent for both sjieeches given by Brother Rutherford. A cable was received from Australia expressing the unity of tbe brethren, in their crying out &quot;Aye” to the resolutions, i'rorii Europe word was received that it came through. Mexico on the south, Canada on the north, as well as every state in the Union, heard this warning of certain death of the entire organization of the Devil. Not only did millions of people throughout the world hear this lecture by radio, but before the speaker there were assembled 8,000, crowding out the Shrine Auditorium, and 4,000 in two other auditoriums which were used for overflow meetings. Brother Rutherford received a thrilling ovation when he appeared on the platform, and there was rapt attention to every word of his discourse. It is marvelous how silent a great multitude of people can be when deeply interested. Reports -were received that it was thrilling to watch the intense interest on the part of the audience. Those who were privileged to hear these speeches and resolutions will never forget them. The definite declaration was made that the world is sick unto death and will not recover. The notice was served upon Satan and his organization and they refused to accept it, and that the Lord’s people were how to definitely turn to the instruction and preparation of those people of good will who desire the Lord’s protection in the day of God Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Words are wholly inadequate to describe the wonderful privilege accorded the Lord’s people during this special period. All the anointed were honored in having some part in the Los Angeles convention. They heard the lectures “WORLD CONTROL” and “REQUIREMENTS” and enjoyed witnessing in the field. In bringing about closer unity throughout the world the Lord provided every company who had a .transcription machine with the lecture “REQUIREMENTS”, which many expressions from alt parts of this country show was greatly appreciated. Early in the preparation of this campaign a special letter was written by Brother Rutherford setting out the importance of the work, and particularly making the statement that &quot;nine of the plagues that fell upon Egypt either have been anti-typically fulfilled or are now in course of fulfilment. The rulers of the world have received notice and warning and have failed to give heed. The tenth plague is the death of the firstborn of Satan’s organization, and is near at hand. Before that expression of Jehovah’s wrath the anointed must act”. This whetted the appetite of Jehovah’s witnesses for an understanding of the ten plagues. The Lord graciously provided this understanding through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> before the international Thanksgiving Testimony period began. This food from the Lord’s table was a comfort to the brethren and an aid to them to press forward. Additionally, there was provided a testimony in many languages, and this printed on a card, making it possible for the workers to call on all peoples and tongues. The early results of the first two days of the period show that 1,935 workers placed 23,805 booklets. If the company workers kept up that average they should have placed between 500,000 and 600,000 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font3"> booklets during the week. No reports have been received from the pioneers and auxiliaries. We feel sure an extraordinary effort on their part has been made. As soon as a complete report is received, the information will be tabulated and published in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Companies, sharpshooters, and isolated brethren throughout the country should forward their Memorial report to this office as soon as possible. The information may be included with the report of the “Thanksgiving Testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How Soon Shall We Have 1,000 Auxiliaries and 2,000 Pioneers Reporting Monthly?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>We Hope It’s in April</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">The manner in which brethren throughout the land are responding, to the opportunities and privileges in the pioneer and auxiliary service has been observed with great interest. Speaking of the need for more auxiliaries, the February </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> asked, “Will there be 1,000 enrolled by Memorial time?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Memorial day finds a total of 994 appointed to serve as auxiliaries, 1,996 commissioned to serve as pioneers; 2,990 in all. Not the largest number ever enrolled at one time, but a marked increase; and not all the questionnaires sent out have been returned. Both the pioneer and the auxiliary list should continue to grow, and we are confident that there are many more brethren now serving as sharpshooters and company workers who can arrange to meet auxiliary or pioneer time requirements. As you know, auxiliary time is at the very least 52 hours a</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>“IN HIS NAME</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SHALL THE NATIONS HOPE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Every effort is to</span><span class="font3"> lie </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">made to reach the riirnlx</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the winter months Jehovah’s witnesses have been putting forth strenuous efforts, which is pleasing to the Lord because they have been proving their integrity and their loyalty to him and his organization. In many places the company workers have gone over their city territory four or five times in the last several months because it was necessary to do it thus. Some territory has been reached with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> and then for petition signatures, then with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font3"> and then with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People,</span><span class="font3"> and again with the McFadden Bill and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance,</span><span class="font3"> This, of course, was done for the purpose of reaching the largest number of people In the least time. With this special work throughout the hardest winter months a marvelous witness has heen given to the honor of Jehovah's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now spring has come and the roads are getting better, and it is possible for the company workers, auxiliaries and pioneers to work their rural districts and small outlying towns with greater facility. Many of these people will be overjoyed with the prospects of obtaining the new hook, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation, </span><span class="font3">which went so splendidly in its month; pioneer time, at the very least 110 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why should this time of thanksgiving and memorial to Jehovah’s name be an especially appropriate season for each to diligently consider what he can do to get into the pioneer or auxiliary service? The Lord’s true covenant people have properly kept the symbolic memorial feast. Thus they showed forth that they are continually having an active personal part in participating in proclaiming the message of God in connection with the plagues upon Satan’s organization before the death of the firstborn of antitypical Egypt. The members of the remnant have this active personal part as pioneers, auxiliaries, company workers and isolated witnesses. Each one, therefore, will be diligent to see that his active personal part in proclaiming the Kingdom message is just as large as possible, and will not be satisfied with service as a company worker'if the auxiliary requirements can be met, or auxiliary service if pioneer time can be spent in house-to-house witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The office is very happy to cooperate with the brethren to this end and to hear from all desiring to join the pioneer or auxiliary ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">first week. What has been true of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font3"> in the United States has been true all over the world, and this book should be offered throughout your territory between the special testimony periods, along with the newer booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance, Dividing the People, Escape to the Kingdom;</span><span class="font3"> and, of course, in every place where more than one clothbound book ean be placed every effort should be made to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many opportunities will be offered for the use of the transcription machines : in little parks, country schoolhouses, and even on persons’ farms they may be congregated, and in these places the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font3"> book and other literature can be offered. Great is the privilege of the anoint-' ed to bring to the attention of the nations of the earth that their only hope is in Jehovah’s name and taking a definite stand on his side.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Five Months’ Transcription Machine Report</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">407,520 Have Attended the Meetings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Spring and Summer Should Find an Increase in Attendance</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep the Machines Busy</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Transcription machine reports from the field show clearly that to the extent the brethren have followed the instructions outlined in fow U’or/v </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">with Transcription Machines</span><span class="font3"> they have been blessed In their efforts and have accomplished an effective witness. February closes the first five months of this fiscal year, and yon will be glad to have shared in the total work for this five-month period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The largest number of machines for which reports were received during any one month Is 388, including not only the United States, but also the Bahamas, the Canal Zone, Costa Rica, and Cuba. A total of 11,521 meetings have been held since last October, at which 17,000 lectures have , been run. The attendance at these meetings averages about 35, a grand total of 407,520 having been reported. Considerable literature has been placed at meetings, 4,421 books and 24,825 booklets, making a total of 29,266 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There have been 21 weeks in the five months ending with February. The total number of meetings averages 548 a week, or an average less than 1J meetings for each machine in use. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Your Work with Transcription Machines</span><span class="font3"> states, “These machines should be used regularly</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Notice to All Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are in receipt of a. number of complaints from the Post. Office Department regarding the Society's printed matter being placed in mail boxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fact that this is contrary to the postal regulations has been called to the attention of the brethren repeatedly. Wo are hereby asking each service director to bring this to the attention of the brethren again. It is contrary to the postal regulations to place anything in mail boxes unless it is stamped and properly comes through the mail. It will save considerable trouble all around if this requirement is observed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Records and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren who have charge of transcription machines, please note: When transcription records are broken or become so worn that they cannot be used any more, they should NOT be returned to the Society, but destroyed locally. Then ask for replacements, and we shall be glad to supply thens. It is a wasteful expense to send these records back here; for they cannot be used again, and are liable to get mixed in with the good records and cause other brethren to have the same trouble you are experiencing now when they are reshipped to them. Also, all correspondence having to do with portable transcription machines should show the serial number and the type of machine, whether electric or spring-wound, and whether it was received from the Sound Systems, Inc., or from the Society at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn. This will aid greatly in our cooperation wilt) you regarding your portable transcription machines, at least twice a week. Saturday and Sunday evenings are excellent times, especially in small towns where country folk congregate. In larger cities in certain districts they should be used during the week at least once in addition to Saturday and Sunday.” Thus it is seen that those who have transcription machines should not be content with putting on merely two meetings a week, but as many more as possible. If the 388 machines for which reports have been received had been used even twice a week there would have been a total of 16,296 meetings for the five-month period, and, with the same average, the total attendance would have been 570,360; more than 100,000 per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been emphasized that tho brethren must arrange their transcription service so that it will not interfere with their house-to-house work, but rather be in addition to their regular door-to-door witnessing. This is very important, aud especially is it necessary that pioneers and auxiliaries continue to get in their full quota of hours in addition to transcription work. The Society provides announcement slips to be used in advertising transcription lectures. That this advertising can be carried on without interfering with the door-to-door witnessing is shown by reports we have received from pioneers and others. Regarding this, one brother has written, “For the 1,100 attendants we have had this month at meetings, we spent no time in advertising, in our house-to-house -witnessing when we meet interested persons, if possible, we, arrange with them to hold meetings at their home, church,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Catalogue</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A newly revised edition of the catalogue is now being prepared and will be ready for distribution in a few -weeks. This new catalogue will contain descriptions of all of the current books and booklets written by Brother Rutherford, including </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation, Intolerance</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People..</span><span class="font3"> A beautiful three-color display of these books and booklets will be found in We center. Additionally, a brief description of the Watch Tower organization, its aims and purposes, as well as the extent of its activities, is given. These catalogues will be supplied to the brethren as heretofore at the cost of production, which is two of them for 5c. lu quantities of 50 or more, to one address, 2c each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Stamp Transcription Announcements </span><span class="font3">Some brethren have written this office advising that some of thoir transcription audience were disappointed when they found Brother Rutherford was not personally present at the meeting, the people seemingly getting, the impression from the invitation that Brother Rutherford would be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The initial supply of invitation slips which were printed did not make the fact clear that this was an electrical transcription. Therefore, it will be in order for every company that is encountering any difficulty in this respect to print; along with the place of meeting, that “this is an electbicat. tbaw-scription”. Subsequent printings of these announcements will contain tills information. school, or what-have-you, and let them advertise it among their friends. Many times, too, the teacher, deacon or preacher will arrange it. This leaves us free to put in all our time in the house-to-house work.” Kot only may the announcement slips be handed out by the brethren themselves, but a supply may be furnished to those interested parties for them to pass out among their friends,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We wish to call your attention to the fact that the transcription programs are like pouring oil on troubled waters. They spread from one community to the uext and cause .the humiliation of the opposers. An appreciative attendance at a transcription meeting furnishes the refreshing, and we are ready for the next day’s door-to-door work. We. find that these lectures spread friendly feeling and tend to break down old prejudices.” A machine was used In... a New England village, and tlie worker reports, “The next day and for days after the lecture the people wanted to know if we were connected with those lectures that were being put on. When they found out that we were, nearly every home in tho town welcomed us and contributed to the work and got some books and booklets. It- seemed to make no difference -whether the people were Catholic or Protestant or did not belong to anything. Thus tho work continued throughout the township.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another place where machines have been used with good success is in various “missions”, especially in the larger cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some report the number of records run during the month under the heading “Number of Let-lures Run”, Tlie information desired under this heading on the report card is not the number of records that have been run, but tlie number of lectures given. Thus, if one lecture is on two or more records it would be reported as one lecture </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">each lime given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Noon Hours and Book Illustration</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A suggestion has been received from the field which is especially interesting to those working in factory territory. Permission is obtained from the factory office to go through the shop during the noon hour. Typewritten copies of the testimony are fastened with paper clips outside the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font3"> booklets which are handed out to the employees with the request for them to read the testimony. After distributing the booklet to all on one floor, the worker goes around again for the contributions or to collect the booklets. It is stated that in this way a large factory can be covered in a half-hour period and the results are good. One worker says, “Most of the time I have placed as many booklets during that half-hour as during the rest of the day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the back of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font3"> booklet the bound books arc beautifully shown. This attractive illustration is being used to good advantage by pioneers and others in calling attention to the books. This should assist, not only at the time of placing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People,</span><span class="font3"> but also when going over territory in which the booklet has already been placed. Some people who believe they have all the books find upon examining the picture on the booklet cover that they do not have them all, and are anxious to com plete their set.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Good News</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Estonia</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Several ‘Jona dabs’ here are taking part in spreading </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> and have become subscribers for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> One of these is deaf and dumb, but has been able by means of the Testimony card provided by the Society to place about sixty copies In a few hours. Another got over two hundred copies and was glad to receive instructions and Testimony cards.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">British Isles</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So far this year our brethren in the British Isles have more than doubled the amount of literature placed compared with the same period last year. The first four months last year they distributed 449,524 pieces of literature, and the first four months this year, 1,065,756. That is an increase of over 600,000. The number of workers has also in- . creased from 4,103 to 4,427. Surely the Lord Is wonderfully blessing their efforts to magnify his name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Ireland</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Recently a special effort was made to deliver the Kingdom message in the Irish Free State. 100,000 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and Purgatory</span><span class="font3"> were mailed to the inhabitants of that country, mostly Catholic, and it has evidently greatly roused the ire of the Catholic clergy. It has been reported that in some parts bonfires were made of the booklets collected in tho various towns, and now the clergy are trying to get the government to interfere with our literature’s passing through the mail. The following is an excerpt from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Irish Times</span><span class="font3"> of February 1:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Pbopaganda by Post. The minister for posts and telegraphs, replying to Mr. R. Anthony, who asked if his attention had been drawn to the circulation through the post in Cork, city and elsewhere in the Irish Free State of an Antichristian pamphlet during the month of January, 1934; and, if so, if he would state what steps he proposed to take to prevent a recurrence of the distribution of such blasphemous prop- ■ agarida through the post, stated that the answer to the first part was in the affirmative. At present, however, there were no powers under which the Post Oilice eon’ci take action. As regards the second part, the matter was under consideration.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Jamaica</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The branch manager in Jamaica reports that 15 transcription lectures were held in .January, with a total attendance of 3,650. Following is an excerpt from his report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The masses are showing much appreciation for the lectures. It is only from the ruling element that opposition comes, especially from the Roman Catholic section; they are using every means to hinder and disrupt. We are receiving many requests for transcription lectures from tlie public and it seems there are favorable opportunities ahead for the two transcription machines at our disposal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ordering Literature for the Blind</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When requesting literature for tho blind as a loan, be sure to give the name of the blind person' for whom it is requested, as the postal law requires that literature for the blind be sent in the name of a blind person in order to go through the mail free. It may be sent in care of anyone to any address, but the name of a blind person must appear in the address. When writing concerning literature for tlie blind, direct your communications to Watch Tower' Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, 1210 Spear St., Logansport, Ind.</span></p>

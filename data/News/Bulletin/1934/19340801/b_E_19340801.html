<p><span class="font1">The first nine months of the fiscal year have gone. Jehovah’s witnesses during that period of time have put forth a sti’enuous effort in their endeavor to advertise the King and Kingdom, ft is very encouraging to note that now there is an average of IS,323 pioneers, auxiliaries, company workers, and sharpshooters engaging in the witness work. Comparing this with the previous year we find that it is an increase of 2,550 workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The details of the activity of these faithful workers is set out in this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font1"> and it is well for each individual to realize that this witness could be given only by the Lord’s protection in the day of his preparation. It is encouraging to note that at the end of nine months there has been an increase in the distribution of hound books to the extent of 58,901. The booklets show a splendid increase, namely, 730,086. With this total increase of 788,987 it brings the total nine months’ distribution of 1934 to 7,192,754.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Millions of homes throughout the United States have been called on. To date 18,691,227 persons have heard the testimony’ by reading it on the printed card or orally. These people now know of Jehovah’s kingdom, and of this tremendous total approximately one-third of them obtained literature. It. is marvelous in our eyes to see how the Lord is blessing his people by giving them strength and zeal even in these times of great persecution on the part of Satan’s organization. Every effort is being made to hinder the work and .to make it difficult to carry on the witness, but with all the terrible persecution the Lord’s people boldly and zealously, with joy and gladness, are singing forth his. praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When we examine the figures now, we find that there is a great increase in the placement of books, booklets, the giving of testimony, the number of hours spent In the field. We find</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">more workers, and more people have obtained literature than the year before. How will this compare at the end of the year? Every director should take up this matter with the company in the service meetings. All field workers should carefully consider what they will do in the next few months. Remember, last year the Society arranged for a wide distribution of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font1"> disposed of hundreds of thousands of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and Purgatory, Crimes and Calamities,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">War or Peace</span><span class="font1"> booklets. During the month of September alone, 2,064,441 of these pieces of literature were distributed. September, 1933, was one of the greatest months ever enjoyed by the Lord’s people in giving such a concentrated witness. To surpass this great total in September, much work will be necessary on the part of the brethren in the distribution of the booklets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Last year we were disposing of all. of the large-size booklets on hand. Why not have such a witness this year also, only, instead of using these older booklets, use the new ones that the Lord has provided, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uis Works, Beyond the Grave, Intolerance,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">World Recovery,</span><span class="font1"> and any other two of 1he 20-odd booklets now ready for distribution? Six booklets make up a very attractive combination for the people. They can be offered upon a contribution of only a Quarter. Every farmhouse and every home in small towns should be offered a combination of these booklets on various subjects, so that they may have an opportunity this winter to study and learn more of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If during these two months of August and September each companyworker and sharpshooter would put forth an extraordinary effort to place at least two six-booklet Combinations each week-end it wouldn’t be very long until -this would run into the millions. The year’s report for 1933 shows that all the workers in the United States placed 9,872,335 books and booklets. That means that during July, August and September, three months, In order to come up to that total, there must be placed approximately 2,650,000 books and booklets, or 900,000 for each of these three months. During the past nine mouths we have .averaged around 800,000 books and booklets a month, and by so doing have shown an increase over the same period of last year; but now having in mind that during the month of September alone there were more than 2,000,000 books and booklets placed, It will mean a real, concentrated effort on the part of the anointed. Why not put in a little more time, give a few more testimonies during August and September, so we can surpass the marvelous report of last year?</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">It is very manifest in the witness work today that the people are taking a decided stand on one side or the other. Either they accept the truth gladly and are pleased that Jehovah’s witnesses call on them with this most needed, information, or they reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The lecture given by Brother Rutherford over two chain hook-ups, “Fuse Now,” has caused such worldwide interest that the lecture has been electrically transcribed on records, so as to be used throughout the earth, and on July 22 more than 225 radio stations will broadcast this important truth, and thereafter it. will be used on more than 1,000 transcription machines in all the eartli. Now the lecture is being prepared in booklet form along with that never-to-be-forgotten “Would Contbol” lecture from Los Angeles, California, that was broadcast to the uttermost parts of the earth. These two lectures are now being prepared in booklet form under the title </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The witness being given with the transcription machines is extraordinary. We are now nearing the 150,000 mark in attendance at these meetings in the United States alone. Reports from other countries show a wonderful witness given, and the Lord’s favor upon this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is being sent tO' every individual having a transcription machine a new outline for the transcription meetings, which sets out a series of twelve lectures followed by question and answer meetings. This scries will begin with the now well known lecture “Elbis Now”. This lecture, which Is one hour in length, will be available for all the brethren to use in the witness work after July 22. The series starts with “Ft.ee Now”, and a week later, &quot;Would Coni'BOL,” a half-hour talk by Brother Rutherford, followed by a half hour of questions and answers on this subject. These new records are being sent to all companies and individuals operating a transcription machine, and can be used as soon as they are received after July 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The outline should be followed as closely as possible, and all meetings well advertised so that all the people in a given area will have opportunity to come and hear the lectures. The phonograph lectures also have a part to play in these meetings, which will be most interesting to the public, as is outlined in the letter of special instruction. Strenuous efforts should he put forth through the summer months and the fall to ' bring these important messages to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Special transcription meeting folders are being prepared, samples of which will soon be sent to all those having , the transcription machines, and these should he ordered in the regular way.

<p><span class="font1">This promises to be the banner witness of the year, if not the greatest witness to date. The need of the message cannot be overemphasized, and undoubtedly the due time has now arrived when this message must be delivered to the people. The brethren everywhere should start making arrangements now for making this the most effective campaign to date. The booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler,</span><span class="font1"> containing “Flee Now” and ‘‘World Control”, speeches by Brother Rutherford which have been broadcast over one nation-wide and two selected chains of radio stations, is the booklet to be used. Those who have heard the message realize tbat this booklet contains a measuring rod provided by the Lord whereby the Jonadabs and prisoners may ascertain their relationship and responsibility to Jehovah and his organization now, and also his provision for their salvation and preservation. All who are of Judea have a very definite responsibility now and must busy themselves in delivering this message. All of the anointed, of course, will recognize this not only as a responsibility, but as a great privilege conferred upon them by Jehovah, and will rejoice to accept It and go forward with enthusiasm, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Make Report of Attendance</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every effort is being put forth at this time by the enemy of God and his anointed to prevent the Kingdom message from going forward. With all of this opposition Jehovah enlightens his people with new methods to serve him and offset every effort on the part of the enemy to stop the witness. Now there has been provided for the anointed a set of lectures recorded by Brother Rutherford on 12-inch discs, to be run on a phonograph at 78 revolutions per minute. These lectures are short and to the point, and will aid the people greatly in understanding the purposes of Jehovah and how Jehovah will vindicate his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society Is supplying these records to the brethren at 70c each, or six dises for $3.50, or all 9 discs for $5.25. Each disc has two lectures, one on each side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This being a new means of proclaiming the truth, a record should be kept of how<sup>7</sup> many people hear these lectures. The work done with these records on phonographs should be Included in the regular transcription machine report. The Society desires the following information concerning use of phonograph records:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(1) The number of different machines used during the month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">(2) The number of lectures given. (Each side of a disc is a lecture.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">(3) The number of meetings held to which the public have been invited. . their secular employment is limited by the shortening of the hours by the government. This should enable many to devote Saturday and Sunday at the beginning and end of this campaign to full time in the service. If the service director, In choosing the territory to be worked, gives consideration to these features and plans it so that medium-sized towns and cities in the territory are worked during this campaign, the brethren can go out and spend Saturday and Sunday entirely in the service. Automobile camps and cabins will he available at that time probably much cheaper tbau ordinarily, due to the fact that the summer rush will be over, and a group of workers can concentrate on a town or city and complete it in short order.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The details of this campaign will be contained in the following </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font1"> but in order that the preliminary arrangements might bo undertaken now it is called to your attention at this time. Those who can do so should make arrangements to get some time off from secular employment during this period. The campaign, as you know, is not limited to the United States alone, but is an international campaign. All the countries throughout the world where the Kingdom message is preached will have a part in it. Last time, you remember, there were 83 countries heard from, nearly four million .testimonies given, and 1,561,242 pieces of literature placed. Are we going to do better? Will there be more than 41,037 workers? and will we put in more than 462,302 hours in the witness work ? By the Lord’s grace, we will; ■won’t we?</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Since the brethren have had these records a number of letters have come in to this office about how they are being used in cities every night in the week. If you have a portable phonograph, carry it along with the records, and in rural territory it might be advisable iu some cases to leave one of the workers at a farmhouse aud run a record or two where there are several present. The other workers can go on with their witness work and call back in an hour. Such an arrangement would be considered as a transcription meeting, and reported as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A report of your experiences in the use of these records will be appreciated, and be sure to make regular monthly report of machine activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 3) </span><span class="font1">is being prepared for a special occasion, namely, The Kingdom Braise Period, beginning September 29. This booklet will be used throughout the entire world, and it is hoped that millions of people will be blessed with Brother Rutherford’s stirring lectures, “Flee Now” and “World Control”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every pioneer, auxiliary, sharpshooter, company worker and Jona-dab will want a good supply of these booklets on hand by the time The Kingdom Praise Period rolls around. Be ready to go forward in another intensive campaign against the Devil’s organization under the direction of our Righteous Ruler. Now is the time to make haste and do everything within our power to preach this gospel of the Kingdom, and again a splendid opportunity is afforded Jehovah’s witnesses th rough this new booklet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">| Cover Rural Territory </span><span class="font2">Offer One Bound Book and Six Booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the months of July, August and September the rural territory should be completely and thoroughly worked; the combination to be used, one bound book and six booklets, as suggested in the last </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is true that the people in the rural districts are undergoing considerable hardship due to the drought and the depression in general. They are losing their stock, and their homes; and the prospects for the future are very bad. The Kingdom has the only permanent and real solution for their trouble. Many think that by sympathizing with people in these conditions they are being a comfort to them, where in reality they are contributing nothing .to their welfare; but if we leave the Kingdom message in their hands in printed form it will be a real aid to them ; it will give them something worth while to look forward to. Therefore the entire rural territory should be thoroughly covered before Sept. 29, the next Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where the people do not feci that they can contribute 50c (so as to have the Preparation book and six booklets), Jehovah’s witnesses should stress particularly their need of having six of the new booklets, because six booklets will cover such a variety of subjects. Every worker should always carry with him several combinations of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">His</span><span class="font1"> Wor/cs, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Beyond the Grave, World- Recovery, Intolerance, Dividing the People, Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> or other booklets, and before leaving any homes these booklets should be offered to them, setting out the importance of having these booklets in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The workers will recall that last year, during the summer particularly, the Catholics were putting on a tremendous campaign to “get Judge Rutherford off the air”. The Lord’s anointed rallied to this occasion with tremendous zeal and determination. During the month of September more than two million pieces of literature were placed in the hands of the people, aud these mostly with Catholics. Brother Rutherford’s Plainfield address, which now appears in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span><span class="font1"> booklet, and which was published In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font1"> us well as his letter to the Catholic press, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and Purgatory</span><span class="font1"> booklet, a fine thing fertile Catholics, War </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">or Peace,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crimes and Calamities</span><span class="font1"> were offered in combination. In order to equal the witness, as far as placements are concerned, it will be necessary for the workers to place several million of these new booklets In the hands of the people during August and September. It can be done if every worker will put forth the effort. Where </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font1"> and the six booklets canuot be placed, offer the booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fight is on. The Devil is doing his utmost through his organization to hinder the work. I-Ie has brought about more opposition this year than he did last year, which was so manifest through the Catholic organization. There is every reason for the Lord’s people to fight harder and to press the battle to the gate more than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let’s make the last two months, August and September, the best two months of this fiscal year, the same as last year’s September was the best month of last year’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As Brother Rutherford called to our attention in the chain broadcast “Flee Now”, there is a very definite responsibility resting upon those of Judea to aid, comfort and instruct all who are in Judea and show them the Lord’s provision for their blessing.</span></p>

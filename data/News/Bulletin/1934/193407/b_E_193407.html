<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">One Book and Six Booklets for Witness Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The marked increase in the placements bound books during the month “ of May indicates that the time is ripe for a more concerted and uniform presentation of the bound books. During the past year ■ or more the brethren have gradually drifted into the habit of presenting booklets. The depression and other conditions made it difficult, and in many cases impossible, for the people to take bound books or large combinations of booklets. Therefore a very wide distribution of single booklets took place during that time. This is now bearing fruit. Many of those who obtained and read the booklets want bound books and more booklets. Therefore every presentation during .the next three months at least should contain both books and booklets. More than 100,-000 people attend the transcription machine meetings every month. These want bound books and more booklets; offer these to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many companies have an unbalanced stock of literature on their shelves, due to workers’ pushing one or two books to the exclusion of others. Where such condition exists the director and stockkeeper should confer immediately and make a close check of their stock and then arrange to include in the special com-</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>&quot;IN HIS NAME</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SHALL THE NATIONS HOPE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Message going forth to ‘flee now’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The message contained in the lecture “WOULD CONTROL”, given by Brother Rutherford over a nation-wide chain of radio stations, has caused wide interest, and many are taking their stand on the side of the Lord. The lecture “FLEE NOW” contains such an important message to the people of the earth that It is again being broadcast over a chain. From the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Canada, on July 8, Sunday afternoon, Brother Rutherford will, by the Lord’s grace, again set forth the importance of fleeing now. A large assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses Is expected at the convention to be held at Toronto, and a public meeting, at which it is anticipated there will be at least 12,000 i people, has been arranged for. Connected with this place will be a chain of radio stations in the eastern part of the United States, and radio announcements are being printed to advertise this chain broadcast. These will he consigned to the companies for distribution five or six days before the time of broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So important is this lecture that another opportunity to hear it is being arranged for July 22 in all parts of the United States. The lecture will be electrically tranbinations during these three months those books with which they are overstocked. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most of the activity during this period will be in rural territory. To reach many of these people represents considerable expense on the part of the brethren; therefore, more than one booklet should be offered to the people. A combination of books and booklets is the desirable thing. The foregoing are only a few of the many reasons why a book and booklet combination should be offered during the summer. To aid all the brethren throughout the country in making a uniform presentation, the Society is arranging to print a special testimony card for one book and six booklets for those who contribute 50c. With this additional testimony card the .workers are equipped with a testimony card for al! the bound books, a testimony card for one book and six booklets, a testimony card for single bound books, and also a testimony card for different booklets, so that with this variety of ways of presenting the literature adequate provisions are made for all kinds of .territory. We recommend the “single book and six booklets” combination for the next three months particularly, believing this to be well within the reach of the majority of people and enabling them, to make a choice of any book and booklets they may feel they need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">scribed on records and sent to approximately 150 broadcasting stations, and on July 22 millions more will have the opportunity of hearing this lecture. Radio announcements for this broadcast will also be consigned to all the companies in time to thoroughly advertise “Flee Now”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Shortly thereafter, throughout the entire world, nearly a thousand transcription machines will have this same lecture to carry into every nook and corner setting forth the clear-cut course that the peoples of the earth shall take. It is time for the people to ‘flee to the mountains’, and all of Jehovah’s witnesses will want to participate In proclaiming this message. In the United States alone more than 100,000 people are listening to these lectures by electrical transcription monthly. Many thousands more are listening In other countries. The time has come to proclaim this message far and wide, even though the Catholics, Protestants and the entire Devil’s organization try to stop this message.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Big Increase in Bound Book Placements</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,400 More Workers 40,000 More Hours</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An interesting analysis of the activity during the month of May this year with that of last has been compiled, and, viewed from every angle, it is most encouraging and gratifying. There has been a very decided increase In the number of bound books placed, the increase amounting to 23,575, divided about equally among .the companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries. This is encouraging from two angles : first, because it Indicates that there is a marked increase in the interest of the people in the message of the Kingdom, and a desire for it in a more permanent form; second, it reflects the results of the more effective testimony given with the card. Undoubtedly many of the brethren talk too much and with poor effect. With the testimony card, presenting the facts and laying them before the mind of the prospect in a clear, concise and orderly way, it enables them to weigh the matter as it affects them and to decide without any outside Influence. From time to time we do receive scattered letters from different brethren here and there claiming that they can accomplish more by verbal testimony. This may be true in some isolated cases, but as far as the work in general throughout the country is concerned, it clearly indicates the Lord's approval and blessing upon the testimony card, and we strongly recommend its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was a drop of 19,000 in the number of booklets. However, the increase in the number of bound books more than makes up for it, so that for the month’s work we show a total increase of 4,088 pieces of literature. The placements per hour show a two-tenths drop both' in the pioneer and in the company activity, indicating that It is a little harder to place the literature this year than it was last, although those Interested in the Kingdom message are desirous of having it in a more permanent form. However, this difficulty was overcome by the fact that we had an increase of 2,436 workers in the field during the month over the same period last year. This made an increase of 41,578 hours and of 203,572 testimonies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">125,000 Attended Transcription Meetings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">More Machines in the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Splendid Audience for 8 Months</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s rich blessing has been upon the work carried on with the Portable Transcription Machines, as is shown by the summary of eight months’ activity of this fiscal year in the United States and other countries under the jurisdiction of the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of machines reporting each month has gradually increased from 282 in October, 1933, to 498 in May, 1934. The work of manufacturing the Transcription Machines by the Society is steadily moving forward, and by the end of this fiscal year we hope to have more than 600 machines reporting each month. Again the attendance for one month passed the 100,090 mark. In May 125,768 persons attended the meetings.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">We believe that this marked interest on the part of the people is an indication of the Lord’s will that an effort should be made to continue to supply them with more of the bound books, and the recommendation for the summer months of July and August particularly is to push a combination of one bound book and six booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite all the opposition on the part of the adversary, and the depression which still exists and which in many parts of the country amounts to absolute discouragement, the message of the Kingdom is going forward with increasing bounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following table will prove a very interesting study for every one of the Lord’s people,</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Placements &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;453,390 &nbsp;&nbsp;454,804</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past eight months there has been a total of 22,614 meetings held, with an attendance of 732,553 persons. The average attendance per meeting is 32. At these meetings there have been placed 6,061 bound books and 41,599 booklets, or a total of 47,660 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now that summer is here, and with it the best time of the year for witnessing to the people, we hope to see a much greater increase in the Transcription work during the four remaining months of the fiscal year. The Increased number of daylight hours, with the fact that the people congregate In parks and at beaches In the evenings and on holidays, greatly increases the opportunities to use the Transcription Machine to witness to the people. The opportunities thus presented are precious to Jehovah’s witnesses, and we must nil be diligent to make the best use of them.</span></p>

No territory assignments, orders or other correspondence can be attended to during the vacation period; and if everything is arranged before vacation begins, the rush of work following will be greatly relieved, the field workers will not be delayed, and the only mail they will need send to the office during vacation will be the report - for the month of July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Have sufficient literature on hand, ordering what you need, and accompany your order with a remittance to cover if your account is not in good condition, so the literature can be sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Have assigned prior to vacation sufficient territory to last until late fall, if possible. Much isolated territory remains to be witnessed in this year.

These special rates are not granted, for subscriptions received from other bretliren, because sharpshooters and members of companies are to send in their subscriptions and renewals through the company, sending the Society the full price therefor. The special rates are granted to pioneers and auxiliaries for the primary purpose of aiding them in the actual witness work, from house to house, and obtaining new subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no arrangement for charging subscriptions to the accounts of pioneers or auxiliaries. On the contrary, whenever a pioneer or auxiliary sends In a subscription, the remittance should be sent in along with it at the special rate, so an entry on the account will not be necessary.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Using the 12-Inch Records?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many interesting reports are being received from the brethren who have phonograph machines and are now using the 41-mmute lectures of Brother Rutherford to bring the message of the Kingdom to tbeir friends and neighbors. These lectures are short, to the point, and create interest, and books are placed in many instances after the people hear one or two of these short discourses. The Society is supplying the six discs, double faced, making 12 lectures on 12-inch records, for $3.50. If you have a phonograph you should have a set of these records to aid you in the preaching of the message of the Kingdom. Many small meetings have been started in different parts of the country with the aid of these lectures. The Jona-dabs are associating themselves, and are now studying God’s Word of Truth by this means along with tbe books, and in many places they are taking an active part in the witness work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We are pleased to' notify the brethren throughout the United States that on July 8 Brother Rutherford’s lecture “FLEE NOW” will be broadcast over a network of eastern stations covering the most populous areas of the United States. ' At the same time It will be broadcast from the short-wave station in Schenectady, New York, W2XAF, 9530 kilocycles. On a previous occasion this station was heard in South Africa, Australia, Europe, as yrell as in all parts of the United Sates, and Canada, and it is hoped .Hint the brethren can arrange to tune in at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, Eastern Standard Time. Each one can figure out the time accordingly, and arrangements can be made for groups of the brethren to listen in on short-wave receiving sets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It Is expected that a large number of Jehovah’s witnesses will be at the convention assembled at Toronto, Canada, advertising the King and the Kingdom throughout that area. On Sunday afternoon a large public meeting in the Maple Leaf Gardens will be addressed hy Brother Rutherford. This hall scats 12,000 people.

'There are now 52 pioneers, 16 auxiliaries and 71 company workers in that country, ami dwruig the month of May they distributed 11,434 books and booklets. The branch manager reports that the workers are very enthusiastic and putting forth .greater efforts than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">UNITED STATES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the items of interest received from pioneers using transcription machines are the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We have the L. I). S. church for the series. One night the preacher rang the M. E, church bell for two or three minutes to drown the lecture as the people were standing on tbe corners listening to the lectures ‘The True God’ and ‘The Mimic God'. People stood outside the M. E. church listening to the lectures.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The transcription machine is doIng a great dividing work. Some, after being behind a plow all day, are walking as far as lour miles to hear the lectures in the evening. We try to locate a camp where people can come and hear in the evening, and on Saturdays put on the lectures on the street where people gather in small towns, and on Sundays where we have found local interest. Often the lectures arouse much interest and result in placing more books and booklets than were placed in the first house-to-house witnessing in the community.” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">PIOKEEBS AND AUXILIABIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You will be very glad to know that more than 2,000 pioneers uud over 1,000 auxiliaries are now enrolled. The increase in enrollment, though slow, has been gradual during the year, and the ranks of this little band should grow in numbers, and certainly not stop because this figure has been reached. Why should not this year see the pioneer and auxiliary army the largest of all time?</span></p>

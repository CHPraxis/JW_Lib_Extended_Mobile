<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE RADIO ANNOUNCEMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As has been previously announced, on March 25 there will be a coast-to-coast hook-up comprising more than 115 radio stations. These will .curry Brother Rutherford’s lecture on ‘‘WORLD CONTROL”. Announcement folders for this chain are being consigned for all the workers. Pioneers and auxiliaries addressed in company or sharpshooter territory will receive an allotment from the director or sharpshooter; which likewise applies to foreign-speaking aud colored companies. Those isolated will receive theirs direct from the Society. The directors and sharpshooters should be sure to notify all the workers, whether they be auxiliaries, pioneers or company workers, that the folders are on hand and should be used in their regular witness work from door to door from the time they are received up until the broadcast. Al! of the folders should be distributed no later than Sunday morning, Marell 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“DIVIDING THE PEOPLE” TESTIMONY CARDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The foreign-speakiug brethren will be provided with a testimony&quot; card with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font5"> testimony in their respective languages. These will be sent to the directors as soon as they are ready.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of the extreme amount of other printing before us, It is impossible to provide the testimony card for the English-speaking brethren. They may use the testimony as printed in the March </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font5"> or have a supply of their own printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CELLULOID ENVELOPES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society can now supply the brethren with a celluloid envelope for holding a testimony card. These envelopes keep the testimony card nice and clean, so that it Is always in a neat ami presentable condition. They will take a card 3| by 51 inches. These envelopes may be had at 10c each or three for a quarter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TESTIMONY BOOKLETS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Testimony” booklet, containing a testimony (in sixteen languages) for the books and booklets, is now ready and is being sent with this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font5"> for distribution of one booklet to each worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our brethren in Canada and Mexico will be working shoulder to shoulder with those of Jehovah’s witnesses in the rest of the world. North America will bo well informed of the Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service, Chain Hook-Up and Record “Requirements” Make Los Angeles Convention a World-wide Gathering</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Friday night, March 23, is the opening of the Los Angeles convention. Ail of the Lord’s anointed who can possibly get there will be there for the opening meeting of the convention so that they will be ready for the service on Saturday morning, which is tire beginning of the International Thanksgiving Testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses. Thousands of the brethren are expected, and abundant blessings arc? in store for those who attend this convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">AU the meetings will be held in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Shrine </span><span class="font5">Auditorium Building. Every morning from S: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">00 </span><span class="font5">until 12:00 has been set aside for field service work. There -will be meetings in the afternoon and evening which will aid the brethren in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">understanding of the Lord’s Word. Sunday afternoon, at 3: 30 Pacific Standard Time, Brother Rutherford, by the Lord’s grace, will lecture on the subject “WORLD </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONTROL”, </span><span class="font5">and at this time arrangements include more than 115 radio stations in a eoast-to-coast network that will serve the millions of people eager to hear Judge Rutherford who live in the United States and Canada. All of the remnant will make arrangements to listen in. This is one of the blessings with which everyone will be favored who can hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For those who will not be privileged to attend this convention, the Lord in his goodness has provided a special blessing for this Thanksgiving Period. It is now arranged by means of an electrical transcription record that Brother Rutherford will be able to talk to all of the anointed in many countries throughout the earth. In every English-speaking country whore there are transcription machines the lecture “Requibjs-ments” has been shipped. The Lord’s people will assemble together either on Saturday, March 2-1, or on Sunday, March 25, and the anointed and people of good will will be overjoyed to hear this message which the Lord has surely provided for his people at this time. Never before lias such an arrangement been made whereby a greater part of those who are in a covenant relationship with the Lord could hear a message provided by Jehovah at the same lime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With this at tiie beginning of the week, everyone will undoubtedly put forth an extraordinary effort to serve the only true Goel by giving testimony from door to door, which will be to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Many countries, especially all of the English-speaking countries, have been provided with the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People. </span><span class="font5">Why not make arrangements during this period to spend, at least four hours every day in the field service, the same as it has been arranged at the convention in Los Angeles. There are many of the brethren who will be able to do this. Those who cannot do this cau surely put in Saturday afternoons and the best part of both Sundays in the field service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is really a time of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">thanksgiving,</span><span class="font5"> for it will be during this week that everyone who is in Jine for the Kingdom will be partaking of the Memorial supper. Just let us recall the many features of the convention that many will enjoy even though they cannot attend:</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>GOODNEWS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NORTHERN EUROPE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in the countries of northern Europe broke all records for a nine-day period during the midwinter campaign, January 20-28. During that period 2,071 brethren were out in the service, and they placed 1,547 books and 132,449 booklets. That was more than 250 additional workers, and about </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,000 </span><span class="font5">pieces of literature more than ever before for those countries. Now these brethren are preparing for the greatest campaign yet, the Thanksgiving Testimony op Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MOST DISTANT POINTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">200,000 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font5"> booklets Jiave been shipped to Australia, and 40,000 to New Zealand, and the brethren there will have them for the International campaign. 35,000 have gone to South Africa, 10,000 to West Africa, and 10,000 to India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tiie Slovak edition of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font5"> is being rushed through so that Jehovah’s witnesses in Czechoslovakia will have them by March </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SPANISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Comagnments of Spanish </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font5"> are going forward to Mexico, Cuba, Chile, Argentina, and other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">COUNTRIES OF THE EAST</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font5"> will be published in Arabic, Albanian and Greek. Shipments of these booklets will soon he on their way to Syria, Albania, and Egypt, and it is hoped they will arrive there in time for the Thanksgiving period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CENTRAL EUROPE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Berne factory is working hard to get out </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People </span><span class="font5">in German, French, Dutch, and other languages, and it is expected that the anointed in France, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Poland, Rumania, Austria, and Yugoslavia will have </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A half million </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font5"> booklets were shipped to England in January for the midwinter campaign. This was considered a large quantity, but till of them were shipped out to the brethren, and now the London office has cabled for an additional supply. The factory at Brooklyn lias just completed a week of working extra time in the evenings from 7:00 till 9:30 in order io supply the heavy demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Are We Going to Reach the Mark?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AwrfHartes </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">by March 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the first of the year many questionnaires have been mailed to brethren responding to the call to enter either the pioneer or the auxiliary work. Doubtless you have considered what arrangements you must make to get in auxiliary time of 52 hours every month in house-to-house work, or to enter the service full time as pioneer. Have you made application yet?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is still hoped that the auxiliary list will increase to at least 1,000 hy Memorial time. This figure has not yet been reached: just now there are 872 enrolled. We earnestly hope the applications will arrive speedily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneer time is full time in the field, and 110 hours each month is the established minimum. All the brethren will be interested in this quotation from a letter sent to the pioneers some time ago: “Let us stop to consider for just a minute how much T10 hours a month’ is. Say you work 6 days a week, 5 hours a day, only 2J in the morning and 2J in the afternoon. That would make 30 hours every week. There are 4 weeks in every month, and that makes 120 hours in the door-to-door witnessing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many who are really feeble, or otherwise physically handicapped, have been enabled to serve as auxiliaries or pioneers by using the printed testimony, as they have written to us. We shall be very happy to send you information regarding this service upon hearing from you. The territory mentioned In the February </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font5"> is not all assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Leaders for March 31 and April 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As usual, the factory, office and home will be closed during the first and the last Saturday of this period to enable the Bethel brethren to join with you to a greater extent in the field activity, and it is anticipated that, by the Lord’s grace, this period is going to exceed any up to the present in the field activity of the Bethel family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of the fact that Brother Rutherford has arranged to provide a special record for the opening of the Thanksgiving Testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses, and that his nation-wide radio talk comes on Sunday, the usual custom of sending service leaders from Bethel during the first part of this period will be dispensed with. However, any company within the 200-miIe radius of Bethel desiring a service leader for the latter part of this testimony period, Saturday March 31 and Sunday April 1, may have one, provided they write in and request one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dividing the People </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Booklet in Many Languages</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So important is the message contained in the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font5"> that it is to be again presented to the people during “Thanksgiving Testimony” Period, March </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">24 </span><span class="font5">to April 1, Since this is to be an international period of united witnessing, the brethren everywhere will he presenting the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font5"> booklet. For the brethren in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">United States in particular, the Society will have ready for the March testimony period the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font5"> booklet in the following languages: Albanian, Arable, English, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Lithuanian, Russian, Slovak, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Span</span><span class="font5">ish, and Ukrainian. Please place your orders at once, so that by Marell 24 yon will have what you need of any of these booklets.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Dipttling the People</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The results of “Dividing the People” Testimony, January 20-28, are especially interesting since the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font5"> booklet is to be used </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">during </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thanksgiving Testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses, March 24 to April 1. The figures certainly enable us to establish a mark at which to alm during the testimony period just ahead. Results for the United States and outlying territory under this office:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bound </span><span class="font5">books placed, 19,736; booklets, 533,903; total literature, 553,639; by 16,974 workers, including pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters and company workers. Total hours, 197,065 ; testimonies, 1,368,610; persons taking literature, 485,144. This is a splendid report. Never before has there been a midwinter testi</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A Good Suggestion for Transcription Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tile portable transcription machine activity throughout the earth is going ahead with leaps and bounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A method that has been found very practical in the large cities and should also work ont advantageously in the smaller places, is the following :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren come in contact with a home where considerable Interest is manifest by the people. Inquiry is made of that party if they would like to have a transcription meeting in their home to which they could invite their neighbors, friends and relatives and if they would be willing to have any other outsiders who would be interested in such a meeting also attend. If they give assent they are provided with as many invitations as they think they can use among their relatives, friends and neighbors dnd are requested to personally invite these people to this meeting. It has been found that a good many people will attend the meeting upon an invitation of this kind, as the average person Is reluctant to go to another person’s home on invitation by a stranger or on such invitation by leaflet; but if the party owning the home invites them they know who has invited them and they gladly come and attend the meeting. Probably ten or fifteen friends, neighbors and relatives of the party owning the home come together with others, for the first meeting. At this meeting all who attend are asked to invite their neighbors and friends to mony period in which such a great witness was given, or which oven approaches these results. This is a cause for thanksgiving by all who were privileged to share in the work with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As shown above, well over half a million booklets were placed in nine days’ time, in bitter winter weather. The United States quota for the next testimony period is one million copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People.</span><span class="font5"> To reach this, we shall need to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">double the work of the last period.</span><span class="font5"> Twice as much work in the same number of days! Can it be done? We believe it can, with the I.os Angeles convention, more workers In the field, each one spending many more hours in the service, pushing the work in thickly-settled territory, consistent efficient use of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">printed </span><span class="font5">testimony, and, above all, the rich blessing of Jehovah on I-Iis devoted people. Will it be done? Twice as many hours in the field, at least twice as many testimonies given, double the number of booklets placed! A tremendous witness to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the next one. It is called to their attention that this message of the Kingdom is for all to hear. Those present are given as many invitations as they think they can effectively use among their neighbors, friends and relatives, and they are pleased to take them. As a result the second meeting of the series brings in many more. A similar practice is followed at the third, the fourth, the fifth, ami the sixth meeting. This has a very wholesome effect on all concerned; it makes them feel that they have a part in the work; it prepares them for the study, which is another forward step in this Kingdom progress, and they enter into the study with greater enthusiasm than they otherwise would. As the weeks go by it becomes the talk of the vicinity in which the series is held, and soon many new faces are seen at these meetings, By the time the territory is covered with four invitations and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font5"> a good study can be established at the close of the seventh meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Work During Coming Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pioneers have an important part to take during Thanksgiving Testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses If the quota of a million booklets is to be reached. In general, they should work in towns during the entire period, so they can make as many calls aud placements as possible. This means that pioneers with companies should obtain from the service director local assignments of</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thanksgiving Testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every service director, sharpshooter, auxiliary and pioneer is to make a special report for Thanksgiving Testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses, on one of the regular report curds. From the card cross out the words </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“For </span><span class="font5">the entire month of” and write “Thanksgiving Testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses, March 24 to April 1”. Enter on the card all work for the nine days, showing the total of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> booklets, including </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People,</span><span class="font5"> in the space headed “Mise. Booklets”. Please report promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you report for the entire month of March include the work done during the testimony period, including April 1. Two report cards are to be sent to us for work in March : one for the testimony period only, and the other for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">entire </span><span class="font5">month </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(including</span><span class="font5"> the testimony period). We have never yet received testimony period reports from every one as we should. Let each company worker cooperate with the service director in reporting promptly, and let each service director, sharpshooter, auxiliary and pioneer see to It that he is not one of the delinquent brethren who do not report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Divisional Campaign Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneers, auxiliaries, company workers and sharpshooters will participate in the divisional campaign of Saturday and Sunday March 3 and 4, and, as usual, all these brethren will make a special report to the divisional leader of their work during the two days of the campaign. The divisional leaders are the only ones who are to make special separate reports to this office, showing the work done during (hose two days only. This work done during the two days of the campaign is to be included in the regular monthly reports of all sharpshooters, companies, auxiliaries and pioneers. Except for the divisional leaders’ reports, no one should report separately to this office the work of these two days. Following the last divisional campaign, many pioneers, auxiliaries and sharpshooters sent us cards for their work during the campaign only. This should not. be done. The work of the divisional campaigns is to be included in the regular monthly reports these workers send to this office, and not reported separately. At the end of March, every pioneer, auxiliary, sharpshooter and company service director should send to this office a report of the work done during the entire month (including the two days of the divisional campaign).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">city territory, or in outlying towns, rather than in the rural districts.

The towns should be recovered with all literature later, after this testimony period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the isolated pioneers may be working in rurals during the period, not having town territory available. These brethren need not confine their work to the booklet only, but should present books as well when they make their calls in the rurals, leaving </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People </span><span class="font5">in every case where literature is taken, including it in all combinations. The importance of this booklet cannot be overemphasized, and the booklet should ho stressed en-tliuslasticiilly by till.</span></p>

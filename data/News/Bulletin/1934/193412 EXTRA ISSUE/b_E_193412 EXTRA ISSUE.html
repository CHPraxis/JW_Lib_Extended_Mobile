<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">That Ought to Keep Us Busy and Make the Adversary</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Hop Sidewise</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">.. Each Worker Should Obtain 14 Signatures Daily</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">/ The brethren assembled in a gio-rious convention at Atlanta, Ga., and there were more than four thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">t,At the Saturday afternoon ses-feision a “Warning Declaration” was ^'unanimously passed by all the con-®entioners. There was one dissenting ^wte7&quot;a&quot;Cathc»Iic’'i)riest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I' A new booklet is being prepared containing the &quot;warning declara-^tion”, and after reading this every one of the' Lord’s anointed and the Jonadab brethren will want to go right down the line with the petition, the three million booklets and several hundred thousand clothbound books. It will be a glorious fight, and even though winter is coming on, the weather is cold and inclement, each and every one will want to perform his part of the work to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are three very important duties to carry forward during December and January: the petition, the new booklet, and the bound-book . campaign. Each one has its part in the arrangement for the field service, and the outline set out herein should be followed closely by each company, sharpshooter arrangement, auxiliary and pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Quota of signers to be obtained has been set at ten million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">. It is easy to imagine someone, whose faith is weak, saying it can’t be done, but the Lord through his Word makes void any such attitude, ‘Wb. </span><span class="font1">CAN DO ALL THINGS IN Hill THAT STBENGTHENETH US.’--</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Here are the facts. There are approximately 24,000 witnesses in the United States. If each one obtains 417 signers we shall exceed ten million. But someone will say, “Oh, yes, how are we going to get 417 gaeh,’ That is some job.” That is ■nut so vdifflcult when it is viewed from its proper angle. All of the brethren w'iU have at least 30 days -in which to do this work ; some will have more, Jiut, allowing just 30 <sup>;</sup> days each, yoW quota can be oh-taini.Nl by getting 14 signers every</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I'dav. So you Ff is not impossible, iby'any mean <sup>?e</sup> *<sup>f</sup>t is true each one *&gt;111 have &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own hours,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">evenings and every available moment, but this is a time of war and a time when everything else must be subservient to the great issue. Always have a Petition sheet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">with </span><span class="font3">you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, these are not all the possibilities that are available for obtaining signatures. The Kingdom work has expanded considerably since last year’s petition campaign. The following agencies are brought into action this'year: Every radio station carrying transcription records is being supplied with special an<sup>1 </sup>nouncements calling attention to the petitiou and inviting all who wish to do so to send to the station for one or more of these and circulate .them among their friends. The radio representative who is contacting that station will be charged with the responsibility of seeing that he gets these letters from the station and supplies the people with the necessary forms as they require them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Next, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> (No. 397) which carries Brother Rutherford’s radio speech “Tbuth : Shaul It Be Suppressed?” will also carry one page as a petition form with a special invitation to all </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Godden Age </span><span class="font3">subscribers to cut out this page and circulate It among their friends and also write us for as many more forms as they may require. Every sound car meeting is to contain a number of announcements regarding this petition, and the service director or the one who has charge of the meeting is to see to it that adequate provisions are made for those present to sign the petition and obtain additional copies to circulate among their friends as well as giving them an opportunity to get the literature. Sound cars and transcription machines broadcasting on streets and public places while the brethren are witnessing throughout the neighborhood will also make periodic announcements of the petition, that the people may know what it is all about by the time the workers call upon them. Likewise all transcription and phonograph meetings are to include an introduction of the petition with an Invitation to all present to have a part in circulating them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By this means it will be readily seen that the Lord Is making adequate provision for all persons of good will in this country to take their stand and to declare them</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">selves on the Lord’s side. Do not, however, depend upon the other agencies to do </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font3"> part. Set as your quota 14 signers each day; make it your business to get them. If the petition exceeds ten million, well and good; let each one do his part, and the Lord will undoubtedly add His blessing and make this campaign a stupendous witness to the praise of His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the petition sheets is space for the names and addresses of 20 individuals. Be sure to have also the street number, the city, and the state, so that when the time comes the United States Government will have no excuse for not mailing this information to the people of this land. Consignments of the petition blanks have already been made to the companies, pioneers and auxiliaries. Where there are many pioneers, auxiliaries and foreign groups in English company territory the ’'shipment iff being made td the director. The first shipment is made up so that each company worker can have 5 sheets, each auxiliary 10, and pioueers 15,: to start with. As soon as you need more sheets, write in to the Society, and they will be shipped to you immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Obtain the Names</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hand the individual on whom you call the special testimony card. Let him read this. Hand him the books In the wrapper as well as the special booklet. If he is seeking the truth and has 50c he will undoubtedly obtain a combination, which combination will include the special booklet, TRUTH: Shall It Be Suppressed, OR Will Congress Pbotect the</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Be Sure to Make Out Reports Correctly</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses in this country will all wish to have a good stock of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font3"> of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God, Deliverance, Reconciliation</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> on hand so that there will be no interruption whatever in their work w’ith these four books during December and January. Orders should be placed at once, and as your supply runs low during the two months reorder, and do not stop the work with these four books upon using up your original stock, but keep a good supply of all four on hand during the entire two months’ campaign. All orders for these books will be filled at the regular rate, and credit will be given on accounts from the monthly report cards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The report for December is to show only that month’s work, and the report for January only the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">People’s Rights? Whether or not the people decide to take the combination, point out to the person to whom you are witnessing the foreword on the second page, which foreword reads: “One great issue before the American people is whether or not this shall continue to be a land of freedom of speech; or shall the people be like dumb, driven cattle? Read carefully this booklet and then write your congressman what you expect him to do to safeguard your interests.” This statement immediately leads to the petition, which petition should then be presented for the name and address. If the person does not contribute 50c for the three bound books, he will, in most cases, contribute 5e for the booklet, and if not, and he is interested in our work, the booklet should be left free if he promises to read it. The petition he will undoubtedly sign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do not spend any time explaining details or giving long-winded speeches. Make your calls as short as possible. Let the persou read the testimony, and the foreword of the booklet, and sign the petition. Several in one place may wish to sign. As soon as this is done, go to the next-door neighbor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">- We wish to again remind the brethren, particularly those in sections served by the Society’s depots, - to seud their orders to the Brooklyn f office. Everyone should be able to anticipate what supply of literature he will need long enough in ad-‘ vanee to have the order sent to the ; Brooklyn office, thus allowing the Society to route the shipment in the <sup>:</sup> most economical manner and also to relieve the depots of the office work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are emergencies in connec-: tion with special campaigns when it is necessary to send Rush orders to ■ the depots, and provision is made for ‘ filling such orders. However, some .. of the brethren take advantage of - this provision and make it a habit ■ to order small amounts of literature , direct from the depot.

It is full of action, and depicts one of the most iuteresting Bible prophecies setting out the astonishing victory Jehovah will gain for his own people.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses Richly Blessed at Atlanta</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Splendid Witness Given</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses assembled at Atlanta, Georgia, for a three-day convention, and Jehovah richly blessed all who attended and millions who were not able to attend. The big feature of the convention was a radio chain hook-up which covered the southern and eastern parts of the United States. The short-wave stations used carried the message almost everywhere. From Maine to Florida, from the Gulf states to California, into the northern parts of Canada, across the oceans to points remote, Hawaii, Switzerland, South Africa, the message was heard at the same instant that the large audience that packed the auditorium heard tlie lecture. Four sound cars amplifying the message were located at different points in Atlanta. A mighty shout of acclamation went np in all parts of the world when the lovers of righteous</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Must Be There by January 12,1935</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The petitions this year are all going to be assembled at Washington, D.C., and not at Brooklyn. Therefore all packages of signed petitions should be forwarded to Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is printing a special envelope addressed to A. Koerber, 1603 Massachusetts Ave. NW., Washington, D.C., for the purpose of mailing these petitions. As soon as each company, sharpshooter, isolated pioneer or auxiliary has a number of Petition sheets ready these should be mailed, in this envelope, in order that the brethren in Washington booklets on a contribution of 10 cents. Not only many foreign-speaking brethren, but many Englishspeaking ones, have much foreign territory in which it is expedient to use literature in foreign languages instead of in English. All such territory should be covered with these booklets during the two months of December and January in addition to covering the English-speaking territory with the three bound books on a contribution of 50c. All such should order a good supply of these booklets which will be invoiced at the reduced rate, and your order should be placed immediately. Three of these booklets on a contribution of 10 cents is an unusual offer, and a large number of these should be disposed of among foreign-speaking people during these two months while the special offer is good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">a letter from the president of the Society, which letter sets out the special periods as well as brings to your attention the meaning of the Calendar picture. The Calendar pad is unique in that it sets out all special dates in which Jehovah’s witnesses will be particularly interested during the year. Order now from the Society at Brooklyn or through the branch offices. Euclose with the order a remittance of 25c for each Calendar; or five to one address can be had for $1.00. Orders can be grouped and forwarded through the company director or sharpshooter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ness were asked if they wanted a righteous ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This was truly a thrilling convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The report of the work accomplished in Atlanta is very gratifying. The largest number of workers engaging in the field service at oae time was 1,514. There were 23,184 pieces of literature distributed. The brethren during three days worked 11,370 hours and gave 76,448 testimonies. Literature was left in 20,815 homes. What a splendid wltuess!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The pioneers flocked to the convention, 931 of them registering. A regular village was formed by the house-cars and trailers of these pioneers. Everyone was richly blessed. And now, with plenty of work ahead, and refreshed by the truth that has been furnished to Jehovah’s witnesses through his organization, one and all will press on in the witness work, may have an opportunity to keep the work up as it goes along. The envelopes are supplied only to companies, sharpshooters, isolated pioneers and auxiliaries. Pioneers, auxiliaries and foreign groups working in territory of an English company will turn all their petitions over to the English service director, and he will arrange to forward the entire allotment to Washington. It will, of course, be quite in order for those companies that have large lots of petitions to forward to pack them in suitable packages for shipping, but these should be addressed to A. Koerber, 1603 Massachusetts Ave. NW., Washington, D.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A New Book Everyone Should Study Carefully</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the faithful witnesses of Jehovah and the Jonadabs will be thrilled with this new publication, the title of which is “JEHOVAH”. The book will bring to the anointed that Information which is most needed for their comfort and aid in carrying on their Kingdom work. The book is bound in a light, attractive color and beautifully embossed. It has 360 pages of text matter, also forceful illustrations and a very complete index. The edition which you can now have is the autographed edition, which contains a facsimile letter in the author’s own handwriting, which is addressed especially “To His People”. All of the Lord’s anointed and the Jonadab brethren should avail themselves of this publication immediately. It is now ready, and a copy will be mailed to anyone on a contribution of 50c. This contribution will offset the heavy original cost of this publication and w’H_ make it possible to print later editions at less expense. Eacii one should wish to have a part in this privilege. The regular edition will not be ready, however, until about the end of December. Those wishing a copy of the Autographed Edition should order it through the director or the sharpshoooter. If not eonnect-ed with a company, then order direct from the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Lectures Now Available in Spanish</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In many parts of the United States, particularly in the Southwest, there are many Spanish-speaking people. To aid in carrying the message of the Kingdom to these people, the Society has had some of the 43-minute English lectures translated into Spanish aud recorded on regular phonograph records. These are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1-PS Jehova (Jehovah)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2-PS Rebellion (Rebellion)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">5-PS Reino (The Kingdom) 6-PS Armageddon (Armageddon) 7-PS Alma (Soul)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">8-PS LosMuertos (The Dead)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These discs may be had for 70c each, or the three for $2.10. The rate to the pioneers is the same us for the English records. We hope the brethren living in places where there is a large Spanish population v-avail themselves of these r&lt;' -rill and use them in the witn'- ^cords ------------------------- ess work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Big Increase in Workers an Honor to Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report for the first six months of the fiscal year 1933-34 has just been compiled, and we are amazed with the increase over the corresponding period last year. Look at ttie table below and see how the Lord marvelously blessed the efforts of his people during the past six months. Up to and including April 1, 13,3o8,271 testimonies have been gi ven; and this is a tremendous witness, when you think of it. That is an increase of approximately 60 jiercent over last year, and is an average of more than two million testimonies per month. Undoubtedly the card method of presenting the testimony has helped greatly in this iywrease, because it has conserved strength of the brethren; and it lias also made them more efficient, as shown by the fact that the average number of booklets placed per hour this year is 1.85, while last year it was 1.55.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are very happy to note the increase in the average number of workers per month : 18,416, to compare with. 14,650 last year. The number of people who obtained literature, 3,838,220, is nearly double that of last year, and the total of 5,139,010 books and booklets placed is, an increase of over one-third. These figures are even more remarkable when we consider that this work was done during some of the most severe weather this country has had in years, and also during this time special effort was given to the petition work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work done by the sharpshooters is listed in a separate column ; and we are happy to see how these more or less isolated brethren are progressing with their Kingdom 'interests. Note that they have averaged better than 2 booklets per hour, which is the highest record of any of the workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You will also note that 129,089 books and booklets have been placed with the public direct by mail from the Brooklyn office. Every week hundreds of letters are received from interested parties, who have ’'&quot;opened to hear one of Brother therford’s lectures over the radio, <sub>u</sub>r perhaps have read one of the booklets. To such interested parties a catalog is sent, and many orders</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark9"></a>World Recovery?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Another Booklet That Will Enlighten the People and Show Them the Way</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last November Brother Rutherford was privileged to deliver a lecture, World Recovery? which has created intense interest. This lecture is now in booklet form with several other lectures, such as “Commerce”, “Bible Questions Answered,” “The Tabernacle,” and “His Organization”. This booklet is now being printed by the millions. The first edition is 2-J million, and shipments have already been made to all parts of the world, the English-speaking countries in particular, so they will be ready for a world-wide campaign beginning June 30, All of Jehovah’s witnesses should acquaint themselves with this booklet by reading it carefully; for It will do them great good, as “all things written aforetime were written for our learning” ; and then blessed are they that bear this fruit of the Kingdom to all of those who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This booklet will help those of good will In taking their stand definitely on the side of Jehovah and his organization. Its cover is very attractive and speaks volumes. There are several interesting illustrations, which all will enjoy. The booklet will he placed for the first time with the public on June 30, and the usual 5e contribution will be received for the same. The brethren desiring a copy now for their own use can send in 5c, and a booklet will be mailed direct. Directors, pioneers and auxiliaries should please take note that consignments are not being made, but that an order blank is enclosed to be used for the stock for the regular witness period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">for books and booklets are received in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total number of pieces of literature placed is not quite a million a month, but we still hope that by the end of the fiscal year the average will be that amount. Let all those who love Jehovah (pioneers, auxiliaries, company workers, sharpshooters, and Jonadabs) put forth their best endeavors during the coming six months to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another Special Period Not Far Off</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother Rutherford made the following statement in his lecture “World Control” :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Upon earth there is now no peace, and poverty continues to stalk hideously through the land. As Jehovah’s witnesses we have no controversy with men. Our only purpose is to be obedient to God’s commandment to tell the message of truth. As he has commanded this message to be delivered, by his grace we will do it, regardless of opposition ; and when we have thus done, our responsibility ends and yours begins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reverse of this must, of course, also be true: until we have completely delivered the message our responsibility continues. How are we to know whether we have completed delivering the message or not? One sure indication that we have not completed delivering the message to the meek is the fact that Jehovah is providing us With new and more pointed messages as time goes on. The most forceful and pointed message ever delivered since our Lord himself was upon the earth was delivered over the nation-wide chain broadcast on March 25. Our responsibility is not over until this and similar messages provided by Jcho-</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Bound Books Should</span><br><br><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Be Offered</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout the land the brethren have been doing splendid work with booklets, placing the brief, pointed message contained therein with many people. The special testimony periods have emphasized booklet placements, and the result has been a wide witness to Jehovah’s name and to the accomplishment of his purpose in dividing the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, however, the workers must not forget to offer bound books to the people, and especially should the message In book form be emphasized by all between now and “The Nations’ Hope” Testimony Pebiod, June 30 to July 8. You recall the good results obtained in offering </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font5"> to the people, and know that bound books can be placed if pushed, and the enthusiastic presentation of the message in the books should be stressed by all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The time has come for the Lord's people to work speedily in carrying <sub>: </sub>the message of the Kingdom to the honest-hearted. It is the duty and responsibility of each one of the ' , Lord’s anointed to turn and give bis attention and aid to the honest-hearted in preparing them for the Lord’s protection in Armageddon. To do this the I.ord has adequately supplied us with literature revealing his requirements right up to the minute. The response on the part of the honest-hearted during the past few months has been remarkable, and undoubtedly will continue thus until Jehovah wipes the enemy from the face of the earth. Let each one in the Lord’s organization, then, whether pioneer, auxiliary, company worker or sharpshooter, recognize that he has a definite responsibility In his respective place in the Lord’s organization and put forth every effort, particularly during this special period, to give the message contained in the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">World Recovery? the</span><span class="font5"> widest possible circulation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Lord blessed the pioneers and it was possible for 186 throughout the country to attend this convention. Brethren came from all parts of the United States. There were representatives there from 28 states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The big event of the convention was the public meeting addressed by Brother Rutherford. There were 1,000,000 invitations distributed in Los Angeles and vicinity immediately prior to this tremendous assembly. Approximately 12,000 people packed out two auditoriums. The interest shown by those present was very marked. The audience paid rapt attention and at the conclusion was in full harmony and voted unanimously for the resolutions. It must have been thrilling for those who were there, and a moment they will never forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those also who heard the lectures, “World Control” and “Requirements”, over the radio were thrilled, and their joy was expressed in scores of telegrams being sent to Brother Rutherford from all parts of the world and all states in the Union,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many things that happened at the convention which would be of real interest. The opposition made themselves manifest. Brethren were interfered with in some parts by the police, but the Lord continued to protect and direct his people in carrying on the witness work. This convention undoubtedly is another milestone in the history of the church at the end of the age, and the work that the Lord desired to have accomplished there has been done to his glory and his praise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Many, however, were unable to hear the broadcast at that time, and have asked if it might be repeated on the air. We are happy to announce that the lecture will be repeated, and that by electrical transcription, on Sunday May 13, 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many stations that were not or could not be in the March 25 chain broadcast will cooperate in sending forth the message of “World Control” to their listeners on May 13. Tell your friends and neighbors to plan on listening to that broadcast. Some 1.00 stations will carry this lecture at that date, and you will shortly know which station in your community will be on.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font5"> pioneer working in company territory that is gone over periodically, as is the case In company assignments, recently wrote: “1 am finding many people who have never before seen the books. I am looking for a greater demand for the books, and if the workers earnestly apply themselves, the Lord will surely bless them.” Another recommends using a combination of hoth books and booklets in those instances where a combination of several books is not taken. Instead of dropping down to the booklets at once, he increased placements by offering 13 booklets and a bound</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">We Are Still After That 100,000 Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last summer the transcription machine work got under way. During the past winter the machines have been put to good use, and a wide witness given, in spite of severe weather. Spring now finds more than 450 machines in the hands ?f r&quot; the brethren in this country. Orders are coming in steadily, and machines are being shipped as rapidly as the material can be obtained and assembled, The campaign is clearly outlined in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Your Work with Transcription Machines.</span><span class="font5"> Should not this spring season, with more open roads and possibilities of outdoor meetings, enable the transcription work to go ahead with vigor and enthusiasm, and the quota of 100,000 audience each month to be far exceeded? It is up to those having machines to keep them busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the very enthusiastic letter of a pioneer;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For the past nine months I have been using a transcription machine, and now am desirous of expressing my thanks for this additional means of spreading the truth among the people,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Lord has provided the machine just at the opportune time. Especially wonderful has it been in rural sections where there are few radios. The people certainly enjoy the elear-eut and forceful lectures given by Brother Rutherford. When an area has been thoroughly covered by the transcription lectures the witness work has been greatly facilitated. Those who appreciate the lectures more readily acquire the literature when we call at their homes. Considerable literature 1 &quot;is been placed on the strength of <sub>tj</sub>. lectures. On many occasions people obtain literature at our meetings, chiefly booklets, and then when we call at their homes they are ready for more literature. Only a few weeks ago a man took the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fdscape </span><span class="font5">booklet at a meeting we held on the courthouse lawn on Saturday. While he was reading the booklet Sunday his pastor came around and ordered him to destroy it. 'The man refused; told his pastor he would get more when we came to his home. And he did. Took four books. He said the lectures were the finest and most enlightening sermons he had ever heard. This is only one of many such experiences showing the effectiveness of the transcription lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In addition to helping us place literature by arousing the people’s interest, tho transcription lectures are a powerful force In destroying prejudice. We have found people who were in opposition to the work, due principally to misrepresentation by the clergy, and who, after hearing a few lectures, became very friendly and interested. Many people have believed the false charges of the clergy, and refused to have anything to- do with us or the literature. Now, however, the honest ones are hearing' the truth by means of transcription machines and are getting their eyes open as to^. has been misleading them.” v-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several have built their own transcription machines and have borrowed records and other supplies without letting this office know they have machines. Brethren who have built machines that satisfactorily reproduce the transcription lectures and who are willing to use them two or more times a week in the witness work should promptly write us, so that their machines will be registered here, and they can receive instructions direct from the Society.</span></p>

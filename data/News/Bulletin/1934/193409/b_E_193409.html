<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>What Part Have You in This Witness Work?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">People Appreciate</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the Phonograph Lectures</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The transcription work with the phonograph in another means Jehovah has provided ior ills witnesses to use in pointing the people to the Righteous Ruler, in whose name they may hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Letters from pioneers already using phonographs show Jehovah’s blessing on their efforts, and will be of great interest to all, calling the attention of other brethren to the privilege of joining in this service:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Our first record was put on at the depot before we brought our machines home. The first day in the service with our machines we gave lectures to 85 people. At one country store 30 people gathered around. Besides all this, we placed more liters Lure than we had for some time. We were out 9£ hours and regretted going in.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“To large and small houses alike goes the phonograph giving testimony with joyous success. So far all have been glad to give their permission to run Ilie lectures. Almost without exception they have asked, that another be played. When literature is presented they want to learn more of what they have heard, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">thus the phonograph is a wonderful aid in placing books and booklets. I ran the record ‘Armageddon’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font3">a lady yesterday and she said, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Our </span><span class="font3">preacher hasn’t told us about that. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font3">doesn’t </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">tell </span><span class="font3">us any thing much about the Bible at all.’ &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“. . . They thought it a wonderful privilege to- have a talk such as they heard brought to their door. They had no money, but contributed some canned vegetables for a book and 6 booklets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I am delighted with it and appreciate the Lord's provision for me in making it possible for me to have one of them. I had long prayed that I might some day be able to get one of ttie machines and share in that part of the work. He surely answers our prayers when we pray aright.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I hope that each one doing Kingdom work will carry one in his car. Because of not being strong physically I felt a bit anxious, fearing that I might not be able to carry the machine, but found to my delight I can walk away with it with very little effort. I feel that the most delicate among the pioneers c-nn carry it for a short distance at least. A lady told me she had read some of our books hut couldn’t get straightened out on the soul and condition of the dead. These lectures did more to make the subjects clear than I eould by talking all day.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We have taken them right along in the field with us and have found them </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> great assistance </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">placing books and booklets. In </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">working </span><span class="font3">a little feed mill, In which six people were present, we put two lectures on. It caused Quite a bit of interest, and we placed 3 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font3"> and 12 booklets. Without the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">machine </span><span class="font3">we would probably not have placed anything, for in n place like tins it has in times past been hard to get their attention; but the machine did the work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The phonograph came, and I must say it is wonderful. I find it the most effective method of getting the attention of the people yet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Wo cannot hear Brother Rutherford's words without lining inspired to go on in this Kingdom work,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is manufacturing phonographs such as these brethren are using, and is glad to supply them to anyone for use in the Kingdom service at $19.25, including 18 lectures recorded on 9 discs, remittance to accompany order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many have asked about the needles they should use. For best results use phonograph needles, changing for each lecture. Needles may be obtained from the Society for 10c per package of 100; 5 packages for 25e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Service Leaders</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Following the usuai custom the factory and office will be closed on the two Saturdays of &quot;The Kingdom Praise Period&quot;, September 29 and October 6, to permit the family to have four full days for field service. Companies within a radius of 200 miles of New York- will be supplied with service leaders from Bethel, on request, on either of these week-ends, with the understanding that the local brethren there will participate in the Held service wit.h the service leader on both Salurday and Sunday. If you wish a service leader, send in your request early.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Recommendations for Service Director</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As outlined in the letter of July Ifj sent to all organized service companies, all the company recommendations for service director for 1935 are to he sent </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">to the Society by September </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1, </span><span class="font3">at the very </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">latest. We </span><span class="font3">urge each company that has </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">not yet </span><span class="font3">done so to give this matter immediate attention, and that the secretary promptly send in the recommen</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">dation blank,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Millions of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Booklets Are Now Ready for Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Door-to-Door Witness and Transcription Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Should Exceed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All Previous Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">On </span><span class="font3">the 29 Hi of September The Kingdom Phaish Period begins, and ends Sunday, October 7. Brother Rutherford has written a letter to his brethren setting out clearly the importance of this period, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font3">we hope you have carefully read. This letter is it real comfort </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">the anointed and spurs them on to greater zeal. It is an inspiration to all of Ilie Jonadab class, too, helping them to see their great privilege and responsibility in having a personal part in bearing to others the message of truth with which Jehovah has so greatly blessed them. The responsibility of taking the message contained in the. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler </span><span class="font3">booklet to the people rests upon everyone who knows Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> has clearly pointed out, &quot;the name ‘Jehovah’s witnesses’ applies specifically </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">God's anointed ones who have been taken out of the world and made witnesses for Jehovah, and these alone bear the new name. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">Jona-dab class are all those who 'hear' the message of truth and who must say to those in their hearing, ‘Come. And let him that lieareth sa.y, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.' (Rev. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">22: </span><span class="font3">17) Those of the Jonadab class must go along with those who are of the antitypicul Jehu company, that is, the anointed, and announce the message of the kingdom, even though they are not the anointed witnesses of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is evident, therefore, that upon every one who loves Jehovah, whether he he of the “bride” or of the Jonadab class, young or old, there falls the responsibility of telling others concerning the Righteous Ruler, the One who will vindicate Jo-■ hovah’s name and word. Each one </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">J </span><span class="font3">should make an extraordinary effort to inform others of the fact that soon this government under the Righteous Ruler, Christ Jesus, will control the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A New Booklet</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler,</span><span class="font3"> beantifully illustrated hy its front cover, contains a message of utmost Importance, that of &quot;Flee Now” and “World Control”. It is essential that the ‘millions of people who will never die’ obtain this message, as well as the “prisoners” who are held in the prison houses. It is incumbent upon us to see to it that this message of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jeho</span><span class="font3">vah is placed in their hands, so that they may know the proper </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">course </span><span class="font3">to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Be sure to get a supply of these booklets from the company or direct from the Society. If you have not in past times joined in this service work, use the coupon printed elsewhere In this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and ob</span><span class="font3">tain a supply of literature anti‘some territory and join in the greatest work that was ever carried on tn this earth, namely, advertising the King and the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The organized companies throughout tlie United States will carry on the work chiefly in thickly populated areas anti small outlying towns, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font3">that it will enable the workers to get in many testimonies and not lose much time. It is well not to work the rurals during this period, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font3">rather call on as many people as possible. 'The pioneers who are working in isolated territory should also choose cities and towns, and it is not necessary for these to confine iheir activities to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler, </span><span class="font3">but tins booklet should be </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">included </span><span class="font3">in every combination. Due to the fact that pioneers are working </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in terri</span><span class="font3">tory that is not called on so often, it is well for them to offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font3"> with other books and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler.</span><span class="font3"> The company workers, auxiliaries and Jonadabs should </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">devote </span><span class="font3">their time chiefly to the presentation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Ki nguom Praise Period starts a new year for the Watch Tower Bililc &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and it will be the first report entered for the fiscal year of 1935. As we enter into this joyous occasion bringing </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to a </span><span class="font3">close a tremendous witness for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">year 1934, we can look forward with renewed zeal and greater determination to start the new year off with a bang. Millions of these booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font3">now in (he liands of the workers, not only in the English, hut in many other tongues. This campaign will lie carried on in all the continents, in almost every country of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During tlie last international testimony period there were representatives in 83 countries who reported their activity, and nearly four million testimonies were given in nine days. Literature was distributed to the number of 1.561,242 pieces. A </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page S, column S)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention a Great Blessing to All</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">702 Pioneers and Auxiliaries Attend</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Splendid Witness Given at Toronto</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Toronto convention of Jehovah’s witnesses has come and gone, but its influence and the joy and enthusiasm which filled to overflowing all who attended will continue with them as they return to their homes more than ever deter- j mined to serve Jehovah, their God, alone, whatever the cost. There were over 4,000 delegates—large numbers of American brethren, many from as far a.wny as Iowa, Call-: fornia and Texas; and in Canada the friends came from British Columbia on the west mid from Cape Breton on the east. Newfoundland, too, was represented. There was a wonderful representation of pioneers and auxiliaries, 551 coming from the United States and 148 from Canada. Many of these brethren, being poor in this world's goods, had great difficulties to overcome, but they left no stone unturned in their efforts to get to Toronto, some even hitch-hiking their way. All, however, were enthusiastic in their testimony that the blessings received more than made up for any hardships endured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There were, on the average, 1,380 workers in 1he field each day, the peak number for any one day being over l,7iJO, and during the four days of the convention 15,368 hours were put in in the field work, 186,384 testimonies were delivered, and 23,561 books and booklets were placed in 21,927 homes in Toronto and vicinity. The field work was well organized, the territory' within a radius of 60 miles receiving the witness, the city of Toronto being covered completely once and practically n 11 of it the second time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">'The important event of Ibe convention was Brother Rutherford’s public address, “Flue Now which was simultaneously broadcast over a number of stations in the United States and heard throughout this country' as well us in many parts of Canada. An extraordinary effort had been put forth to thoroughly advertise this meeting, for which the largest and most modern auditorium in Toronto, having a seating capacity of 16,000, had been engaged. 175,000 handbills and 120,000 personal letters of invitation were distributed in Toronto and vicinity just prior to this tremendous assembly ; 300 large signs were displayed on the front of the street ears; 92 automobiles carrying large signs 3' by 12&lt; mounted on top and stretching from back to front, paraded through the streets at fixed hours throughout the convention, and hundreds of other automobiles carried smaller signs and banners; more than 2,000 window cards were displayed in stores in various parts of the city; and the newspapers carried prominent advertisements. City officials were heard to remark that never before had they seen such a display of splendid banners advertising any meeting. As a result, a magnificent crowd turned out to hear the lecture, numbers motoring in, from within a ratlins of 100 miles. There were at least 12,000 admitted to the auditorium and many were turned away after the lecture hml slatted. In addition great numbers tuned in at home and heard the message over the air. It was reported that motoring along the highways leading out of Toronto almost every radio was heard to be carrying Brother Rutherford’s lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of outstanding interest and inspiration to liie brethren was Brother Rutherford’s address on Saturday afternoon based on the third chapter of Ilanieh As at last the wonderfully clear’ and satisfying exposition of this picture of the three Hebrews and the fiery furnace was brought forth, It thrilled the hearts of all present, wiio by their enthusiastic applause from time to time manifested their determination to continue to serve Jehovah our God and to refuse to serve or bow down to Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Conlirtucd from pti&lt;/e column &lt;}) </span><span class="font3">year ago, during the Kingdom: Pitoc-lamatiox IbiBiOD, September 30 to October 8, there were 1,572,631 pieces of literature distributed, and 3,668,766 testimonies given. These are two marks to alm at, and, by the Lord’s grace, to exceed, to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name. An increase in the. distribution of the witness—greater activily on the part of the Lord’s people and the Jbna-dabs—means our having a greater part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the regular report that will be sent in for this period, the companies, pioneers, sharpshooters and auxiliaries having transcription machines or phonographs should make a special report for this period of nine days. Mark on the regular report card that Is sent in for the witness period the number of meetings, number of lectures, and the total ri.ti.ernlance at meetings held with phonographs or transcription machines during this period. This is a special report we are taking for this international period. Countries throughout the world are sending in this same report, and it will be very luteresting to note how many testimonies arc given, as well as how many hear the lectures ■T-Xeb Now” and “World Control”, and other lectures, through the transcription method. These two lectures, however, will be used particularly during this period. Make every effort to keep your niacliines busy and inform the people that it is now the time to flee and that soon the world will he controlled by a righteous ruler. 'This special report made for the transcription work should be included in your regular monthly report the same as the workers’ report is included in tlie monthly report sent in to this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Testimony</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The testimony card enclosed herewith should be used by each individual in the witness work during this period especially. This brings to the reader a clear, concise message which each one should have at this time. Present them with the booklet Righteous Rijlli;, so that they may share the blessings which have already comforied you. Now is the time for all who have hope in the name of Jehovah to press on and take upon themselves the responsibility of preaching this gospel of the Kingdom so that others may enjoy what you already have been feasting upon. Let Tim Kingdom PiiAiSB Peutoii be a period of more workers, more hours, more testimonies, more placements, more literature, in fact, the greatest witness ever given in a period of nine days. What greater joy could one । have in his existence on this earth , than to be a willing and obedient i servant of the Most High, the only-true God, whose name alone is Jehovah?</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Reporting Phonograph Activities</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">'flic phonographs and records are to be used as often as possi ble in the field and on other occasions, and every worker should keep n record of all meetings and report regularly. While company workers report to the director, pioneers and auxiliaries report direct to the Society on the regular pink report card. They are to send but one report card each month, showing all field work, including placements at all meetings, and also including their transcription report. The new pink cards have spaces provided for the transcription report, and all pioneers and auxiliaries using phonographs or transcription machines, or phonograph records on local machines, who do not have these cards should order a supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only one individual is to report on any one machine. All Irunserip-lion work, whether by phonograph or transcription machine, is to be combined and reported as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Machines”: Total number used during the month (not the serial number of the machine). &quot;Lee! ares” :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I Total number of lectures run. “Meetings”: Report all meetings held, regardless of whether one or many attend. &quot;Attendnnee” : Total u.l tendance at all meetings, regardless of number present, whether it is one or a hundred.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">DEPOTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society's supply depot at Oakland, California, has been disconlin-iicii, and depots located at Seattle. Washington, and Los Angeles, California, will take its place. The address of each of these is as follows: Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, 517 West 9th SI.., Los Angeles, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, 800 Broadway, Seattle, Wash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The supply depot at St. Louis, ' Missouri, remains the same as heretofore. the address being IIS. New-slead Ave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">None of these depots arc equipped to handle correspondence, and we ask that the brethren send all correspondence to the Brooklyn office. Grily when a RUSH order is needed should the order be sent to a depot. Always try to anticipate your needed supply of literature fur enough in advance to send your order to Brooklyn and allow it to be routed in the most economical way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The message disclosing Jehovah’s Vindicator, in whose name alone the people can have certain hope, is reaching the ears of an increasingly large audience hearing the lectures of Brother Rutherford made available through the transcription machines. Of greatest interest is the April report of actual work and results. You know a total attendance of 100,000 persons a month litis been hoped for. During the six months ending with March the total was 505,785, a splendid showing for the most unfavorable season of the year, but not an average of 100,000 ‘ monthly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">April’s report realizes this temporary quota, the total attendance ■ for the month being 100,979. Here ■JMjdie report of all machines:</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark8"><span class="font3">Average attendance per meeting</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font3">Average number of meetings per machine 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The attendance in the future depends on the number ot meetings held. An average of eight meetings a month is shown for the machines reporting during ApriL Each machine was thus used about two times a week. This is the minimum number of meetings to be held with a machine; and in proportion to I he increase hi meetings an increase in total attendance will be forthcoming. The attendance per meeting varies greatly, but. when the totals are considered we find the pioneers and auxiliaries report an average of 31, and companies 27. Now, if, instead of each machine's being run two times during a week, it be used at three meetings, the proportionate increase will bring the attendance to 150,000 monthly. This, together with the advantage of summer weather, and the additional machines steadily going to the brethren, should really be exceeded, and At earnestly hope that the summer tJbI see 200,000 persons receiving the-’'message of hope by the transcription lectures monthly. It is a privilege for those with the machines to keep them busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Consistent presentation of the literature with the transcription lectures will continue the increase in placements at the meetings. Such placements are to Ik? included in the regular monthly reports, as well as on the special transcription machine reports.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Brother Rutherford to Attend Convention</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">All of the brethren in the east will be interested to’know that they, too, will have an opportunity of attending a convention at which Brother Rutherford will be present. Los Angeles was too far away for the eastern brethren, but. Toronto, Canada, Is conveniently located for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first meeting will be on Thursday evening, July 5, and the convention will continue through to July 8. Every morning will be set aside for Held service iti Toronto and vicinity. Speakers will bo there from the United Slates, as well as those brethren who have served the companies in Canada. It will be a splendid opportunity for those brethren traveling a little distance to do their traveling on July 4 and arrive in Toronto on the 5th, early enough to participate iu field work that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This being the close of “The Nations’ Hope” Testimony Period, everyone attending the convention will want to put in considerable time in the witness work. Arrangements have been made for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All of those contemplating attending the convention and who desire accommodations will please address Convention Committee, 40 Irwin Ave., Toronto 5, Ont., Canada.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Read Carefully</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Would it be a comfort to you to know that there is a real and complete cure for all the ills that now afflict the peoples of the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The rulers of every nation have offered various remedies, all of which have failed, and the people continue to suffer. Almost everyone is asking, What will be the end of these troubles, and is there a possibility of recovery? The cause of the trouble must be known in order to understand the remedy. Centuries ago Jehovah God by his prophets foretold these troublous times, stated the cause thereof, and told what would be the complete remedy for the distress nowon the world. This booklet contains that information which you should have. Only five cents contributed would not only provide you with the desired information but will help to print more booklets that others may be made glad. This is your copy, and, of course, you will do your part.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">One feature of the convention will be a public address delivered by the president of the Society on Sunday afternoon, the 8th of July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those brethren within a few hundred miles of Toronto who cannot be there the full time will surely make every efl’orl lo be there Saturday and Sunday so as to have part in the work of witnessing and attending these meetings, which will be a real joy and aid to the brethren in pressing on in Ilie light.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Don’t Talk Too Much</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">An English brother who objects to using the printed testimony writes: &quot;Result of using the printed testimony at yesterday's effort was disastrous, 4 booklets only being placed. With last drive placed 50. With this printed testimony- the people stopped me before I had read half way through it.&quot; To this the office replied: “Why should you read the testimony at all? The iieople are. able to read. The purpose of the printed testimony is to afford them an opportunity to read. Let them read, and do not interrupt them while they are reading.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">During &quot;The Nations’ Hope” Testimony Period the anointed will again have the blessed privilege of participating in a special witness with the new booklet World </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Recovery?</span><span class="font3"> Brother Rutherford lias written the following testimony, which is being printed on a card that will fit the celluloid holders which the Society has been supplying for the past few months, and is sent to all companies. The use of the card has proved so sa tis factory (hat we again urge that everyone hand to the person who comes to the door this card to read, and also hand him a copy of tbebook-1 e t. The testimony printed herewith, if cut out and pasted on a card, can also fit<sup>1 </sup>used.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“The Nations’ Horn” Testimony Period, June 30 to July 8, brings to God’s people another special period where all will have an opportunity to go forward and raise their voice in unity to the praise of his name. There are now 21 million copies of She booklet World </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Recovery?</span><span class="font3"> ready for the special witness. Shipments have been made to all English-speaking countries, and, by the Lord’s grace, there will be a mighty proclamation. Again all who are athirst may drink of the waler of life freely. Those who are drinking may say, “Come.” A printed Testimony has been prepared for the aid of the workers, so that every one, without excuse, can now join in the witness for the Kingdom. All who heard the lecture &quot;Requirements” given by Brother Rutherford from Los Angeles following the public address on March 25 and also heard it over the transcription machines throughout the world must be impressed with the responsibility that now rests upon the anointed. Some of the outstanding points presented in that lecture are here called to your attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Within a short time now God's name will be vindicated at the battle of Armageddon, and then the way of life will be open to the peoples of earth; bur before that God requires that his people now on the earth bear testimony concerning his name, his purpose, and his kingdom, and the ones upon whom God has laid this obligation who fail or refuse to be wholly obedient thereto shall die without any hope of resurrection. Lawlessness or disobedience willno longer be tolerated. .. . Nowit is the privilege am] duty of Jehovah's witnesses under commandment from Hie Lord to point the people to God’s King and kingdom as the only remedy for suffering humanity and say to them ; Tn his name shall the nations hope? ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This great privilege conferred upon his anointed during tlie special period, June 30 to July 8, words are inadequate to describe. Only those who participate in it and taste of Ihe blessing Jehovah has for bis witnesses therein can really realize what it means. Let each one, by the Lord's grace, go forward during this period and, as suggested in the last </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font3"> try to put in 15 or 20 hours in the service, using the two Saturdays and two Sundays, the Fourth of July find every other available </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Two New Booklets</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Beyond the Grave His Works</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">They keep right on coming. One new booklet niter another. This time it is two at once. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Beyond the Grave</span><span class="font3"> is a most interesting booklet, as well as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bia Works.</span><span class="font3"> Both of these, having been written by Brother Rutherford, will find a great appeal amongst the people at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Orders can be placed Immediately by the companies, pioneers, auxiliaries, and sharpshooters, and as soon as these Iwo new booklets arc received they can lie used in the regular witness work. Hundreds of thousands of these booklets should be placed during the summer months. In these hard times, when people have but few pennies, it has been found well to offer them booklets, and these will bring hope and comfort to suffering immunity. Order now and put them in tire hands of the people as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Transferring Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There have recently been so many requests from sharpshooters, companies, auxiliaries and pioneers for us to make charges and credits on the different accounts for literature which these brethren have turned over to one another that it seems necessary to again call attention to the policy of the Society In this regard, and we are certain that all the workers will be glad to cooperate and conform to this policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No company director, stockkoeper, pioneer, auxiliary or sharpshooter is to turn over any books or booklets to another company, pioneer, auxiliary or sharpshooter and expect an adjustment to be made on the accounts at tins office without first receiving from this office permission for the transfer of stock to be made. There are many reasons why it might not be advisable for the literature to be turned over and the account charged. So try not to turn literature over to someone else and then write in asking for your account to be credited and the other account charged. It a pioneer or auxiliary nine short of books before his order arrives from headquarters, and the need of borrowing a few from the local company or another auxiliary or pioneer is felt, then replace the same at once upon l lie arrival of the shipment. Do not write to us and ask us to transfer the books from one account to another. Company witnesses should get their stock from the local service organization, not from pioneers or auxiliaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from pane 1, column</span><span class="font3"> 41 moment to lift your voice to the praise of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Companies who have worked their city territory three or four or more times during the past winter should now concentrate in working their rurals, and, in order to make the testimonies, considerably more time must be put in than in the city, but the weather and other conditions are now so favorable for country work that this can be accomplished without a great fiardship on anyone. Companies who have not covered their city territory two or three times during the past six months may concentrate on their city territory, in order that a wider and more effective witness may be given to the praise of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore let all toward whom the new covenant has been inaugurated and all others who love Jehovah go forward with joy using their faculties to the glory of his name during this special period, and continue thereafter as opportunity affords.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">12-lncb Phonograph Witness Records</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Five-Minute Talks by Brother Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Rutherford bas made special records for use in the home. This is something that a good many of the brethren as well as the people of good will have desired tor some time. Having phonographs in their homes, many have requested records that could be used on these jihonographs so that their friends and neighbors could hear the dearly expressed truths of the Lord as set forth by Brother Rutherford. Now we have them. These 12-ineli records run approximately five minutes each, and in that space of time there is more said concerning the Bible ami God’s purposes than Ilie clergy say in a lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Batteries for</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many of the. brethren having bal.tery-type transcription machines which were manufactured by Sound Systems, Inc. have been writing to us about, getting replacement batteries. We can furnish batteries to the brethren, either separate batteries or tlie complete set, at the regular manufacturer's list price. Due to the small discounts and the shipping charges, we are unable to furnish these butteries at any reduction, You can therefore obtain batteries at the same, cost in your own community, provided they carry them in stock. However, in smaller cities and towns you may not be able to get absolutely fresh batteries, and we can guarantee that the ones we will furnish will be fresh. The following are the prices separately and in complete sets:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark27"><span class="font1">Type No. 480 45 volt IS battery</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark28"><span class="font1">Typo No. 7G8 221 volt Cbattery</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark29"><span class="font1">Type No. 783 15-volt C battery</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark30"><span class="font1">Type No. 711114-volt A battery</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sound Systems, Inc. machines Nos. 1000 to 1123 use (3) type No. 486 B batteries, (1) typo No. 768 C battery, and (4) type No. 7111 A batteries. The cost for the complete set Is $10.10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sound Systems, Tnc. machines Nos. 1124 onward use (3) type No. 486 B batteries, (1) type No. 783 C buttery, and (8) type No. 7111 A batteries. The cost for the complete set is $11.95,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Home on Wheels</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tlie Society gathered together a great number of practical suggestions from pioneers who have constructed and used house-cars and trailers and published this information in the special bulletin </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Building a Home on Wheels,</span><span class="font3"> which was mailed to tlie brethren throughout the country. We have a good supply of those bulletins on hand at this office and shall be glad to send a copy to any of the brethren who wish to build trailers or house-care for the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">J. w. Cards</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In view of the fact that the brethren throughout the country are using the printed testimony exclusively, the demand for calling cards has dropped off entirely; and we believe that this is wise, because if you present the people too many things they have so many things to handle and study that they pay very little attention to any one of them. Therefore the J. w. calling cards are permanently out of stock; they will not be reprinted,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now, when you have some company, put on one or two of these records, and a discussion on the purposes of the Lord will soon be in progress and a good witness can bo given, as well as literature placed setting out in detail the work that Jehovah is doing in regard to the vindication of his name, Every one of the brethren who has a phonograph that con be run at 78 revolutions per minute should get a set of these 12 records, which are on six discs. Each disc is offered at 70c each, or all six for only $3.50. Send your order to tlie Walch Tower with remittance to cover, as these are not chargeable to accounts. This is another splendid means of proclaiming the message of tlie Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Leaders for Testimony Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To permit the Bethel family Io spend four full days in the field during “The Nations’ Hope” -testimony Period, the office and factory will be closed all day on Saturday June 30 and Saturday July 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As heretofore, service lenders from Bethel will be sent to work with companies within 200 miles of Brooklyn upon special request from the companies. Requests for tlie visits of these brethren should he sent to the service department at once, and when writing', state if the visit is desired for the first weekend of the period or the second Saturday and Sunday,</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Great Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The transcription work in the British Isles is progressing nicely. There are now 200 transcription machines in operation in that country, and during the month of March a total of 23,962 people attended the transcription meetings. During April there was a big increase, the tots! attendance for that month being 32,326. That is a flue audience, and we hope that this phase of the work will continue to increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Europe</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A report has just been received for Northern Europe for the first seven mouths of 1934 and it Is far ahead of the same period last year.

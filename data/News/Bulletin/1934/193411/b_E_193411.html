<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sound Machines Bring Comfort</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the witness with the transcription lectures by means of the phonographs and transcription machines progresses, the field for this work is seen to widen continually and there appears to be no limit to the possibilities of this method in seeking out those of good will. Prom the field workers come many reports showing specifically an increase in placements of books and booklets where the phonograph has been used. Examples: “At our first meeting we had </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">j</span><span class="font3">4 present besides ourselves, and we placed 17 bound volumes in 15 minutes.” “A lady read the testimony and said, ‘I can’t agree with Judge Rutherford, and I don’t want any more of Ills books.' After listening to four lectures and asking a few questions her husband took </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prepa.ralion</span><span class="font3"> ami 7 booklets and a neighbor lady also took </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation </span><span class="font3">and 6 booklets. Similar occurrences happen almost every day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The placement of literature at a meeting, however, is not the entire measure of tire meeting’s value, nor is such the end of the phonograph's use at any one place. Repeated meetings for the same group are most valuable, and where workers are in one territory indefinitely, as is the ease with all territories except those of isolated pioneers, return meetings should be arranged for at every opportunity. At ah meetings with the phonographs the people should be directed to the central transcription machine meetings in the territory, and also Io the regular studies of the company. In this way the field</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">No Consignments Are Being Made</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Orders Are Extraordinarily Heavy</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you have not as yet placed your order for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Angels</span><span class="font3"> booklet, do it immediately, so that you will be sure to have a good supply of these booklets on hand for the special testimony period in November. Order blanks were sent out some time ago, so that you could order the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Angels </span><span class="font3">booklets with other literature. This should lie done, as it saves money in the shipping of freight orders. Service directors, sharpshooters, pio-service with the literature, transcription machine work, studies, and phonograph service, work together, bringing those of the good will class close to the organization of the Lord’s people. This close contact cannot be gained by a mere superficial covering of the territory and an indifferent attitude toward those manifesting interest. “It behooves each one of Jehovah’s witnesses to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">aid</span><span class="font3"> others to understand these truths who have a desire to know<sup>7</sup> and to serve Jehovah God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brethren in the United States have several thousand ears which they use in the field service, and every one of these cars should be equipped with a phonograph. Such would put a great many more phonographs in the work. Not only should these machines be part of the equipment available to all the workers, but they must be kept busy. Having the machine right with him, the worker can go ahead and run it on occasions when permission for a later meeting could not be obtained. &quot;Some friends have machines which stand idle because the brethren go about asking the prospects if they want to hear a lecture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Phonograph records are now in stock again, and your orders for these and phonographs can be filled promptly. Several orders for transcription machines are still being held, awaiting the manufacture of machines to ship. This work is being done as rapidly as other activities permit, and we want the brethren with such orders in to know they are not forgotten.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Message of Greatest Importance</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Sebvant's Testimony Period, </span><span class="font3">November 24 to December 2, this year should prove to be a most blessed and significant time in the Lord’s service. The Lord has graciously provided us with a message that reveals the machinations of the Devil and his organization as nothing else has done up to the present. A. citation from the October 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> gives us a wonderful picture of our privileges and responsibilities in this connection now: “The Devil tried to hide from ‘Christendom’ knowledge even of the existence of himself, and also the fact of the existence of his -organization. By this means he expected to entrap them all. Now Jehovah causes Satan’s organization to be brought to light, and causes his own witnesses to give testimony concerning the same, particularly as a warning to all people of good will, and as a notitre and warning to the nations of the earth in general.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Angels,</span><span class="font3"> which will be used during this period, contains the •clearest description we have had of the operation of the invisible part of the Devil’s organization and how it Ims been used to debauch both men and angels and turn them aside from fully obeying Jehovah. The Servant's Testimony Period is set aside for the distribution of this booklet. Our commission and author</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Many Pioneers Moving</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Toward Atlanta</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has richly blessed the brethren in the United States with service conventions. Early in the year a convention was held in the West, and then the Canada convention in the North; and now there ity to act now<sup>7</sup>, taken from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and quoted in the last </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font3"> is here repeated, because it is very pointed. “It is undoubtedly the will of God that a witness concerning these unseen powers and the influence that they exercise over the human race must now be given.” This must be viewed ns organization instructions; which are not discretionary, but wholly mandatory. Therefore, let each one of the anointed and every person of good will accept this great privilege and responsibility and push the witness vigorously during this period, to the end that the Devil’s organization may be brought to light before all creation and that the name of Jehovah may be exalted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This campaign is to be vigorously carried on In .urban territory during The Servant’s Testimony Period. As many homes as possible should be reached with the message in the lime assigned. It is important that every intelligent creature on earth be given an opportunity to consider this issue as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The testimony to be used is that given on page 2 of the booklet. Take the following course of action; Introduce yourself in a kind and courteous manner, saying: “I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and I have here a message of very great importance. Will you kindly read it.” Open the booklet at page 2 and present it to the party right side up. After be lias read the testimony on that page, then say: “This message is of vital importance to everyone; this is your copy: you may contribute five cents to aid in a wider distribution of this very helpful message.”</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">I is one arranged for the brethren in the southern part of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Atlanta service convention will be held on November 23, 24 and 25; headquarters Ansley Hotel, roof ‘ garden. Meetings Saturday and Sun-! day will be held in the City Audi-। torium. These meetings will be ml-j dressed by various brethren, including the president of the Society,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is hoped that many of the pioneers in the South may be able to attend. Sleeping quarters are being provided for a hundred or more pioneers. Pioneers will make no arrangements for quarters until seeing convention committee. A credit ( of $25 will be allowed to each pioneer on book account to help pay ex-| peases to the convention. Let all the ; Lord’s people present this matter i before the throne of grace for his । blessing that there may be a splendid witness </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to the</span><span class="font3"> honor of his name.

<p><span class="font4">October Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Begins with September 29 and Includes October 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be Sure to Mail Report Cards</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We would also call attention to the fact that the report for the month of October is to include all the witness work done from September 29 to and including October 31. The October report is to include the work done daring The Kingdom Praise Period, September 29 to October 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While we are on reports we would suggest that each one spend a minute or two checking over his report cards before sending them in to this office. See that they are filled out properly, completely, and correctly. This will save much of the Tord's money that is now wasted in sending these cards back and forth for proper information, and also considerable of the Lord’s time that can be used effectively in other branches of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">South America a Good Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Do you know of some friends who would like to come and join me here in South America? I will do my best to help them. Here is religious freedom, and some take </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">hooks readily. The climate is good, and plenty of fruit and vegetables, anti anybody who likes to work can make a go out of it. The Lord has kept me through all the difficulties in these countries. Any information you may wish concerning the South American countries will be gladly furnished upon request.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The above is from a letter recently received from a sister now pioneering in Ecuador, South America. Those brethren who want to enter the pioneer work in South American countries may write the Society further.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRALIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘‘We are happy to report that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font3">have been able to arrange with twenty radio stations to broadcast Brother Butlrerford’s special lecture ‘Flee Now’. The majority of' the stations will be putting the lecture over on September 30, and we </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font3">confident that this will have a good effect on the placements of the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler</span><span class="font3"> during Kingdom Praise Period.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“There are a large number of Indians in the north here, many of whom are real friendly. On the whole, the Indians listen very attentively, and all who can obtain literature. In the absence of money, leather goods are offered—buckskin coats, gloves, moccasins, etc. We have had them sit about our camp fire until after midnight listening to an explanation of the truth, asking questions, etc. Their eyes would glisten with suppressed excitement as we told them of the Kingdom. We have not found much opposition except in some eases when the dominies told us, ‘This is our job.’ We advised them to get out of the sinking ship before it is too late.”— Pioneer, Northern British Columbia.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">customers hear. Last week made an appointment for three people to hear in their home; had a grand time; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Harp</span><span class="font3"> and two booklets left. Next day an auxiliary called, not knowing I had called the evening before; the lady read card, asked who the books were hy—if by Judge Rutherford she would have the three—mentioned how she enjoyed the records the night before. So the good work goes on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">BAHAMA ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ From a pioneer in the Bahama islands : “The transcription machine reached Arthur’s Town, and the message was appreciated by nearly all who heard. The people shout for joy, giving God thanks for the truth. One preacher is using the booklets in his church. He told me he saw the books contain nothing but the truth. He heard Brother Rutherford, and now ho is asking God to forgive him for all the wrong he was preaching. Then he said Christ died for the truth and ‘I will preach out of these books and let the people hear’. The lecture stirred the people, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Worn Recovery</span><span class="font3"> was meat in due season.<sup>1</sup>’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We now have three large transcription machines and four small portable machines. We find so many people who say, ‘I had the booklets, but did not know<sup>T</sup> that they contained anything like that.’ It certainly helps the people understand the message. The machines are doing a wonderful work in small towns and parks; for instance; There is a little town near here, where we never had success before, but. after six lectures the people would come out and sit around the speaker. Everyone from the banker down to the workingman. Later, when we called on the people with the combination of three booklets they were placed in every home with the exception of three. A week later it was covered with the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler</span><span class="font3"> with the same experience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“At this divisional campaign we laid special stress on the matter of procuring names of those whose homes were really open for transcription meetings. Considerable time was taken Saturday afternoon </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">impress this upon the minds of the workers. The result was that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font3">received the names of 30 people who definitely stated that their homes were open for the transcription </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">pur</span><span class="font3">poses.” --Division.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FRANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A pioneer in France reports the following incident:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One day he was giving testimony in tlie mayor’s office in M----, to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the mayor's secretary and stenographer. The secretary was </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">Catholic and had a rather surprising knowledge of the text of the Bible. The steno listened with interest </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">the discussion. Suddenly the secretary changed his attitude and began to act as if possessed by the very Devil. He blasphemed Jehovah and finished by saying, “Money is my god.”. The pioneer warned him that he could not mock God and go unpunished. The girl, however, took a booklet, and, through her, her mother later became interested. Two days after the incident in the mayor’s office the newspaper reported that there was a fire in the secretary’s</span></p>

Service leaders will be sent to companies within a radius of 200 miles who make request for them. Tlrere-fore, if you desire a service leader, please write promptly requesting one, stating at which end of the service period yon desire the brother to serve your company.

The next morning lie died after suffering horrible pains. ‘His god’ could not save him, but destroyed him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">EGYPT</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Our joy is great because almost all the brethren have sold their business to engage in the pioneer work. The Lord greatly hlessed our efforts during the last campaign to place his message in the hands of the people in printed form. The work is going on grandly, by the Lord’s grace. Send us as soon as possible more bound books and booklets. Alexandria is a cosmopolitan city and we need the message in different languages, that oil peoples may hear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">TURKEY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I am very thankful to Jehovah for the privilege I have to bring his message to the attention of the people.

<p><span class="font3">It makes us very happy to see the witness work expanding from time to time, which is just what the Lord has promised would happen, and the results &quot;of &quot;The Nations’ Hope” Testimony Period show another forward step in the progress of God’s kingdom. The booklet used during this campaign, World </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Recovery,</span><span class="font3"> was very timely. One scheme after another advanced by the country’s so-called “leaders” has failed, and more and more people are beginning to rea lize that there is no hope of “world recovery” in the schemes of men. “The nations’ hope” is in God’s righteous government, and, during the midsummer campaign just past, Jehovah’s witnesses and the Jona-dabs put forth a strenuous effort to let the people know about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The results of this campaign are given in the table below. It is very encouraging to note the big increase, in comparison with the corresponding period of last year. First, there is a great increase in the number of workers. This is just what we might expect, with many of our Jonadab brethren now participating in the Kingdom witness. Last year, during Ambassadors’ Devotional Period, July 1-9, there were 15,220 workers in tile field, and this year the total</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">If for any reason you run out of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rightaous Ruler</span><span class="font3"> booklet before the end of the campaign, do not cease activities because of this, but use some other booklet and push the campaign vigorously until the encl of the period. It has heen found on former occasions that some of the brethren, as soon as their special booklets for the period were completely disposed of, eeased activity entirely. This should not be. Make is 19,706; an increase of 4,486. These workers spent a total of 243,201 hours in the service, an increase of more than 30,000 hours over the previous year. The total of testimonies given, 1,549,308, is nearly double the number of the preceding year, which was 855,341. An average of approximately one out of three persons witnessed to took some literature, and the total of literature placed was 577,605; an increase of 220,927 over the preceding year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now that you have the results of the period just past, we hope that you will put forth every effort to malic the present period, The Kingdom Praise Pebiod, the greatest ever. This </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> will probably reach most of the workers during this international witness, and we hope everyone will be putting forth his best endeavors with the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Servant’s Testimony Period begins the new fiscal year of the Society; and, looking back over the past twelve months, we find a continual increase over the year 1933. Will 1935 bring a bigger and better witness ? And the answer we believe everyone will give is, ‘By the Lord’s grace, and his continued favor and loving-kindness, we will make the new year the best yet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Isn’t it a grand and glorious work, to let the people know that &quot;in His </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NAME SHALT, THE NATIONS HOPE” I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the campaign last the entire period set apart for if, and If you do not have enough of the special booklets assigned for that particular campaign, then use some other booklets.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Reporting Bibles</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Will all pioneers and auxiliaries, as well as all other workers, kindly report all Bibles they place as &quot;Other Books”, in making out their monthly and territory reports. Follow this practice instead of omitting Bibles from the monthly reports entirely, as has been the policy in the past.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Do You Have One?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Whenever Jehovah has provided some additional instrument to be used in bearing the Kingdom message to the people, the Devil has been quick to attempt to hinder, or to prevent the Lord’s people from responding to the opportunities thus presented. This is true of the use of the transcription lectures by means of phonographs. That the adversary fails in his efforts is shown by the hearty response of the brethren to this service, and Jehovah's rich blessing on their work. During the month of August the total attendance at all transcription meetings was 316,687; the largest of any month to date. The phonographs are a, supplement to the regular witness work of personal presentation of the literature. They carry the Kingdom instruction to the people, and aid in interesting those thus informed to the point of taking the literature presented at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The work now being done with phonographs is accomplished by those who have thus far taken advantage of this provision, and undoubtedly there are many more pioneers, auxiliaries, and company workers who can arrange to use this equipment if they see the privilege and importance of doing so. The phonograph does not replace the regular door-to-door presentation of the literature, but is in addition thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fact that the physical condition of some of the Lord's people is such that they cannot carry a weight of twenty pounds is recognized. However, even those thus handicapped can aid their fellow workers by finding openings for meetlugs, and even take part by supplying the records to people who already have machines of their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several problems naturally arise In carrying on this new work, and these must be recognized and overcome by each worker to the extent of his ability. One of these is the matter of territory in which phonographs can be used. A few workers in every type of territory, rural, residential and business, have had the fear that the phonograph will not work in their assignment, and that there is no use to try to use it. However, brethren in each of these different territories are making good use of the machines, and reaching many people therein. Concerning this a pioneer has written: “‘You can’t place books in my territory’ is seldom heard any more. We are walking by faith, and our first step is to be equipped with the instruments that the Lord has provided and then diligently and confidently seek opportunities to use them.” In considering and deciding what you will be able to do, you will be interested in what others are doing in LMs respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren in city territory and not having cars make appointments with interested ones they meet in the day’s work and call back, holding several lectures in one evening, the householders having invited friends and neighbors. Some carry the phonograph to the territory each day, and leave it at some store or other convenient place for immediate use during the noon hours where laborers are eating lunch, and at other opportunities. A worker with a ear may always have the machine handy, regardless of the type of territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is an unusual thing for business men to be called on by someone with both books and a phonograph; but this is now being done. Telling about his phonograph work in business territory a pioneer states: “To be sure, there is opposition against the truth everywhere, aud we can hardly expect otherwise. In spite of the opposition, I have run my phonograph in hotels, pool rooms, grocei’y stores, butcher shops, undertakers’ parlors, offices, and Catholic club houses. There is no limit to the possibilities for use of the phonograph in the business districts. Among my first set-ups was a Jewish business place. The attention was good. My territory is mostly Catholic. The Catholics have heen told that Judge Rutherford is against God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">clear-cut lectures are a revelation to them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The rurals, of course, offer numberless opportunities for the machine to be used, and every car should be equipped with a phonograph if this is possible. Where two or more workers are in one car it is entirely in order for them to use one machine together if they cannot keep more busy; but only one of the number should report the work, so that only the one machine will be shown as being used. The work should be so arranged that other members of the car group will not be held up wtii'e waiting for the one who is running the lectures; otherwise much of the effectiveness of the lectures is offset. At meetings with the transcription machine interested ones should be informed of the smaller machines available, and of their privilege of opening their homes to those.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And now a few words from some pioneers regarding phonographs: “At a recent meeting using the phonograph we had about 40 present. This was held at a country store and filling station, and the folks came in cars and wagons for</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">As you have noticed on the Society’s calendar tor 1934, the nine days of November 24 to December 2 are set aside as The Servant’s Testimony Period. You will need to begin to prepare for this period well in advance to have the necessary supply of booklets on hand, and the enclosed order hlank is for your convenience in ordering a good stock.

It is entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Angels,</span><span class="font3"> This subject means much to the Lord’s people now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In his due time Jehovah has revealed to his people vital facts concerning’ the invisible part of the Devil’s organization. Immediately thereaf ter, in obedience to Jehovah’s orders, ills people, by his grace, make this testimony period previously set aside the occasion to bear this information to others. Those who love Jehovah have this special and important work to do, and your hearty response to this service will enable you to join in Informing others concerning the wicked spirits, and standing as a theater or witness to the spirits in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our orders from Jehovah’s organization, in the words of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> are: “It Is undoubtedly the will of God that a witness concern-jng these unseen powers and the influence that they exercise over the human race must now be given, and that all who love the Lord must put forth their best endeavors to have a part in this witness work.” Thus the time Is here for the work to be done; The Servant’s Testimony Period opens the public witness against these unseen powers; and all who love the Lord will have part therein.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">County Reports of Transcription Work Discontinued</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Vve greatly appreciate the cooperation of pioneers and others in sending the record of portable transcription meetings held in various counties assigned to them at the time they have sent in their territory reports. This detailed information on the transcription county sheet, however, will not be necessary in the future. The new daily record sheets provide space for transcription work to be recorded each day, and this is to be reported on the regular monthly report card, combining phonograph and transcription machine activities. When pioneers send their territory reports, any special information is to be noted on back of i the assignment sheet, and this would ' include exceptional places where meetings can be held, as well as parking places, etc.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“I must tell you of an incident that occurred at a place where transcription meetings are held regularly, that is, the gas works at Bowden. A number of the men were having lunch, and they were discussing amongst themselves who was right. There are a parson and a Douglas credit enthusiast who also come to talk to the men. After much discussion a vote was taken, and Judge Rutherford’s lectures were by far the most popular. The majority of the men know that there is only one real hope for mankind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“At Wednesbury permission was given by the local council for a transcription series in the public parks. Three days before the first lecture, the council, without any previous warning, fixed red bills across the advertisements with the word ‘Cancelled’ printed on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“On Inquiry being made It was discovered that three clergymen, a Church of England vicar, a Roman Catholic father, and a Wesleyan minister, had gone to the town clerk and bad requested that the permission given to Jehovah’s witnesses should be rescinded. At the request of these three men, and without any inquiry being made, a letter was received withdrawing the permission already granted by the council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Action in this matter was taken, and on Saturday and Sunday, August 11 and 12, 16,000 leaflets stating very briefly the facts and Inviting the public to a protest and appeal meeting In the Hippodrome at 3 p.m. were handed to the public.

<p><span class="font3">As announced in the last </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin, </span><span class="font3">it is of the utmost importance that the September field work and transcription reports be in this office as early as possible. The wide distribution of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity-Famine </span><span class="font3">booklet will make September’s report very large, audit is hoped that every one who sends reports to the Society will have them in the mail on the 28th of September. Will each Individual worker, therefore, accept It as his personal responsibility to see to it that his complete report for the month is in the hands of his service director or sharpshooter by Friday night, September 28, and each pioneer, auxiliary, sharpshooter, and director accept It as his reappreciate what the three agents of Satan objected to. After this the chairman asked the meeting whether they were prepared to allow the clergy to think for them, and decide what was good for them. Those who objected to the action of the clergy and demanded the right of free speech, that they might learn the truth, were invited to say, ‘Aye.’ The shout that went up was conclusive. There were only live ‘No’s’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUTH AFRICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“You will he pleased to learn that the effort from June 30 to July 8 was the best midwinter effort to date. The total distribution in this and neighboring countries was 22,481 pieces of literature. Of that number, 19,581 pieces were placed in South Africa, which represents an increase of 8,680 pieces over the corresponding effort of last year. There were 72 additional workers this year, and an Increase in the hours of 834. testimonies 18,104, obtainers 11,282.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“We are receiving many enthusiastic reports from the brethren as to sponsibility to see to it that his reports to the Society are in the mail, addressed to this office, by Friday night? Do not wait for delinquent or indifferent brethren who will not cooperate in getting their reports in on time ; these can be Included in October’s report. If each one does his part there will be no difficulty and we shall have a complete report for the year’s work at an early date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Reports for The Kingdom Praise I’em on will, of course, begin with Saturday, September 29, and continue until Sunday, October 7, inclusive. Be sure to include also the work done with transcription machines and phonographs, on the report card for this special period. Also include both reports in the monthly report for October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the interest the 12-inch records are arousing. A few of these follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; ‘The records are beautiful. Recently 16 heard them and all thought Brother Rutherford could surely explain Ilie Bible. Was asked to take them to one house the second time.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ ’We took our 5-ininute records to an outdoor gathering of about 100 people on Sunday, One lady asked for your address, to send for a set of the records, and I surely gave it. to her. We can get out only on Sundays, hut we are booked for three meetings now In farm houses.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” ‘Working the 12th concession the other day we came upon a road gang. Approached the foreman and gave him the testimony and requested five minutes of the men’s time. He was quite agreeable; so we set the machine up on top of the car, got the men’s attention, and released the “Armageddon” record. As soon as the lecture concluded we placed 5 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Final War</span><span class="font3"> booklets among the 21 who listened quite attentively. Others said they had no money, and received free literature.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, Column</span><span class="font3"> 4) miles around. This was out of doors, and every one heard very well. Besides arranging for these meetings beforehand, we carry the machine with us.” “The preachers are holding meetings all over the county, and all they have to talk about is Jehovah’s witnesses and their hooks. So when we get to the homes of the people they say, ‘Those are the books,’ and, of course, the people are cold. Then I get the phonograph and records. After two or three lectures they wonder if the D.D.’s are not ‘all wet’, and In most of such calls books and booklets were taken.” “They said they would like to have the hooks but didn’t have anything to get them with, but, after hearing four lectures, took five bound books and twelve booklets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These brethren are using the phonograph which the Society is manufacturing at the factory here at Brooklyn. 'This machine is specially designed for this work, and is the best available for the purpose. Strong, compact, with a powerful spring-wound motor, and carrying space for several discs, it weighs 21 pounds with 12 records on six discs; the phonograph, with 18 recordings, $19.25. There is no arrangement for charging these to anyone, or supplying them on time payments; so remittance iu full should accompany all orders. Use the regular order blank or special letter in asking us to supply you with this equipment.</span></p>

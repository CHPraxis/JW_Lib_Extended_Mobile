<p><span class="font5">As you recall, when we made preparations for this special period, it was rather timidly suggested that we. place the quota at 75,000 Preparation. We hardly dared hope it wpuhi tie accomplished; for that number was approximately twice as many books as we placed during Ilie Praise Period November 1932. It was felt, however, that if the Lord’s people put forth the effort he would crown it with his hlessing. Therefore </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> calm and dispassionate analysis of the entire Held was made and a quota of 75,000 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation </span><span class="font5">suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To reach this 75,000 we expected to have 20.000 workers in the field. In this we overestimated, as only 16,058 workers reported, which was more titan 4,000 less than last March. Had the full 20,000 reported we should have placed about 115,000 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font5"> and over 130,000 bound books. However, they did not report, and evidently did not work, and by not doing so they lost a great privilege. But enough of what might have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lot us turn and analyze what, actually took place during this period. The 16,658 workers who reported increased the time in the service this year over last by an average of three-fourths of an hour each; and because of this they were enabled, on average, to give 17 more .testimonies. In addition to this, the conditions in the field are also changing. Last November we were able to make 1.01 placements an hour. This year we were able to make 1.32 placements an hour; an increase of 30 percent. This clearly indicates an Increased interest in the Kingdom on the part of the people. This should lie a great inspiration and stimulation to all of Jehovah’s witnesses. Tiie time has come when there is a decided awakening throughout the country on the part of the people in general; and those who love Jehovah and are desirous of having a part in the vindication of his name, recognizing this, arc anxious to take advantage of every opportunity to place the Kingdom message in the hands of those people. The accompanying table tells its own story. 91,018 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation </span><span class="font5">were placed : over 16,000 more than we dared hope would be placed nt the time preparations for the campaign were made. The total of bound-book placements for this </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">pe</span><span class="font5">riod was 104,553, which is the highest number of bound-book placements of any one period since 1929. For a bound-book period the total of testimonies also was exceptional: 1,030,970.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Undoubtedly .the large number of testimonies, tiie large number of obtainers, and the large amount of literature placed were greatly increased by the extensive use of the printed testimony, which the brethren used pretty generally throughout the country. They said very little themselves. They handed the testimony to the people and let them read it, and then briefly demonstrated the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A great deal of valuable information which we have not space to go into here can be obtained by a careful study of the table. However, the outstanding points that this entire campaign carries to the minds of God’s people are: First, that there is a marked awakening </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font5">the part of the people for the Kingdom message in bound-book form; second, that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">spirit of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah upon his </span><span class="font5">people is causing them to devote more time and energy to his serv-(Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To Jehovah’s witnesses:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The obligation laid upon you is to bear testimony to Jehovah’s name. Your deportment should be in keeping with an ambassador of the Lord. Be kind, firm and uncompromising, and always avoid either words or conduct that will necessarily provoke offense. For instance, it is reported that the following conversation occurred between a pioneer and a lady:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneer: (presents the books) The.lady replies: “No, I am not interested; I am a Christian Scientist.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneer replies: “Then you are going straight to the Devil,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such language is wholly unbecoming of anyone who represents the Lord. The Lord could not be pleased with such conduct. Frequently brethren who are rough and uncouth and try to force the people to hear them got themselves into trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you approach a house do so in a genteel way and speak with kindness. You are bringing to the people the greatest message they ever heard, and instead of telling them they are going to hell say to them that “this message will be of great help to you and I am quite sure you would like to hear it and study it ’ If they decline, then respectfully withdraw. Anyone who declines to deport himself or herself in this kind of manner is not worthy of representing the Lord. Never use harsh words, regardless of what the other person may say. Remember that you are a witness for the Lord and your business is not to get anybody into the truth or take anyone out, because that is impossible. If you bring upon yourself persecution as a result of unseemly conduct or language, then you are not suffering for righteousness’ sake. It is only those who suffer because they do right that arc suffering with Christ Jesus. These suggestions arc for the benefit of those who are having difficulties. Others do not need them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Society has prepared and mailed to everyone who has a transcription machine a packet which contains all of the advertising material that can be used to notify the people of the special series of Judge Rutherford’s lectures. As stated previously, a packet of 15 placards (3 large size for automobiles, and 12 window cards) can be had nt 25c a packet. The special announcements to be used in door-to-door witnessing are obtainable at 40c a thousand. The rubber-type, stamp<sup>1</sup> set can be had for $1.25 a set; These meetings should ‘be advertised according to the outline in the bulletin </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Your</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Work with Transcription Machines” ; </span><span class="font5">and it is believed, and in many places already proved, that large attendances will be </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font5">where </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">thorough publicity campaign </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is put </span><span class="font5">on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Beginning with January 15 all territory should be worked in sections, going over it first with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font5"> book and other publications. along with folder No. 1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Religions Intolerance.”</span><span class="font5"> Follow thereafter with the three other folders.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Considered the Auxiliary Work? Splendid Success with Transcription Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Requirements 52 Hours a Month</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Will There Be 1,000 Enrolled by Memorial Time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah commands his witnesses to tell the people that in the name of Christ Jesus, the vindicator of Jehovah niul the Savior of the world, they shall hope. Those who love Jehovah obey joyfully as pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters and company workers. Some, because of their physical condition, are unable to spend their entire time as pioneers, By reason of the national efforts to effect readjustment, parttime employment is given many persons, including some of the Lord’s people. Many of the company workers are thus engaged iu secular work or in household duties but part-time, working only a few hours each day or but a few days a week. For those who can average at least 52 hours a month in the house-to-housc work, the auxiliary arrangement is available. Can not a large number of these take advantage of the opportunity they thus have to enter the witness work as auxiliaries? It is earnestly hoped this will be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During 1933 about 5 percent of the workers in this country were auxiliaries, but these placed more than 5 percent of the literature, their total of 907,097 books and booklets representing 9 percent of I lie printed message placed. This shows the additional privileges for those who increase their time in the Held. During the past year the monthly average for auxiliary enrollment was slightly less than in 1932, and decreased a little during the year. However, practically 200,000 more pieces of literature were placed by auxiliaries in 1933 than in 1932. This shows what a splendid increase In auxiliary work may be expected for 1934 with the proper increase in the number engaging in this branch of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is a matter to be earnestly considered by the company workers and sharpshooters. We feel certain that among these there are many who can arrange their affairs to increase the time they devote to honsc-to-house service to at least 52 hours monthly, If any of the brethren are , . already spending this much time I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Continued from page 1, column 2) ice, with correspondingly better results. The reason why the Lord’s people are enabled to devote more time to the field service now than formerly is the third point, the fact that they are using the printed testimony. When a witness talks continually for three to five or six hours presenting an oral testimony, he is mentally and physically fatigued, and toward the end of the day is not so efficient In placing the literature; whereas when the printed testimony is used there is very little talking to be done, and consequently he Is conserving his energy and strength and is much fresher at the end of seven or eight hours’ witnessing than he formerly was at the end of five or six. In fact, the brethren throughout the country write us saying that they believe that this is a clear Indication of the I,ord’s direction in this matter, as it enables them to put in more than the required number of hours, which formerly was almost impossible, due to physical and mental exhaustion. Therefore the Society strongly recommends that the brethren use the printed testimony regularly. It not only has the effect of conserving the strength and energy of the worker, but also results in n uniform presentation everywhere and increases I </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he efficiency of the Lord's people </span><span class="font5">in the field as company workers, let them apply for auxiliary appointment, so that all work will be properly classified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An auxiliary who averaged 54 hours a month for the past year has written : “I started thinking how I could arrange my work so that I could get in the required time and still take care of the work on the farm. That was three years ago last November, 1 am still in -the auxiliary work, and with the Lord’s help I expect to continue. There arc months when 1 cannot get in the required time, through sickness or otherwise, but I report each month stating the reason why, as the Society requires, and the next month I try to make it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ “Paul tells us to “ho not slothful in business”. If we put in only three or four hours each week when we could put in, by careful planning, enough time to be on the auxiliary list, we are being slothful in the Lord’s business.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another auxiliary writes: “We put In a full day, us much as ten hours in summer; for when we have taken the time to get ready to go, why not put in full time? Even in these short winter days, we get in six and seven hours. Do we get tired? I’ll say we do; but we get tired chopping wood, too. Do wc quit and go home when it rains? No, we just keep on going. We carry an umbrella and overshoes for such days. Oue thing is certain: If you do not make up your mind to put in that time, you will not do it. Take advantage of every moment you cau spare to get into the service and you will soon have your fifty-two hours each month, Ihe required time for auxiliaries.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work thus far during the fiscal year 1934 and that before us fills the hearts of the remnant with gratitude to Jehovah, joy in ids service, and a determination to Increase this service. Why not arrange to serve as an auxiliary, and then write for complete information and a questionnaire for making your application? Spring will soon be here, good weather, and a special period, “Thanksgiving Testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses”; aud wouldn’t that be a fine time to start?</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font5">in placing the Kingdom message in the hands of the people. It lakes the Lord’s work entirely out of the category of salesmanship, removes the personality clement, and leaves simply the appeal (hat the Kingdom and the Kingdom message has as outlined in the testimony card. This must of necessity be the thing that appeals to the honest-hearted. To simply have someone take literature because of another’s exerting personal influence over him is of practically no value. When they take the literature because they want to know about the Lord’s kingdom and desire to be in harmony with it, the Lord’s blessing goes with that, and the witness and recipients are both blessed.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Bulletin Enclosures</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are being sent along with this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font5"> for each worker, one court procedure letter, one new testimony card which gives a genei’al testimony for all the books, and, in a few days, a new testimony booklet containing the same testimony in sixteen languages. Each pioneer, auxiliary, and sharpshooter will receive </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">new cost list, and each company will receive three cost lists. All previous cost lists should be destroyed, so that you have only ihe latest one </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">consult when ordering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports Should Be Sent in Regularly</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Goal 100,000 Attendance Each Month</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not very long ago transcription machines were unknown as a means of giving the Kingdom witness, and now they are a necessary part of the service equipment of Jehovah’s witnesses. There is no question as to what is Jehovah’s will in the use of these machines, as he has so abundantly blessed the efforts of his people in their transcription work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Additional proof of the fact that the transcription work is very successful is found hi the reports which are sent to this office by the transcription leaders. Let us look at the report of the pioneer and auxiliary activity wil.li the machines for the first month of this fiscal year, the month of October. Reports were received from brethren using 112 machines, 5 by auxiliaries, the rest used by pioneers. This work was carried on in 34 states in f his country, in the Bahamas, and in Costa Rica. Texas led the states in the number of machines used by pioneers during October, 12 reporting from there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the entire period of the fiscal year of 1933 in which transcription machines were used, the pioneers aud auxiliaries reported </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">total attendance of 105,257. Compare with this the attendance for one month, October—44,074. The average attendance per meeting increased from 48 for the preceding year to 55 for October. 817 meetings were held, and a total of 1,123 lectures were run. During the month of October placements made at transcription meetings wore reported by pioneers and auxiliaries for (tie first time, 306 books and 1,871 booklets being left with those attending the lectures. These interesting figures are an excellent start in the transcription work for the new year. A tremendous witness by this means is anticipated during Ihe coming transcription campaign immediately following the work with the PROTEST AND PETITION, and all will wish to join therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wc wish to take this opportunity to stress the importance of regular</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Following is a reprint of the special testimony prepared by Brother Rutherford for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People</span><span class="font5"> booklet. This is arranged so that it can be cut out and placed in a celluloid folder and used Indefinitely. We are unable to supply this testimony curd for the Englishspeaking brethren throughout the country, due to the tremendous transcription reports by all pioneers, auxiliaries, company workers and sharpshooters with machines. We are glad that most of the brethren who have the machines arc now making these reports; but there are still a few whoso work is not included in the total figures because they do not report. We hope that from now on everyone will send in his I i-anseriptiou report promptly. The company reports for October were not complete, and llierefore could not be included in the above.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">With Ihe outline set out for the year's work with transcription machines we hope to soon reach a monthly attendance of 100,000 people. We should go well over that, but. just now it is a good goal to aim at.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Dividing the People” Testimony Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 20-28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order Hint a complete report may he promptly made out for “Dividing the People” Testimony period of January 20-28, we urge each service director, sharpshooter, pioneer and auxiliary to make a special effort to promptly mail to us a report card covering the activities of this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Additionally, we request you to promptly send in a complete report for the ENTIRE mouth of JANL'ARY. This January report is to show all the work done from January 1 to 3.1. inclusive. Please be sure to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Celluloid Cases</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each worker should get a celluloid case in which to properly keep and preserve the testimony card. This is very necessary, for otherwise the card will quickly become soiled. The Society has printed but a limited quantify of these cards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As later testimonies are announced, these can be neatly typewritten or printed on a card, and with a good celluloid case such cards can be made to last indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">amount of work now going through the factory, but the one appearing in the. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font5"> can be used just as effectively by cutting (tout aud placing it.in a folder as it is or pasting it on ft sheet of white cardboard and then placing it: in the folder, or using it without a folder, as the case may be, It is strongly recommended that each worker get one of the celluloid envelopes for his testimony, as tills is very convenient, keeps the testimony neat and clean, aud is generally much better than an ordinary card would be.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font5"> you read, ■■■Faithful ones of the remnant who are wise in heavenly wisdom receive their assignment of territory ns Jehovah's witnesses and walk up and down in tiie earth delivering his testimony.” On the faithful ones in the United States rests the responsibility of walking up and down in a very large section of the earth. What about the isolated territory in tills country that is not now assigned? How much of the country can we cover this year? The work of dividing the people as outlined for the campaign for 11)34, including the transcription machine activities, emphasizes the importance of covering </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To reach all of this isolated pioneer territory not held by companies, two things are necessary ; (1) Those who are now in the isolated pioneer field will try to cover a little more ground than they did last year, ami (2) more brethren will take up the pioneer work in such territory. Many of the pioneers are now cooperating with companies in thickly settled sections in order to go right ahead with the witness work during bad weather. It is very good that this arrangement is possible. The Society is glad to grant such assignments, and the companies rejoice in cooperating with the pioneers in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">eoBipuny</span><span class="font5"> territory. Now, however, is the time for all who can do so to plan on what arrangements they can make to go to Isolated sections for their work during Ute coming spring, summer and fall. Also, to increase the scope of the pioneer work so that just as much of the country as possible will be covered this year, we earnestly hope that more brethren will enroll as pioneers. Consider what you can do, and write to the pioneer department</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Groups of pioneers are finding that the larger their party is, the more opportunities they will have for using the transcription machine. One has written, “We find that there are so many neighborhoods in which we would like to give the lectures that we don’t have time to get to.” It is evident that a large group of pioneers should be able to keep more than one machine busy, and, of course, the same is true of company organizations. Undoubtedly in the near future the companies who do not now have transcription equipment will arrange to get the machines, and those who now have but one or two will find it necessary to add to their transcription equipment. More and more isolated pioneers will procure the machines, and large groups of pioneers who are now using one will find it necessary to have two or more to meet the demands for the lectures. In order that the people in isolated territory not reached by any company may have an opportunity to got in touch with the transcription work, it is necessary that the pioneers go to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The great distance over which Brother Rutherford's voice carries has lead to many Interesting experiences. A Kansas pioneer writes: “I left the machine in a car. Mr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■-----, who lived a mile away, sat</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">on his porch and heard the lecture. When it was over lie was well pleased with it and came to see what deep-voiced man was doing the talking. He was Interested in the talk, and would not listen to anything pertaining to religion or the Bible before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From Michigan: “Wc arc finding that state parks afford n very good place lo give the lectures, and i air-mission has never been refused thus far. In one of the meetings there were two clergymen, and these took it so hard that they went around to all the audience and endeavored to alleviate the ‘torment' by shaking hands and conversing with them. When the lecture was over several said, ‘Give us some more’; so wc put on another lecture for them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another instance whore the machine was taken to a large group of people and used without a great expense is shown in Illis: &quot;PerImps the greatest joy in giving these lectures so far has been at the reforestation eamps. In one instance we left 12 volumes and several booklets and started a study. Some of the boys were homesick and they thanked us many times for coming out and giving the message, which was a great comfort to them. At one camp we arranged for a lecture in the late evening, and on instructions from the commanding officer a great camp tire was made and about 200 of the boys sat around it on the banks of a beautiful little lake. Brother Ru1h erford's voice rang out with great clearness and volume ail over the camp.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An unusual and very successful use of the transcription machine was made during an old settlers’ reunion In Oklahoma. The pioneer working that territory not only made arrangements to use rhe machine during the celebration, hut also bad an announcement included on the handbill which advertised the afi’air and gave the program for the three days during which this reunion was held. This program consisted of bronco busting, stecr and wild buffalo riding and roping; all the events of a western rodeo and reunion. The pioneer writes: &quot;Wc used the machine twice to a thousand listeners. As a result of so many hearing tins we are invited to more country schoolhouses than we can possibly make, and also requests for transcription meetings are coming to us from outside of our territory.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Should Be Reported on Your Report Cards?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some questions have come to the office asking liow lo report lime spent in the portable transcription machine activity. This is a privilege of service, and should be considered as such. The lime spent, in this service, however, should not be reported on the monthly report card of the service director, because the service report of Ihe director should show the number of workers and the hours these workers spent in door-to-door witnessing. If hours other than those, spent in door-to-door witnessing were included in this report il would throw off nil percentages and averages that the office keeps iu its records, A monthly report is sent in for the transcription work, and the information therein is all that is necessary, and the office knows that it requires time to do the work Hint is marked thereon. Whatever work is done is done ns unto the laird. Each work has its special duties to perform, and separate reports are made mil, and the activity of one should not conflict with the other. ’Pile work with transcription machines will lie done mostly in the evenings, and the brethren working on these programs should not report their lime as field work, any more than a brother who lias been up pointed to lead a study meeting. Both, however, arc in the service of the Lord and doing their duty; but what the Society desires'to have is Ihe amount of time spent In door-fo-door wit nesting, because it is on this basis that certain information is obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibles</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has on hand a small stock of low-priced Bibles, the dimensions of which are 3?” x 5i&quot; X Is&quot;. These are to be placed with the public at 25 cents each. As long as they hist we will supply them to pioneers at 15c each, and to auxiliaries and company workers at 20c each. These should be placed in conjunction with oilier books and booklets whenever IMissible, and we hope it will Lie an aid to the brethren in placing literature. This Bible is trimmed in red and neatly hound with an imitation black leather cover, and should be attractive to the people because of its low price. It’ll co ordering, order Bible No. 20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SHALL THE NATIONS HOPE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New Booklet Will Be Great'Aid</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With perilous times befalling the people of the United States, distress and famine wreaking havoc, it is most opportune for the Lord to provide his people with a special message in the form of a 32-pnge booklet,, “WHY PRAY FOR PROSPERITY? IF2TT FAMINE THREATENED? THE TRUE ANSWER. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">READ.&quot;</span><span class="font3"> That’s tile front cover. On the second page there is a short, testimony which really puts the question squarely before the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The nation is threatened with famine. Who is to blame? What shall we do? Clergy and ‘distinguished men’ say, Tray for prosperity.' What will you do? The contents of this booklet will help you to decide.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then there follows a heart-cheering and conit'orling message which Brother Rutherford delivered with such force and conviction, which is so manifest in Jehovah’s witnesses. The brethren should read tills immediately, and they will be enthused and thrilled, and they will burn with the zeal of the Lord.. Now is the lime to place it in the hands of the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ORGANIZATION METHODS OUTLINED FOR COMPANIES</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Al! Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Should Acquaint Themselves with These</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Unity in Action Essential Amongst Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Companies Eligible for Service Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To properly maintain a “company service arrangement”, there should be, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">at the very least,</span><span class="font3"> seven witnesses in the field service working an average of seventy hours a month. Companies unable to meet this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">minimum requirement</span><span class="font3"> should organize under the “sharpshooter arrangement”. The sharpshooter arrangement has the same status as tliril: of a “company”, except that the duty and responsibility of directing the witness work is placed upon one individual, and not upon a service committee, which service committee should, at the very least, consist of Ihree members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Two Farts of a Company Service Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The two parts are the witnesses and the service committee cooperat-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The brethren will appreciate that, not all of these booklets can be in the hands of the companies and pioneers before August 25, because it takes considerable lime lo print three million and ship Uiern. However, we will ship as many of these booklets as we possibly can before August 25. Wc will continue lo ship, and as you receive consignments after the 25th begin working immediately. The &quot;west coast consignments are being shipped by boat, and it takes three weeks to get there, and they will not be received until about the middle of September. However, as soon as you receive those, push hard and vigorously with (lie campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Consignments will be made to companies, and tiie directors will receive sufficient quantities for I he pioneers and auxiliaries in that territory. For those isolated pioneers mid auxiliaries shipments will be made direct. You will receive them in due time; therefore do not order or write about them until after you have received your first allotment. If more are needed, then order.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">committee. The service committee (which should consist of not more than ten members) is to be chosen from the mature brethren of the company who are anointed and in full sympathy with and actively engage in the field service, not Jona-dabs. The service committee is to fully and harmoniously cooperate with the service director in organizing and carrying forward the witness activities under the direction of the Society. The service director may or may not be a member of the service committee,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Director</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The director is appointed by (he Society and serves as its representative to direct the field activity of the company. His responsibility to the Society is that of carrying out the Inst ructions he receives from the oilice from time to time through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Bulletins,</span><span class="font3"> letters, etc.; and his responsibility to the</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3,000,000 Now Being Printed</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Regarding the special campaign August 25 to September 29, wc quote from Brother Rutherford’s letter, which strikes the very keynote of our relationship to this period:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The people are In distress aud perplexity. Be diligent to got this booklet into their hands as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is our authority lo act; our marching orders, as it were. Some degree of the importance of this message may be seen from the following facts: Both messages con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Rcports of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Activities</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brethren now having transcription machines should include their phonograph meeting results along with tire transcription results on the monthly TTM cards supplied them. Ollier brethren (except pioneers having pink card) are requested to report their monthly phonograph activities on a sheet of paper, giving the following information: Number of machines used; number of lectures run; number of meetings held; total attendance at these meetings, and the number of books and booklets placed thereat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">company is that of directing its field service activities in the territory assigned to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Stockkeeper</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The stockkccper will have charge oi all the supplies of literature furnished by 1 he Society for the witness work. It is the duty of the stockkeeper to keep full and accurate account of the stock committed to his care. AU supplies for the witness work will be obtained from the stockkccper. The best course to follow is for the workers to contribute immediately for all books obtained from the stockkccper. Credit may be extended to such workers as cannot immediately contribute for the books, with the understanding that it is the duty of the service treasurer to collect for them as they are placed, and, in case the worker becomes inactive, to notify tho stockkeeper, who will request the return of the books that have not been placed. The stoekkeepcr should turn over to the service treasurer all the contributions received for books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The stockkeeper will make out all </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Contimied on page S, column 1) </span><span class="font3">talncd in the booklet, “Famine” and “Fraying for Prosperity”, have been delivered by Brother Rutherford over eastern radio networks. The echo of the hist talk had hardly died out before Brother Rutherford was making arrangements for this campaign. It was decided that the first printing should be three million copies and as many more afterwards as may be required. A double shift was immediately put to work. The factory is now operating day and night to get this message Into your hands immediately, so that all company workers, pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters, Jonadabs, in fact, everybody who loves the Lord, might get iu line to carry this message to the people and might commence making preparations immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This letter not only carries to you tiie announcement of the campaign, but also carefully outlines therein all details: manner of consigning the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity-Faiuine</span><span class="font3"> booklet, the combination to be offered, how contributions are to he received mid disposed of, aud the period of time the campaign will cover. Every detail Is taken care of. Therefore let all those who love the Lord unite in pushing this campaign vigorously while the clergy, and “the distinguished men” of the nation hold their “union prayer meeLin’ ”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The testimony to be used during this campaign will be found on the cover of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity-Famine</span><span class="font3"> booklet. First show the people the questions on the outside of the cover. Then turn to the inside of the cover and let them read the short testimony printed therein. After they have read the testimony, then tell them (hat this booklet, with the two others, you are leaving with those who contribute ten cents. If they cannot afford that contribution, then offer the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity-Famine</span><span class="font3"> booklet as outlined in the teller by Brother Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Rut forth every effort to complete the campaign by September 29; especially put forth an extraordinary effort during September 7, S and 9, which is the special period set aside for the “union prayer nieetin’ ” of these “distinguished men”. Even with ail the rush of working day and night, the factory will be closed alt day Saturday September 1 and 8 so that the Bethel family can spend four full days in the distribution of this booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Be sure to keep a record of all literature placed and report It to the director so that it may bo included in the reports for August aud September. What n privilege Jehovah has granted his people in ttie earth at this time! Let us all carry on in unity to the glory of his name. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 8} </span><span class="font3">orders for literature as may be required, using the regular </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">company order ilank.</span><span class="font3"> printed specially for this purpose, and hand the order to the director for his approval. The director will send in the order to the Society. If possible, always place orders for at least one hundred pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature Is Not to Be Stamped</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Books and booklets are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font3"> to be stamped with the name and address of the company, nor with any other information. Neither should any circular or card he inserted unless such insertion has been approved by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Treasurer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The service treasurer will have charge of all contributions received from the distribution of the literature shipped to the company by the Society. The service treasurer, as the representative of the company, will remit for all literature placed during the month, turning the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">money order,</span><span class="font3"> made out to Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, over to the director to forward to tire Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Book Account</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the privilege, and to the convenience, of the company to avail Itself of the Society’s credit arrangement for campaign literature. Each company whose account is In good condition may order as much literature on account us may be required, making remittance therefor as placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An account is considered to be in good condition when the company remits once each month or once within every three months for the literature disposed of within that period of time; in poor condition when the company falls .to remit at least once within three months or fails to remit for the value of Um literature placed and due the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A failure to remit at least once within three months or failure to remit for literature placed and due the Society automatically places the company on the suspended credit list. No further credit will be allowed Such company until proper remittance Is made. Each company should therefore endeavor to follow the rule of remitting once a month for the literature placed ; small companies, at the very least once in three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each month a statement of the company account is forwarded to the company, in care of the director. It is the special duty and responsibility of the service committee to examine this statement of the condition of the company account. Furthermore, the service committee shall give to the company an account of the amount that has been remitted to the Society during the month, the cost value of the literature still in stock, and the amount of money on hand. The last two items should be sufficient to balance the amount due the Society,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription Leader</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In companies a transcription leader should be appointed to conduct the PTM work in cooperation with the field service organization. In large companies an assistant or even a PTM committee may be appointed to serve along with the transcription leader; all under the supervision of the service director and cooperating with the field service organization. The duties of a transcription leader (or committee) are: Obtaining and searching out locations for meetings ; seeing that the meetings a re properly advertised and conducted, and proper reports thereof made to the service director, as well as arranging study meetings after the series is given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Activities</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The company should have and use as many phonographs as it can possibly handle to advantage. A phonograph should be considered as a part of the service equipment of each automobile. This witness work must be conducted In an orderly-way, and, therefore, the director is to aid and instruct all the workers in tho use of this method of witnessing according to the Society’s policy. All members of the company, including the Jonadabs, should avail themselves of this splendid opportunity of witnessing to the people in their own homes. Appropriate worker’s slips are provided by the Society for the workers to properly record all their witness activities, including the work with the phonographs. These slips are to be used by all the workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Correspondence and Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the duty of the director to bring to the attention of the company all instructions and communications from the Society nt the first possible opportunity, so that Hie company may know the requirements of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All field service, PTM, and phonograph correspondence with the Society is to be done by and through the director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Promptly each month the director is to see that a report of the company witness activities is sent to the Society, on the regular monthly report card. Therefore workers tire to make prompt and accurate reports of their activities to the director, using the regular daily worker's report slips supplied for this very purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Points</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the event that the director should be unable, neglect, fail or refuse to carry out the instructions of the Society, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">company</span><span class="font3"> should bring the matter </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font3"> the attention of the Society as soon as possible'. II. is hoped that this action will not be necessary, but the witness work in any company should not be hampered by inattention of the director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Books are shipped to the company on consignment and charged to their account at company rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every member of the company engaging In .the service an average of three hours a week, and so reporting to the local service director, shall be entitled to receive books at the rate at which the Society bills the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In determining who shall receive this rate, the matter shall be left between the worker and the Lord. If the worker comes to the service</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">ters, gather up all the reports and department and requests books at compile a monthly report of the the company rate it is to be accepted j group for this office, issue territory, that that one is pulling in the three | and be responsible for the account, tiours a week necessary to obtain : The others will turn over to that books at that rate. If anyone mis- one prompt reports of their activity represents the facts for the purpose i each mouth and also remit to him of getting the books at company I for the literature they have obtained, rates without complying with the j In this way an orderly arrangement lime requirements, he is answerable can be established to function to the to the Lord, and not to anyone else, praise of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Ths Sharpshooter Service Arrangement</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the witnesses of Jehovah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">located, in isolated territory</span><span class="font3"> (territory not served by a company) who arc unable to put In sufficient time in the service as auxiliaries or pioneers, Ilie Society provides and recommends the sharpshooter service arrangement. This arrangement, composed of either one. individual or small group of two or more brethren under one sharpshooter, requires an average of at least eight hours a month in the house-to-hduse field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In eases of individual brethren the individual (either a brother or a sister) may serve as sharpshooter, provided that the monthly average of at least eight hours a month can be maintained. In cases of small groups of two or more brethren whose activities and number do not require a service committee of at least three members to supervise their field activilles, the brethren can and should organize under the sharpshooter arrangement, provided they can collectively maintain the average of at least eight hours a month. Under this arrangement one member of the group should be chosen to serve as sharpshooter, with the other brethren witnesswig in conjunction with the sharpshooter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The sharpshooter, as the representative of the group, will be assigned suitable territory. Bulletins and all service mail will be sent direct to the sharpshooter. An account will be opened in the name of the sha.rpshooter, on which may be ordered, on credit at the same rates given companies, such literature as may bo necessary to carry on the witness work effectively. Remittances are to be made regularly on the account for the literature received on credit as the literature is placed. The sharpshooter is also required to submit a service report each month of the field activities of the sharpshooter arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers coming in contact with Jehovah’s witnesses in isolated territory should encourage such to make application to this office for this branch of the service, it' such brethren can meet the minimum time requirement of an average of eight hours a month. Of course, only one sharpshooter is appointed for any one town or territory, and, therefore, brethren located in sharpshooter territory should arrange to carry on their field witness activities in conjunction with and under the local sharpshooter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Jonadabs in Isolated Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers and others will find .Tona-dabs in isolated territory not held by any company or sharpshooter. Encourage them to personally make application to this office for field service, it they are at the time taking an active share in the witness work and wish to continue to do so umler Ihe direction of this office. Where there are groups of two or more they should be gathered together and the most capable and active one among them should be appointed to write to the Society concerning their part in the witness work. The Society wifi be pleased to aid such by supplying sufficient literature, territory and general field instructions to the one chosen to represent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ihe group.</span><span class="font3"> The one chosen will be the one to correspond with the Society regarding service mat</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">New Monthly Report Cards</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A supply of these new cards, combining field service, PTM, and phonograph activities, is being sent to each service director, sharpshooter, pioneer, and auxiliary. Everyone Is to begin using these new cards, starting with the first report of the fiscal year of 1935, namely, The Kingdom Praise Period of September 29-October 7. Then and thereafter these new cards are to he used, and no longer are you to use the former cards. Your cooperation in Ibis respect will be much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">New Worker's Slips</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new worker’s slips contain the same data as shown on the monthly report cards, thus enabling the company workers to give tho service director all the information</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>“Hee Now” Record</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">We have received n number of letters from different brethren regarding the “Flee Now” record, claiming that it Is unsatisfactory. The reason for the unsatisfactory reproduction in this particular record is that there is too much power turned on. If the volume is reduced to a point where the clear reproduction of Brother Rutherford’s voice is heard it will be effective enough to reach any ordinary audience. If necessary, invite the audience to come closer, so all can hear it. When it is turned on high the under-surface noises are such that they drown out the voice and make the record mushy. Care should be taken, therefore, when “Flee Now” is used, to see that the volume is not turned on too high,</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>“Famine” Record</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">Regarding the “Famine” record: This has not been shipped to the different companies yet, and may not be shipped for a considerable time. If you come to the point where “Famine” Is called for in your series and yon have not received your record, make arrangements to have a study of the “Famine” talk from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity-Famine</span><span class="font3"> booklet instead of the record, and then you can take up the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People </span><span class="font3">study after that is finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The placements of the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperil-y-Famwe</span><span class="font3"> are to be COUNTED and REPORTED along with the other booklets placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your August report will show all your activities during that month, while your September report will show the activities from September I to and including Friday September 28. Remember, Saturday and Sunday September 29 and 30 are the first two days of The Kingdom Praise Period, and therefore the activities of these Iwo days will be included in your Kingdom Braise Period report. Your report for the month of October is to include all the activities from Saturday September 29 to and including October 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">he needs in order io properly make out his reports to the Society. A limited consignment of these slips is being forwarded to each of the companies. Worker’s slips are not being consigned to the sharpshooters. If they wish these for the. workers witnessing with them, they should order whatever quantity they require. There is no charge for these slips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Complete Addressee</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each service director, sharpshooter, pioneer, auxiliary, or any other of l he brethren writing to the Society, is requested to put his COMPLETE name and address on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">each </span><span class="font3">letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A surprisingly large amount of time is lost through having to look up addresses, and this can be obviated if EACH ONE will write his complete name and address on every letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Changes in Address</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The service department of this office should be immediately advised of all changes in the address of service directors and sharpshooters. A SEPARATE letter concerning changes in address should be addressed to this department.. A notification ONLY to The Watch Tower or The Golden Age does not necessarily reach the service department; and therefore service mail sent to the directors and sharpshooters is frequently delayed on this account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers and auxiliaries should promptly notify the pioneer department of changes in their address, on regular “Change of Address” slip.</span></p>

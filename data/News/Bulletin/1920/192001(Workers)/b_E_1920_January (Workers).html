By the Lord’s Word opposition will not continue long. Those associated with the Lamb in the skirmishes of the war with the beast, and continuing throughout, are “called and chosen and faithful.” The final test is Faithfulness. Our sentiments as workers are in the Year’s Text—“The Lord is my Strength and Song”. The song of his gracious plans to mankind engages his people. He affords strength for the service. And the strength and the song bring responsibility to declare the message.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Message the People Want</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age Is the message the people want. It is hut for them to find out what it contains. A worker writes us from 1’eunsyh ania: “A prominent dobtor of this city, who is also a member of a club, told me yesterday that he took a copy of The Golden Age to the club one evening, and that himself and several other members spent the evening in discussing its various features; and lr the end they decided that The Golden Age was something new and different from anything they had seen before, and that it was worthy of support.” It is by just such discussions and talking over the message contained in The Golden Age that the canvass has accomplished. People for the most part do not act impulsively, nor on the spur of the moment, but after they have had the time to consider, and compare what was offered with what they have and with that they can obtain; then they have some basis upon which to decide.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>A Professor—A Manufacturer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">A colporteur writes: “One man who is a college professor subscribed to The Golden Age, saying: “It is just what I have been looking for’. Another, a manufacturer, said, ‘It contains good, sound reading—just what I want. So many other magazines are one-half advertisements and so high priced, and nothing practical to read.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Best I Ever Saw</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A brother from Ohio writes: “One brother gave a sample copy to a man who he thought would like it. After the man examined It he said it was a very good magazine, but like all the I. B. S. A. literature, it had a lot of Bible quotations in it; so he gave it to a friend of his, an oil worker, who read it and said, ‘It is the best magazine I ever saw,’ and wanted to subscribe.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The Jews Interested</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">“One sister met a Jew, the proprietor of a department store, who is interested in the Zionist movement and is very much discouraged. He said he was afraid the whole race would be exterminated. She gave him the comforting message of the present time to the Jews, in which he became much interested, and invited her to come again.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the Books Eight Years</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">“Already one sister came to a house where the lady had had the books, Studies in the Scbiptubes, eight years. She says no one could get her to believe anything else, and has Been trying to find some one that believed as she did.” (This comes from a town In which there is a class of fourteen.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Interest in a Dead City</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Calling on one lady, who seemed to be a consecrated woman, she said; ‘Our minister of the Congregational church said the people are so unresponsive to his efforts, and if they didn’t soon respond he would have to give up his pastorate and work in the slums, where • they would respond.’ This city is known by salesmen, as well as others, to be dead, so to speak. Sunday we had advertised a good deal for a meeting in the theater, and it was the biggest success we have had along this line. Thirty-nine names were handed in. We are very much encouraged, and believe The Golden Age work and lectures will work wonderfully together.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">C</span><span class="font4">ANVASSING and recanvassing a locality leaves its indent upon the minds of those canvassed, and this impression deepens with each additional call. The people reason like this: “If that man (or woman) is giving his time to canvassing for that magazine, there must be something in it; either personal gain, or the magazine contains a message worth looking over.” Many canvassers make an initial call and do not call again ; but not so with The Golden Age worker: refusal of the subscription is merely the invitation for another call. The work is so great as to call for even the little time and effort that each can give. It should stimulate all to do with might what the hands find to do, working while it is yet called day. Endeavor to leave in the minds of the people these points: The present order of things has ended; the new order is the setting up of the Lord’s Kingdom; the I. B. S. A. alone tells of the new order; that the preachers are shirking their responsibility, and instead of meeting the issue bring up subterfuges to perpetuate their outworn doctrine; movements are on foot by church organizations to demonstrate to the people that the past war was nothing more than one of the spasmodic upheavals of history, and are putting themselves oh record as the scoffers, of whom the Apostle Peter spoke.

The present canvassing ought to leave such an impression that any further outraging of the opinions of the people, such as the banning of literature, may not be taken calmly and uncomplainingly, but may have the same effect in the opinion of the people as the acts of the steel magnates, coal mine operators, and profiteers had. The message should be gotten to as many as possible. It is not likely that the majority will respond at the first canvass with a subscription to The Golden Age ;■ but the present stress of times is but “the beginning of sorrows”; and as the trouble and distress Incident thereto are more keenly felt, then will follow the collapse of Babylon. With the collapse, the people will insist on hearing the Lord’s message. Now is the opportunity to impress on their minds that the I. B. S. A. promulgates the truth, and was for that very reason singled out as the one religious organization to reap persecution during the World War.</span></p>

Would you be so kind as to inform me who’ it was who has seen fit to please me in this way, for I wish to thank him. I would certainly have wanted to subscribe on my own account had not some one else done it for me, but the copy I have is the first knowledge I had had of the existence of your very out-of-the-ordinary publication. I am only an ordinary American workingman, without technical training of any kind, and earning ordinary wages, but I think I know a fine thing when I see it, and this is one of them. I hardly know how to describe your publication, but to me it is solid meat all through and has surely touched the right spot in my heart.

<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>SOME MORE POINTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">When collecting samples, if no subscriptions are forthcoming, endeavor to find out the objection the people have to the magazine; also as to whether they read it or not. If they have not read it, offer to leave it with them free, and assure them that you will not bother them by calling a few days later if they will promise that, finding anything of interest, they will forward the subscription to you by mail. Then, two or three weeks later, you could call upon them again in event you did not receive the subscription.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">When sending in orders for supplies we wish the friends would not mix their orders; and by this we mean that when writing The Golden Age you should not order books and supplies furnished by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. Orders for such should be kept separate; and all Golden Age subscriptions should be kept separate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regarding what is said on the front page about reports, the following excerpts from two letters, received from Directors, were written instead of sending a report. '“The workers failed to hand in their reports, although I have urged them to do so and tried to make them realize the necessity for their doing so in order that I may be able to fib out the report card properly.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">N.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“And then shall the end come”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Millions now living will never die” is “this ' gospel of the kingdom” mentioned in Matthew 24:14. This means, then, that it is the witness to be given before the end. The Lord thus identifies for us the last witness that the church in the flesh will give; and if his statement is linked with that of the Apostle Peter in 2 Peter 3:12, this fact is brought forth emphatically. There the Apostle says: “Expecting and hastening the presence of the day of , God”. In other words, the thought is that those who are aware of the presence of the Lord will engage in giving the last witness, which shall bring the end, and that in so doing they will hasten the presence of the day of God. From the emphasis that our Lord laid upon the words in the text </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">this </span><span class="font3">gospel, we perceive that it is the message to be left by the bride class as a heritage of comfort, hope and cheer to</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“Good morning ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Do you know that millions now living will never die?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I mean just what I say—that millions now living are never going to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ ‘The Finished Mystery’, the posthumous work of Pastor Russell, tells why there are millions now living who will never die; and if you can keep alive until 1925 you have excellent chances of being one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Since 1881 everybody ridiculed Pastor Russell and the International Bible Students Association's message that the Bible prophesied a world war in 1914; but the war came on time, and now the message of his final work, ‘millions now living will never die’, is being regarded seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“It is an absolute fact, stated in every book of the Bible, foretold by every prophet of the Bible. I believe you will agree that this subject is well worth a few evenings’ time for investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ ‘The Finished Mystery’ can be had for $1.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“In order that those living may be aware of the actual existence of this period, The Golden Age, a bi-weekly magazine, deals with current events that mark the institution of the Golden Age—the age when death will cease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“A year’s subscription is $2.00, or both book and magazine can be had for $2.75.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ ‘The Finished Mystery’ tells why millions now living will never die, and The Gowen Age will reveal cheer and comfort behind the dark and threatening clouds— both for two-seventy-five”(don’t say dollars).</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">truth people are that everyone therein will be repeating it, knowing of it, wondering about it, investigating it, and believing it. To attain this result every accessible means of publicity should be used. Additionally, the canvass for “The Finished Mystery” will be changed to announce this message and to tell that “The Finished Mystery” tells why “millions now living will never die”.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Now—Never</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">To approach people at their home and ask them point - blankly whether they know that millions now living will never die will cause. them to stare at you in amazement and say, ‘Why, what do you mean?’ Then reply that you mean exactly what you say. The next question in their minds is: ‘How do you know it?’ Then point out that “The Finished Mystery” tells this. As you bring to light thf date, 1925 they may become skeptical and say: ‘O yes,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Seventh Volume then comes to the front again peculiarly as the point of the sword. The . slogan, “millions now living will never die”, should be so prominent in each city where the there are always dates being brought by Bible prophets and readers; but how many of them have-come true?’ Then remind them that everybody ridiculed the 1914 date, but that the predicted war came to pass and that the same people who heralded forth that message are heralding forth the message that “millions now living will never die” ; and that surely if their</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">understanding of divine prophecies was correct jn 1914, their present message should be regarded seriously. Declare your absolute confidence in the message, that you believe it to be a fact, or you wouldn’t be out telling about it. Bring them to the point of admitting that they are interested, and then ask them point - blankly again whether they do not think it is worth a few evenings’ time to read the book and find out something about the matter. Then mention the price and point out that further reading is provided so that they may watch the inauguration of the Golden Age through' a biweekly magazine of that name. They will then discern something more in the present troubles than merely ominous signs of gloom and despondency. They will see that there is something beyond this terrible time of trouble,, that the Lord told what it isand that The Golden Age magazine will bring this to their attention for their encouragement.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Proposals tor Renewals</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Director will bring to your attention subscriptions as they are expiring. Special attention should be given to obtaining a year’s renewal from subscribers now on the list. Heretofore it has been recommended that no premium be given with a renewal subscription, and we believe this is the method that should be used when first approaching one whose subscription is expiring. Merely speak to them on the subject of renewing for $2.00 per year. If they do not care to renew, then as a first inducement offer a copy of “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” as a premium. If this does not obtain the renewal subscription, then make a second offer of two booklets—“Millions Now Living Will Never Die” and “Talking With the Dead” for $2.25; and if a third offer is necessary, then “The Finished Mystery” and “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” for $2.85. If these offers are unavailing then we believe that further efforts should not be put forth and that the subscriber chould be permitted to drop from jhe list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” booklet should be left as a premium only when a promise is given to read it. Such copies as are sold should be followed up with a canvass for “The Finished Mystery”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In soliciting renewals “millions now living will never die” should be the theme of the canvass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The commission on renewal subscriptions will be the same as on new subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In making the house-to-house canvass following up the distribution the- Director will see that you have up-to-date sample copies of The Golden Age to canvass with.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Every person in the truth has the opportunity of heralding forth the glad tidings and comforting message ■—■ “millions now living will never die”. The message is not limited to brethren who can do public speaking, but is one that the sisters and those brethren who are not qualified to do public speaking—yea, all cun go forward and tell. It is a message that will be advertised during this coming winter in every city of any size for at least four weeks of public</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Message Not Canvas The Witness</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The combination offer, then, that' is suggested is the Seventh Volume and The Golden Age for $2.75. The “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” booklet we recommend be used in the following manner: If, after you have canvassed for “The Finished Mystery” and The Golden Age, the people for some reason or other say that they cannot take either publication, then bring to their attention the booklet, “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”. Offer to sell them a copy of this booklet for 25 cents, provided they promise to read it. Ten days after having delivered the booklet, call again upon the parties and ascertain whether they have read it. If they have not, ask that they return the book and refund their money. Tell them that you are not a book agent, but that you are interested in giving this message of comfort and cheer to everybody, and that if they are not sufficiently interested in a fact that so closely concerns them —that millions now living will never die—you wish to put the book into the hands of someone who will be interested. Say that paper is too scarce and the time too linjited to supply everyone with a copy, and that we supply only those who will read. But if they have read the book, you then have an open field for placing a copy of “The Finished Mystery”. The booklet “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” should then be considered as merely a lengthy canvass or opening wedge for people who cannot decide from a short canvass whether or not the information is worth $2.75. We anticipate that the “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” booklet will convince all such that they should get “The Finished Mystery” and ascertain whether they are likely to be among these millions and what conditions they will have to comply with to be of that number. Impress upon them that the booklet is merely a report of a lecture on the subject and does not contain the convincing proof that “The Finished Mystery” gives, but that the booklet might well be considered a help to set forth and keep fresh before the mind the points that must be settled to prove that “millions now living will never die”. Having these points clearly in mind as they read the Seventh Volume, they will find that the various proofs therein will confirm what is stated in a general way in the booklet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In approaching those who have read the “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” booklet, offer them the three books for $2.85; or, in other words, offer to rebate them 15 cents on the cost of the “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” ; that they may still have the advantage of the offer of the three articles at $2.85. This is the regular combination offer for the three. If you find some who have not read the book but who see your earnest desire to have them read It, and who then promise to read it in two weeks or so, the book could be left with them. A second call should be made to find out whether they have read it; for this opens up a further mdrket for the Seventh Volume and The Golden Age.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">meetings, as recommended recently in a letter suggesting a series of meetings on this topic. It is a message that will go forth by mail to a large number of people never before reached by the truth. Hence, the publicity that is being planned will be linked up with the Seventh Volume, The Golden Age, and, in fact, all the Studies in the Scbiptubes ; for they are the only books which tell that “millions now living will never die”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>What of Immortal Souls ?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In going from house to house you will meet people who will bring up the subject of the immortality of the soul as an offset to .the message “millions now living will never die”. These people should be brought step by step to realize the truth of our message. Supply them with a copy of the “Talking With the Dead” booklet on the same conditions above outlined for supplying to others a copy Of the booklet, “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”. Impress upon them that it is not spiritistic propaganda, but that it demonstrates the impossibility of talking to the dead, because they are dead; but that at the same time it admits that communications can be held with spirits and tells who these spirits are. This booklet, too, should be sold only on condition that it be read. Then follow up and see that it is read; for it is the opening wedge for “The Finished Mystery”, or in some instances merely the opening wedge for the “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” booklet, and later “The Finished Mystery”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Talk of Future</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">We need no longer show that the book applied to the war and foretold conditions that actually came then. These predictions have come to pass, and people are not so much interested in the fact that a book once told about them. What they want is something that will tell them of the future. Hence, “The Finished Mystery” steps to the front rank again in taking the prospective instead of the retrospective view.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Let The Gospel Convince</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In your canvass do not attempt to tell why millions now living will never die. Merely touch the salient points. Tell them that you have mentioned only the chief points; that in the 24th chapter of Matthew there are 51 verses setting forth 26 different signs which Jesus said would mark the time when “millions now living will never die”; and that they can read that chapter for themselves and see whether the events prophesied therein are not happening before their very eyes. Point out that this chapter merely narrates what one writer has to say, but that there are 66 books in the Bible which tell the same story. “The Finished Mystery” explains what each prophet and apostle predicted concerning the time in which we are now living; and they can have the heart satisfaction that comes from absolute knowledge of this as given to us in the Bible. But impress upon them that they cannot get the information without reading; that you are not attempting to give full proof, but merely calling their attention to the book that contains it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In your canvass use the phrase “millions now living will never die” again and again, so that when ypu leave this message will be impressed indelibly upon their minds. In your work remember that the message is being given “for a witness’—not merely the one witness, but the message is to be left as a testimony, in the same sense as the word testimony Is used in Luke 21:13, where it is stated that being persecuted, being cast into prison, brought before kings and rulers, “shall turn to you for a testimony”. In Luke’s use of the word it means that this gospel is to be preached as a witness to serve the same purpose as the persecutions did—tis a testimony in our behalf. Hence it is not merely once witnessed, but witnessed until everybody knowing of it is repeating it, wondering about it, investigating it, and believing it; for it is the message that the church leaves as a heritage of comfort for the world to buoy’ them up in their time of severest trouble. Of course, not all will believe; but the witness is to be given; and in giving the witness, the Apostle Peter tells us, we are hastening the coming of the day of the Lord by supplying the fuel that will set on fire the heavens (ecclesiastical ruling powers), causing them to dissolve as a result of the heat of public Investigation and discussion, which will in the same manner melt the elements, the various parties and sects that comprise and hold up the present order of tilings. So then, in our Lord’s own words, it is stated that the end shall come when this gospel, “millions now living will never die”, shall have been preached as a witness; and the Apostle Peter adds that the giving of this message is really hastening the end, and therefore our own glorification.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>How Long</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">How long will it be before the end of our work—until this gospel of the kingdom, “millions now living will never die&quot;, is preached in all the world for a witness? And how long will it take? That depends on the amount of effort put forth hastening the presence of the Day of the Lord. In other words, our end will come after the witness is given that hastens the day of the Lord and our glorification.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Awakened Interest Open Field for Gospel</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">These suggestions should be pry; into use in following up the wide distribution of the special issue of The Golden Age for September 29. The message that this issue contains is an important one; and in going from house to house you have impressed upon the people that you believe it to be important. With the assistance of the letter addressed to the “Man of the House” it is expected that there will be a larger percentage read than In any other distribution of literature previously made. Having this message then, that “millions now living will never die”, you will no doubt find the next few months a season of encouragement in the work. Endeavor to redeejn the time as much as possible from other duties to make use of this interest, as oi nerwise the distribution will be more or less in vain. People should not be left to themselves to send in their subscriptions because interested. Generally they will wait for your return; they are expecting you; they are holding their subscription to give to you because you delivered them a sample. They want you to get the credit of the subscription and do not wish to send it to the home office. If you delay to call upon them, they will think that the magazine is not altogether necessary. They will have forgotten about the cheer and comfort and the optimistic feelings that were theirs during the, week past; and in two or three months later they will become more thoroughly convinced that they do not need the magazine. It is, then, while they are in a receptive attitude of mind and open for further information that the canvass should be made; and while they are enjoying the message that it contains they will be swept off their feet as you tell them the further and grander message that “millions now living will never die”. There is not a person on the face of the earth, aside from the truth friends, who wants to die; and when you look at the lady of the house and tell her that she has excellent chances of never dying, or when you tell a man who is interested in life or business ventures that he is never • going to die, surely it is a message of comfort. Therefore it behooves each one who possesses it, and who has the heart satisfaction of knowing it to be a fact, to give out the blessing to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Up to this writing we can give no report of the work beginning with the 21st, but we hope that through the activities of the friends in the next few months reports will show an increased subscription list and also a larger circulation of “The Finished Mystery”.</span></p>

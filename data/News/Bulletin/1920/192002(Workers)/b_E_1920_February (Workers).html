<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SALES DEPARTMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(Workers) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 1, l&gt;20</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">D</span><span class="font3">RIVE home these facts: First, that the world has ended and the Golden Age—the Lord’s kingdom—is in process of being Inaugurated; Second, that the International Bible Students are the only ones announcing the Lord’s kingdom, and that theirs is the only organization which suffered persecution during the war ns n result of religious work; Third, that the seven leaders, who were sentenced to twenty years in the Federal Prison, are co-edttors of The Golden Age; Fourth, that the preachers nre shirking their responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Objects of the work</span><span class="font3"> in order of importance </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1. Beneficial Influence of the work In ths development of the character of the worker*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">; &nbsp;&nbsp;2. (a) Having The Golden Age visit the home</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">every other week; (b) Having the people learn</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">. what is in The Golden Age hy readlng-lt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I 3. The witness of the truth to each one with ■ whom you come in contact in the canvass, i particularly those not accepting samples for examination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">4. The renumeration from the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Talking with the Dead with ■ The Golden Age is a tremendous inducement r for subscriptions. This subject has been given | unprecedented prominence in the papers, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font3"> nearly all the people are desirous of more information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In canvassing, the procedure Is the same a* outlined in the November 15 Bulletin; first, a distribution of samples, followed in a day or so by a canvass for subscriptions, at which time the Talking with the Dead booklet Is offered as a premium with each subscription taken. This method, we believe, best accomplishes the objects to be attained in the canvassing, and appears as a new Inducement ta those who &gt;&nbsp;may have decided not to take the magazine bffause of its cost, or for some other minor objection; additionally, it gives a witness for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Talking with Tub Dead will be sold to each worker at 10 cents per copy, (plus the carriage charges), by the Director, the understanding being that the worker will dispose of his copies only as premiums with subscriptions and will not resell them to any of his friends or acquaintances for ten cents, or dispose of them by personal distribution to soma of his friends. Hence, in accepting Talking with the Dead from th* Director, It Is with the express understanding that the 10-cent rate applies only to those given as a premium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Premiums will not be given</span><span class="font3"> with renewal subscriptions. The book. Talking with thi Dead, will be sold at 50 cents to those renewing their subscriptions. It will be supplied with a six months’ subscription at $1.00 for the two, or a four months’ subscription and Talking with the Dead at 75 cents. For such books as th* worker disposes of otherwise than with a subscription, he will pay the Director 25 cent* each, plus the carriage charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another offer that might appeal to some </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age for one year, with Talking with the Dead and a copy of Pastor Russell’s Sermons as a premium, for $2.00. The two books might go together in some instances, but in the majority of cases no doubt the people will desire The Golden Age and Talking with the Dead for $1.50. Where the canvasser thinks the people are so situated as to afford the extra 50c, this offer might be brought to their attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The extra cost</span><span class="font3"> of ten cents will, we believe, renumerate the worker by quick turn-over; that is, more subscriptions will be obtained, assuring a larger profit at a smaller commission than would a few subscriptions at a larger commission. Each class member Is entitled to one copy of Talking with the Dead at 10 cents for bis own use, all additional copies desired will be sold him at 25 cents and retailed at 50 cents. This is absolutely necessary, as the books </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font3">10 cents are supplied at a loss; and It Is only with a view to building up the subscription list that the bocks are supplied at this price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">From some localities</span><span class="font3"> we learn that the method of first distributing samples is not io successful ns outright canvassing. Before any change is made we suggest that such change be authorized by this office, and a thorough trial of the sample distribution suggestion be made. Merely canvassing the people, in ths ordinary sense of that term, is not the object to be attained, but rather to give the people a taste of the truth. Such letters as the following indicate that people are greatly Interested in the contents of ths magazine.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“1 recently saw a copy of your magazine for a brief time on a train and it struck me as a remarkable issue from point of view and the wide scope of subjects covered* a far better presentation than the --. I wish you would be good enough to send me a couple of old, or late* issues, as I would like to look them over a little more at leisure. Frequently one gets hold Of a most unusual issue of a magazine and succeeding numbers are sometimes very mediocre. Kindly tell me also where this publication can be purchased, if at all, also what the yearly rate is and now often published.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“This being the first time I ever tried canvassing, you can see why subscriptions come slowly. Each one I have taken has been from those who asked me if it Is published by the followers of Pastor Russell; and when they heard that it is, they all seemed aaxious to subscribe.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Quite a few connect this work with that of our beloved Pastor. People everywhere are down on the preachers ; we have had some really bad ones here. Have found much sympathy for our brethren, but some bitter opposition from Catholics.”</span></p>

Then the sister . turned her conversation along the religious line and the woman said : ‘Pastor RusseH’s teaching was good •nough for me.’ On the strength of that remark the sister sold her a Scenario, and she seemed glad to know that the Society had such a book.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“One of the sisters found a lady that at first, thinking the canvasser was connected with some one of the denominations, told her: ‘No, she found all she desired in Pastor Russell's books and The Watch Tower’, The remarkable feature of this case was that we are not acquainted with the party, and she has never attended our meetings.”</span></p>

He said that the church people had plenty of the very best of literature, but that they would not read it; they threw it on the streets; but at the same time, nearly every man he met had his pockets full of Pastor Russell’s tracts. In another instance I was told that quite a prominent minister endeavored to hold a meeting at a certain schoolhouse, but failed to awaken any interest. He preached every night until about the middle Of the week. Then he told the people that the devil had them ; that it was no use for him to waste his time preaching there: that he would quit. And quit he did. The ‘burning* of the tares is in evidence?*</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“One colored woman told me this week that she was really disgusted with the preachers and the churches; that they had asked their preacher to resign, but he said tie was not going to accept the invitation. She further said : ‘The preachers used to be servants, but now they are the bosses? Their time Is short?*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In order that subscribers</span><span class="font3"> may be assured of the best service possible, workers should, as soon as the subscription is taken, see to it that it is mailed to this office at the end of the day’j work. Do not hold the subscriptions for a daj or two, or until the end of the week, and then hand them to the Director. But the remittance is to be made to the Director at the end of the week, and he will remit for tbe total number of subscriptions sent in by the class. The subscrip tions themselves must be sent in the same day rhey are taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">number of three months’ subscriptions </span><span class="font3">that were accepted are expiring. We trust that each worker has a note of such subsrlptions and will see to it that he recanvasses the subscriber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A commission of 25c will be granted for each renewal subscription for one year, 12c for a 6 month renewal, 8c for a four month renewal, and 6c for a 3 month renewal. Such subscrip tions should be so marked across the face of the subscription blank viz.—“Renewal”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Further, it might be well to mention to all subscribers that The Golden Age does not follow the practise of some other magazines; namely, not removing the name from the list at the expiration of the subscription, and later billing the people for such copies as they receive after the date of expiration. As soon as the subscription expires the name is removed from the list, unless a renewal Is sent us within the next few days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">There are over 75,000</span><span class="font3"> subscribers on the list at this writing. No doubt the subscription list will mount higher as soon as the canvassing is begun with the Talking with the Dead booklet It is hoped that we cau begin the shipment of these booklets by the first of the month. Better service will be given the subscribers, as by the end of this month we will be in shape to take care of the mailing ourselves. Heretofore it has been necessary to entrust this to the work of a commercial mailing-house, which no doubt accounts In part for the fact that subscribers have not recieved their magazines promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May the Lord continue to bless you in hl? service as you seek to herald forth the blessin, he has in store for the world of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By his grace, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Your brethren and servants in the Lord,</span></p>

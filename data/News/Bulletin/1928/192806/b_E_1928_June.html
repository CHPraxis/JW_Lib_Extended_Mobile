<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>GOOD SOLDIERS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life [mode of making a living]; that he mag please him who hath chosen, him to be a soldier.&quot;—2 Timothy</span><span class="font1"> 2; 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">W</span><span class="font1">HEN a man enlists in the army, he turns his back on civilian lite for the time lie is enlisted. He may have to cook, keep books or do stenographic work, wash clothes, etc., in the army camp, hut this he does in tire order of army life; but he is no longer a member of the citizenry of the world, and this work releases the majority of the soldiery to do the hand-to-hand fighting at the immediate front</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the battle of Armageddon (Judges 5:19) in which the Lord used two women, Deborah the prophetess and Jael (Judges 4:9), to bring about the deliverance of the Israelites, Deborah sang these words: “For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart [but no action], Why </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">abodest</span><span class="font1"> thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bieatings of the flocks? </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fot</span><span class="font1"> the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart. Gilead </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">abode</span><span class="font1"> beyond Jordan: and why did Dan </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">remain</span><span class="font1"> in ships? Asher continued [sat Still—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font1"> V.] on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches [creeks].&quot; Contrast the course of these with other tribes: “Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded [Heb., exposed to reproach] their lives unto the death in the high places of the [battle] field ... by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.” (Judges 5: 15-19) As in that historic battle, so today: the Lord has placed the brethren, whether elders or deacons, on a level with the sisters; the spirit -has been poured on all consecrated ones, and both sexes may now go forth preaching the kingdom message by the printed page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord. For ye shall not go out [of Babylon] with haste [as did the Israelites at the exodus ,from Egypt, when they had to wear their sandals and have a staff in hand at the eating of the Passover meal] nor go by flight [like the Israelites who were thrust out of Egypt by Pharaoh and had to go in such haste that they had to take with them their dough unleavened because they were in such a hurry that they had no time to leaven it].”—Isaiah 52:11,12,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is a voluntary matter. The Greater than Cyrus does not force any one to go up to Jerusalem to build the temple of the Lord: he does not thrust any one into the service, but leaves it optional. But those who do go out of Babylon to build the Lord’s temple need not fear; “for the Lord will go before you [as advance guard] ; and the God of Israel will be your rereward [your rear-guard].” Thus those forsaking all in Babylon that they may bear the Lord’s vessels to his temple and its service, have promise of the Lord’s leading, sustenance and protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Devil will not make any one &quot;haste” to leave Babylon and get into the Lord’s service; he does not want any one to take his &quot;flight” out of his organization to get to work in the Lord’s service. But those wbo desire to be volunteers, “willing in the day of his power,” will not delay further but will voluntarily haste themselves to get into the service before the victory is won by others. They will trust the Lord to go before and prepare conditions before them and to protect them also from the rear. They readily respond to the Lord’s Invitation : “Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing” or business relationship with the Devil’s Babylonish organisation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>METHODS OF WORK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">We have heard by telegraph from the fifty-one stations through which the message was broadcast. All report excellent reception. With this introduction for IB SA Week we trust that the general experience throughout the field is in keeping with the few reports we have thus far received. These reports tell of excellent success and the deep interest of the people. In time we shall have the full details from the directors. We hope that the next </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> can bring these to you; also that the report of IBSA Week may be more complete than that of any previous effort. We take this opportunity to ask all workers to check up their reports and see to it that the director has your report immediately. We will ask the directors to exercise particular care in the reporting of tbe activities of IBSA Week. We ask your cooperation that the director’s report may be a complete one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Workers entering the field at this time can do so with the assurance that the people are ready for the service that yon will render them. The work of the past few years has served as an opening wedge. Reports are being received that indicate that many of the people who in the past only heard the worker’s canvass are today ready for the books. The following is one letter of many we have received along this line:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I took an order or a dollar combination where a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harp</span><span class="font1"> had been placed before. Another lady wanted me to call back. This same woman almost showed me the door the 'last time I called, several years ago. She now took her stand for the Bible and against evolution. She is a church-woman.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Majority Favorable</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, influences are at work that are attempting to thwart the efforts that you are putting forth. Do not attach too much weight to those influences. If a show-down were called for you would probably find that the support given to the one who is manifesting the opposition would be negligible. Generally it is only the one who is in opposition who makes himself heard. Those who are in agreement generally do not express their agreement but they lend a support that we wish the workers could feel certain of. The following letter will, w<sup>r</sup>e trust, be encouraging, for it gives a demonstration of just bow much support the opposition can depend upon:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“It is very encouraging to hear the demand for Russellism, as the people call it. We sell it right over the preachers’ heads. A few days ago we delivered a set of seven </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures.</span><span class="font1"> As we stopped before the door as the delivery was being made, a Baptist preacher (white) came along. Brother Ross presented </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font1"> to him. He resisted the message, saying a lot of ugly things, and at the same time out came the man saying, ‘Did you bring the books to me? I am ready for them.’ Yesterday we chased a Dr. M. D. all over town selling books where he tried to spoil our sales.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“One num who purchased </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font1"> a few weeks ago said as Brother Ross entered the house, ‘Have you any more of Judge Rutherford’s books? I want them. I would not take ten dollars for that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font1"> book if I couldn’t get another.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Another said, ‘Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font1"> is the best I ever read and money couldn’t buy it. I want them all.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“A deacon in the Baptist church said, ‘I did not think much of Russell ism a few years ago, but I want those books. He (Brother Russell) told the truth.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Another Dr. said, ‘I burnt up that book once, but I want them, I am going to read them.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Over in Verda, La., last Sunday, the Baptist minister preached a terrible sermon against Russellism. Then he proposed a movement in the interest of his church, and asked all present to come forward and shake his hand to show that they would back the movement Everybody but one old lady went the other way. He dropped down in his chair and wept bitterly. She sat on the steps of the church with bowed head for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Yesterday she told me of this experience. I told her I was sorry her heart should be so crushed with sorrow, but I had the very thing that would heal it and straighten everything out in a manner pleasing to all. She took </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harp, Creation, Deliverance</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom.</span><span class="font1"> One week prior to this she had made a terrible stir because she saw one of their church deacons carrying what she called Russellite literature home under his- arm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Yesterday Brother Ross and I stepped ■ into Verda and chased the minister and two or three of the big boys by selling the books all over town. We sold 28 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedoms</span><span class="font1"> and 21 clothbound books to the flock. (See Joshua 23:9-11.) I wish more colporteurs would come down here. There is not much money here, but the few who can bny do so and loan their books to otliers.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Be Not Dismayed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, as those who oppose the message of truth And that the people are not with them they will probably voice more threats and try to show their power, but their threats are always built on the supposition that the people will back them up. You who are in the field should have your confidence and strength increased so as not to be dismayed by the course that these will take. The following letter is an example of the attitude of the people toward those who want to hold and exercise their selfassumed authority:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I am sending my first report. Hope it will meet with your approval. A Catholic lady was having trouble with a priest and a sister of charity, when one of our </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Message of Hope </span><span class="font1">tracts was left at her door. She read it and went to our headquarters and got some more and sent them to all the priests and sisters she knew, and left the church. They have tried bombing her house and made many threats of what they would do to her if she left the church, but she told them she would never come back. She said they should stop telling lies about the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bible; also that that man Rutherford is a great man and sure knows the Bible. I have to go back to see her and take her some more of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Message</span><span class="font1"> of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font1"> tracts. She says she is going to send them to every convent in the U. S.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lucy Pabk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many workers are having difficulty in attempting canvassing on Sundays. Here again we believe that the workers will find that by taking a definite stand for their rights they will be more respected than if they retreat and grant that the authorities have the power which they claim to have. Use the tactics employed in the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“We had a very enjoyable experience the first of the week, when all five of us were called before the Judge and were about to be sentenced and fined heavily. But the Lord was with us; and when w<sup>T</sup>e flatly refused to yield to the Devil’s organization and they found we were willing to go to jail for the sake of the truth, they quickly reconsidered the matter and let us go and the Judge bought a comhination </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance, Harp</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font1"> and talked very nice to us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">W. H. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stow,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nashville, Tenn.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Constitutional Rights</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">It is not unlawful to canvass for the hooks on Sunday, any more than any other day. This is a method of preaching the gospel, which the Constitution of the United States guarantees to each one the privilege of doing. If arrested hy any policeman or other officer, employ a local attorney and arrange for a trial. If fined, appeal the case immediately to a higher court. Notify this office as soon ns arrested, and we will take the steps to make a defense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To find that each recanvass of a territory places more books than a previous canvass is encouraging. It shows the extent to whleh the people are anxious for trie newer publications of the Society. We urge again the canvassing for book combinations. Some workers insist that they can not canvass for books, and as proof that they can not canvass for books they tell of instances where they have gone out to canvass with hooks and booklets and sold out of booklets but did not sell the books. The field is ready for a book canvass. It places the literature in the homes in a permanent form. Not only does it leave the message for the people, but they will make use of it because it is in form to be used for reference purposes. One brother, noticing the emphasis that was laid upon book canvassing and feeling that he was capable of canvassing only for booklets, determined to solve the matter and did so in this way. He decided to go into the field without any booklets and to take only book combinations. He soon found that he could easily sell book combinations when he had nothing else to demonstrate or talk about. We urge all the workers to train themselves in a similar fashion. The following letter is quite to the point on this subject;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I had the pleasure and joy of canvassing twenty hours in my rural territory during service week. I covered 82 homes, sold 35 homes;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">40 homes gave ‘no money’ as reason for not buying, and 7 homes were skeptical and biased; placed 87 books and booklets, consisting of 44 bound volumes and 43 booklets. Experience pleasant and joyful, with few exceptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Bound volumes sell more easily than ever before, which is In harmony with your instructions, showing the Lord's guidance that bound volumes should be pushed at this time. I have adopted a rule of first canvassing for the set of ten volumes and dropping to what is desired. Have sold ten-volume sets to several who were never canvassed before. My general experience is that most of the people who are not able to buy the hound volumes will not get any, hut say they will Walt until they can get the bound volumes; which is a very noticeable change in canvassing certain parts of my territory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">J. W, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Smith,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ruther Glen,</span><span class="font1"> Va.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Present Bound Books First</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Another method of handling book combinations is that suggested in the last paragraph of the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“In addition to the witnesses given, we left books at every house where culls were made, except about two or three. Altogether we placed 43 books and booklets, very few sales being only single books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“We picked up the lady superintendent of the Snnday school on her way to the schoolhouse where they were to have services in the afternoon, canvassed and sold her a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harp</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Last Days.</span><span class="font1"> A little farther on we called on a man who was mentioned as a member of the church, and canvassed and sold him a $1.18 combination. He stated that he bad bi'Cn informed that people were about selling books that tended to draw the people away from God and he would not want to huy or spend any time in reading books like that, that he did not want to do anything that would injure his faith, etc. He was getting ready to go down to the meeting; and I was quite desirous of making the sale before he went, and by the Lord's grace succeeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I find that I have better success canvassing for the bound books first, Baying nothing ahout the smaller ones until the canvass for the larger ones is finished and a sale made or not made; then I take up the canvass for the smaller ones, which can be made very brief. A far better witness can be given with the larger books, and that, of course, Is the main object to be kept in view.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Clabence Scott,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Old Town, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">IBSA Week has prepared the way for a great witness for the coming summer. But in order to take full advantage of the opportunities of placing the literature It Is necessary for the director and the workers to be well acquainted with the conditions existing in the territory that they are working. As the work increases it is necessary to take into account many of the conditions that formerly played very little or no part in the work. One of the details that needs more attention Is the different talking points used in a canvass. To be effective a convnss should not go over the people's heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It should talk to them of things In ■which they are Interested. It should discover how to tie together the things in which the people are interested and the books that you are offering. Therefore, when you go tn work tn your territory keep in mind that your work should produce information that will be of assistance when the territory Is recanvassed. Workers’ meetings are the proper time to emphasize what you discovered in canvassing the territory. You should be able to tell the workers what the people are most interested in. Then the workers can take up the matter of trying to discover the different talking points that may be used to show that the books serve their interests and needs. It is also important to know how many of the people to whom you are selling literature are now purchasers and how many have purchased literature In the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This work becomes of more importance as our work becomes that of resales rather than that of new sales. Next it is Important to know how many of the people who own radios know of our programs and know Of the different stations that broadcast the message. Another point is to know the actual percentage of the homes you called at and found no one at home. In some sections of the territory workers will find from sixty to seventy-five percent of the people away from home. The director should be advised of these conditions so that he may arrange for those sections to be canvassed at some other time, when the people will be at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Stlf-Exc/rmatton</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A certain amount of self-examination is necessary on the part of the workers, particularly in determining the percentage of people that you actually canvass and sell book to. * We mention books, not booklets, because a record that is considered as hundred-percent efficient is that which is capable of selling a book combination to one out of every five persons actually canvassed fot the literature. Workers should be checking themselves to see how efficient their canvasses are, and they should take steps to build up their canvasses and to discover how to approach the people and how to say the things that will Interest the people. Toward perfecting your methods in the field we recommend schooling or coaching the workers; that Is, arrange for some one to go with you to the door as an observer and to bring to your attention the manner in which they would have handled the same canvass. You no doubt can get some points as to their procedure, and they will, no doubt, get a number of points from your procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is no one best method of canvassing; and the worker can best discover the rut he has gotten into by hearing some one else canvass for the books, even though that party may not be so efficient as the worker himself. If at first you are a little timid about having some one go with you to the door, then let the director arrange for one of the workers to overhear your canvass without your being aware of it and arrange for that worker to mention to yon how he would have handled the same person. Of course it does not necessarily mean that you have to adopt the other’s methods. This coaching of one worker by another worker should be arranged for by the director; hut it needs the close cooperation and help of each worker. Workers’ meetings should allow time for one worker to canvass another. This should be done at least once each month. But this la a demonstration under ideal conditions, whereas having a worker with you enables him to see how you handle a canvass; and that brings out unexpected topics for discussion and handling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Workers should rememher that a new voice is a strange voice, and consequently it is necessary for them to be very clear and distinct in the pronunciation of their words. Do not employ rhetoric, nor make your canvass a singsong affair; but yet see to it that your canvass is clear and plain and in terms that the people can understand and appreciate.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Radio Advantages</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Whenever possible refer to some work or undertaking that is quite generally known in the neighborhood. When such an effort is put forth as the nation-wide hookup that opened up IBSA Week, be quick to take advantage of such instances and associate them with your call; and if you can do so in such a way as to identify yourself with the message appreciably, it will be an advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The following letter, though It is quite a marked incident Indicates and emphasizes the advantages of following up radio lectures, or at least arranging to canvass in connection with or shortly after radio broadcasts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Sunday, thirteen of the friends and I worked until 12:30 p. ni. then went to a restaurant where I had previously made arrangements to get Brother Rutherford’s lecture over the radio. It came in fine completely through. Some twenty people listened attentively. We Immediately returned to the field work. The first home I called upon had a radio. I said to the man who came to the door, 'I call as a representative of the I. B. S. A. Judge Rutherford is its president’ ‘Come right in,’ he said, ‘I hpve just heard him from New York, clear and plain. Have you any of his books?’ He bought </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, Hell, Prosperity Sure</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Our Lord’s Return,</span><span class="font1"> and said, ‘The Judge told us that the Bihle Students would call on us with the books, but I never thought that one would be at my door in twenty minutes. This is sure fine. Who could ask for better service ?’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">We trust that the workers will appreciate the advantages that are before them in the work offered by the next few months and employ these advantages to the fullest extent in obtaining the best results possible in the field work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With Christian, greetings, we are</span></p>

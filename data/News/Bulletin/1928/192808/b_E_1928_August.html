<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“When thou [thyself ] hast made an end of reading this book, ■ ■ ■ thou shalt hind a stone to it, . and cast it into the midst of Euphrates [the people who are io he turned aside from, .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babylon, Revelation 16:</span><span class="font2">12].”—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jeremiah 51:63.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">O</span><span class="font2">UR heavenly Father arranged in the making of his plan that every bit of knowledge of himself and of hi.tr beneficent designs for tiis creatures should reach h’s own people.and all other folks tlirsui.gii the reading of books. Jehovah's will regarding the course that Jesus should pursue w.is found •written In ■the volume of the Book’. God’s will, so far as we, the followers of Jesus, are concerned, is likewise found written in the stuno Book. The great trouble, however, has been that very, very few have understood the Book. It remained for God himself in bls own due time -to provide means whereby those who hungered and thirsted • after righteousness might have his Word tn Simple language, so that they could cos-iprabend. Every last one of ns who is really iu the truth got his knowledge of God's will for ps from readfog books.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Read and Cast</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">&gt; And now, in his loving-kindness, Jehovah has given us' another book. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font2"> is a bright fl n sb of light from God cut of his temple, and ifoe many, many appreciative letters sent to 'Brother Rutherford prove that the earnest fa 1th-fnl: followers of the Lord are doing exactly what </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">■Jehovah </span><span class="font2">through his prophet Jeremiah, as ■mjbted above, requested. First, read and digest the book, and then get behind it with all the strength and vitality we’ve got in us and heave for all we’re worth. Please note how the Lord pictured the fact that there would bo hard work and effort involved in giving the witness. The book was cost away out out into the middle- of the waters, not. just rolled oil' the bank at any convenient place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Understanding of the Plan</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some might argue that the book here men-Honed has reference to the Bible Itself. It could rv refw- to the bare Bible. The preachers and other agencies have been circulating the Bible freely for a great many years; but how many have underr.tood it? “Let [the people] </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hear,</span><span class="font2"> and say, It is tlie truth.” (Isaiah 43: ») “In t|pt day. [which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tiie Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> shows refers., to the present time] shall the deaf </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hear</span><span class="font2"> [understand] (lie words of Ilie book.” (Isaiah 29:18) Verse 12 proves that it would not be sufficient to give the people merely the printed Bible. Jehovah has graciously arranged that in his due time the' divine plan would be made plain and clear by means of books. ‘Publish peace, publish salvation.’ (Isaiah 92:7) “Publish the name of the Lord.” (Deuteronomy 32:3) “[This] gospel must first be published among all nations.” — Mark 13:10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■., •</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>METHODS OF WORK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">August, 1928, has two important features. The first is the distribution of the second new book of the year, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government.</span><span class="font2"> The second is IBSA Week, August 26 to September 3 inclusive. With the addition of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font2"> to the recent bound publications of the Society there is now available to the public a set of five volumes. The campaign with the five volumes will begin during IBSA Week. The five volumes will be offered to the public at the specially reduced price of $1.98 for the five books.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Set of Books</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The Idea of a set of books is maintained by adhering to the same general design, and yet the set of hooks is made more attractive by changing the color of the cloth. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font2"> contains sixteen color plates. More so than those of the other volumes, these color plates are new to Americans. Most of the prints from which the reproductions were made had to be purchased in Europe. They were not available in America. The color illustrations in the five volumes would cost $16.80 if they were purchased from any of the leading art stores in America and Europe. Here these valuable color plates are used to Illustrate the subject matter of the volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The message of truth is what we desire to bring to the attention of the people, not ouly to adults who will read, but to the children who are growing up. These books, then, bring to the adults the mature and orderly presentation of the message and to the children pictures together with excerpts from the message of the book. Hence, if the child is young, he can read the excerpts and have implanted in his young mind seeds of truth that will remain throughout life.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Combination</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Tbe $1.98 price Is an extraordinarily low one for five books. Generally people will recognize that they can not purchase a novel for much less than 75c to $1.50. Oftentimes people do not recognize the value. They merely look upon books aS requiring a great amount of time to read. It is, of course, necessary for the worker to stress the real value of the books and to present all of the favorable arguments so that the matter may be made to appeal to the people and a favorable decision be made by them. It goes without saying that the workers think the books should be In the home, otherwise they would not be In the field. Hence it is w<sup>T</sup>ell for all workers to consult with one another in order that they may ascertain the reasons other workers have and the arguments they present in placing the books before the people. Remember that when other workers discuss the canvass with you, or if they accompany you to the door, they do not do so with the idea that you are to adopt their methods or canvass. They- do so merely that you may see how they do tbe same work that you are doing. The obligation rests finally upon each worker to employ the best methods possible, and this of course means that each will endeavor to increase his ability to present the books to the people in as favorable a way as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following letter received by two of the colporteurs from people to whom they sold books indicates that the worker is appreciated. We are certain that there would be more of such letters if the people only knew how to get in touch with the colporteurs. Since, then, we have this indication that the people appreciate the books, our responsibility is all the greater to urge them to take the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Dear Messrs. Cahoun and Smith:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tour welcome letter received a few days since and we enjoyed every word of It. Now about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the hook.</span><span class="font2"> It is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">wonderful</span><span class="font2"> and a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">joy.</span><span class="font2"> I am still reading it It Is a worried mind and troubled heart healer. I can’t live without my book. It is the truth; I believe every word of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Mrs. Covipgton and I so often speak of you and wonder how you are getting along with your books. 1 trust you are selling in every home and that the people will not let this opportunity pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Mrs. Covington said she is ready for another argument any time you are. She said I have read more since I’ve had the book than I had for a long time. Of course I have, for I have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">something</span><span class="font2"> to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Wishing you both much joy, happiness and health, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Very respectfully,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mbs Mattie King Woon.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Resou reef ulness</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Resourcefulness in handling each sale is necessary. Keeping in mind the person you are addressing, and remembering that the person you are addressing is the greatest thing you have to handle in presenting your subject and that, so far as you can, you are going to present it in their way of reasoning, if you can anticipate their objections or their obstacles, answer the objections you expect and you will have accomplished much toward placing tile books, for generally the reason why the books should not be purchased seems more Important after It has been voiced than If it has not been spoken out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“No matter where I canvass of late, when people are ready to buy I find they prefer bound books to booklets in most cases. I am selling more bound books tlrnu booklets, as three books are being offered for $1.18. I am finding the following to be the best way to close a sale: ‘Pay me (price of book or combination of books). Keep this (or these books) and start reading It (or them) tonight. You will say it is the best investment of a small sum of money you ever made in your life.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I canvassed a house recently. Lots of children around. Mother was not home. I spotted a man in the rear. He turned out to be their dad. I thought I would get, ‘Large family, no money,’ as an excuse. I thought I would see if I could not head him off, and said, ‘You have a large family. Pay me $1.18. Keep these three books and start them reading tonight.’ To my surprise he took all three books.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>IBS A Week</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">We make mention of IBSA Week and give our observations on the results so that you may be in a better position to see to it that IBSA Week in August profits by the experiences of IBSA Week in May. We have urged directors to plan to work that territory in which the least number of books have been placed in the past. The $1.98 offer will probably enjoy the most success when it is offered to people who do not have any of the other books. In practically every class assignment there are towns in which better success has been had than in other towns. It is quite possible that u study of the times in which the different towns were canvassed would pretty nearly account for the difference in circulation of literature. IBSA Week will probably find the largest number of friends free to devote time to the service. Beginning with September more duties have to be taken up, and consequently we urge all to plan to put forth an extra effort during the last week of August. Consequently it is recommended that all class meetings be canceled for the two Sundays and, instead of class meetings, we urge that the directors arrange for the different ones out in canvassing parties to meet for lunch at noon and in the evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition Labor Day will be a holiday that can be devoted to the service. We trust that every one will plan to participate in the work on these three days, and as often during the. week as it is possible for them to engage in the work. Sunday is one of the most profitable times to engage in the service. We have advice from many of the colporteurs that they iiud it better to canvass Sundays </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and to take </span><span class="font2">another day off.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Three Favorable Days</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Since, then, IBSA Week holds two Sundays and one holiday for such service, we trust that all will plan to take advantage of the favorable opportunities the week presents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The Lord is surely blessing the Sunday morning service. I had thought that, canvassing during the week, I would not go on Sunday except service weeks, etc.; that Sunday service was specially for those who can not go during the week. But the more I thought of it, the more I wanted to go, even if I had to rest one day during the week. So this morning I made up my mind to do so, and what a joyful time I The first place I called they could not buy. At the next place I sold a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font2"> at the next a set of ten volumes, the next a set of nine volumes and an extra </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span><span class="font2"> The lady who bought the set of nine at this place was visiting and in an adjoining room, but overheard the canvass and came out saying, “I have seen those books before and made up my mind that I would not let them pass me again. I am so glad to get them.” At the next house I sold a set of nine, and in the next fouud the lady very anxious for them, but could not buy right then and wanted me to call tomorrow. A hard rain stopped the canvassing at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“We are Indeed thankful for your many helpful suggestions and always find that we have the best success and get the greatest blessings ourselves by following them as closely as possible. The Lord be praised for his goodness to us all!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“We find, too, as stated in a recent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin, </span><span class="font2">that the people want cloth-bound books. That was thirty volumes sold in about two hours this morning, and not one booklet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sb. G. C. Powell, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Colporteur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">IBSA Week will, we trust, see the greatest witness that has ever been accomplished, even exceeding the figures published in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font2">as to what was accomplished during the August, 1927, IBSA Week.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Necessary Grace Supplied</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">“As I had so few books, I did not put in full time each day but figure it amounted to about three days in all. Have sold practically all books the class has on hand, so hope my books will be here today as I have deliveries to make.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Tell the friends not to hold back from service any longer. I had thought I was making the best of my opportunities, but. found I had not been doing anything. If you want to go, the way will be opened. I have five children at home, leave my eldest (23 years of age) at home to keep house. I have no car, and unless I am picked up I have to walk three miles into town and then carry my books around in a grip. I weigh 105 pounds. But I am telling this to encourage others. Get out into the work 1 Get a taste of the blessings I You can do more than you think you can, if you try. And it is such a joy to bring the message to the people. No one dreads ridicule or discourtesy more than I. The first two days I kept up only by saying, ‘It is for my </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">King,</span><span class="font2"> why worry?’ Now I have more confidence in meeting the public, and when I get the cold shoulder I give a witness anyway and go on to the next, who will probably buy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“This morning I sold a combination of three to a professor whom I had dreaded to approach and who just knew he did not want any. He had lost a daughter. He took also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Where </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the Dead?</span><span class="font2"> So don’t get discouraged or think you can’t do it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mbs. Della Towne, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Colporteur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font2"> thought I had demonstrated that an even I one-dollar bill is the best price to charge for a .set of books and that fractional prices should hot be used. My reasons were good aS far as convenience in making change and carrying are concerned, and I have been very successful, averaging seventeen dollar sales a day over a period of six months at a stretch. But I have just learned something, and know you will be interested.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Advantage of Fractional Prices</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">“Out in the work with a brother who is in the Pioneer Colporteur work I have been accustomed to trim him a little as to number of books sold, but I found he was creeping up on the money end of It and finally went hy and is still ahead. Inquiring into it I found he was selling </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity, Last Days, Deliverance, Harp</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font2"> for one thirty-eight and making it go fine. He does not say ‘one dollar and thirty-eight cents’, but merely ‘one thirty-eight’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Unknown to him I tried the combination for a half-day and to my great surprise found-that a combination of two booklets and three hound books goes just as easily ns three booklets and two bound books; and the extra thirty-eight cents in the course of a day means five or six dollars extra money, and that means a great deal to a colporteur, and even to some other Bible Students that I know.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“Thursday afternoon we worked in the sub</span><span class="font1">urbs of Tupelo, Miss., but accomplished </span><span class="font2">very </span><span class="font1">littie as </span><span class="font2">far ns the placing of books was concerned. Friday morning we decided to try a new field and skipped to a point eight miles north of Tupelo on the Tupelo and Birmingham road. Our success was all we could have wished for. From noon until seven in the evening we worked with all the zeal and energy we possessed, selling eighteen 81.50 combinations con</span><span class="font1">sisting </span><span class="font2">of three cloth bound volumes, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp,</span><span class="font2"> and four booklets. During the entire afternoon there were but four homes entered, where we failed to leave some books or booklets, arid two of those expressed \p eagerness for the books-bnt had no money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Saturday morning dawned with a downpour of rain and indications that It would continue throughout the day. But we set*out in the rain where we left off the evening liefore, with seven $1.00 combinations, one extra </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Crear tion,</span><span class="font2"> four </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Harps</span><span class="font2"> and a few booklets. Althougli it was raining and muddy and. sloppy when we reached our point of starting, of. the first three: houses canvassed we sold a $1.50 combination at each house. You can imagine what an en-•' couragement this was In the face of such difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“We had disposed of all our combination sets and were working off the remaining </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Harps</span><span class="font2"> and booklets when Sr. A. stopped a wagon full of negroes on their way to town and canvassed them for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font2"> and booklets. They were all very eager for the hooks but had no money -and one, of them said'to Sr. A.: ‘White folks, I sho wants them books, and I knows you’s gwiue to sell ’em To you gits to town. Won’t you please let me take these books and leave you de. money at Roper &amp;&nbsp;Jones store? I’ll sho git de* money when I gits to town.’ He took the books with him and. true to his word, made good his promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“We le&quot; books at the homes of the best and ■ most prosperous-looking people in the country, all of whom were white people; and we can not help but hope that the precious truths contained therein will open their eyes and cause the rich blessings of the Lord to flow into their lives.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Combination of Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">'&quot;Lie report of IBSA Week indicates that th'n-e are a great number of individual volumes being gold. There has been much, progress made in canvassing for combinations of books, as in-stwd of booklet combiralions; but we believe ili&quot;t ihe thrce-volrjne offer at $1.18 and the two-volume offer nt 78c (with two booklets at fife) are rust being presented with the full emphasis of their bargain value, and consequently- </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">j </span><span class="font2">!l.e worke-:; drop r&gt;o quickly to a lower-priced combination. Our records indi.vtle that there W'<sup>s</sup>ro about 18115 81:18 eon:binu.tion3 sold during ■ ' IBSA Week, about 1325 78-? combinations and </span><span class="font1">about </span><span class="font2">32,5122 indlv'dual copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deiivcranee</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span><span class="font2"> Of course, much of this moy be accoumed for as errors in reporting ; but even if we make all due allowance for sneh errors, there are still a great number of individual volumes being sold.

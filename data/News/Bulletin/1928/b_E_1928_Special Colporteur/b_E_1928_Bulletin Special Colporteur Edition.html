<p><span class="font7">SPECIAL COLPORTEUR</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">EDITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TO THE LORD’S FIELD FORCE:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">JN the United States, Canada and Newfoundland there are now more than fourteen hundred colporteurs. They are zealous, earnest and enthusiasttc. You are one of them. In addition thereto nearly every important city in the land has a class organization that is awake to the importance of the hour. These are bringing the message of good news to the people. The time has come when God’s Name shall be exalted in the earth. “Proclaim his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his Name is exalted.” (Isaiah 12: 4, margin). In times of old God “made a name for himself”. (2 Samuel 7: 23). It was a great privilege then to be on the Lord’s side. Now Satan’s world has ended. The great battle of Armageddon is approaching. God has placed his King upon his throne; and now Jehovah’s Name shall be exalted amongst the people. To his faithful servants Jehovah says: “Ye are my witnesses that I am God.” Never was such a privilege granted to man as that now offered to God’s anointed. Jehovah bids these to go and tell the groaning creation to wipe away their tears, lift up their heads and learn that the day of deliverance and the time for a righteous government has come. When the people see it they will greatly rejoice. It is a real joy to bring a message of consolation to the people and even a greater joy to have a part in vindicating the name of our loving God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every anointed one in the field of service is the ambassador of the Lord and a comforter to the people. The joyful organization of Zion is marching on to complete victory under the leadership of earth’s rightful Governor. Those who walk in the light have partnership with God and with Christ in lifting the burdens from the heart of man. What a marvelous occupation this; and you have a part in it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your joy and zeal will serve as an example and encouragement to others to enter the field of service and be witnesses unto the Lord. Be of good courage and know that the Lord loves you because of your love and devotion to him and that he will preserve and keep you. I give thanks unto my God that I am privileged to be a soldier with you in the army of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With much love and best wishes,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brother and servant by his grace,</span></p><img src="b_E_1928_Bulletin Special Colporteur Edition_files/b_E_1928_Bulletin Special Colporteur Edition-1.png" alt="" style="width:136pt;height:49pt;">
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>BULLETIN</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>SPECIAL COLPORTEUR EDITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Greetings in the fellowship of Christ!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Any colporteur’s success in the field depends primarily on his love for the Lord and his trust in him, his absolute confidence in the divine plan, and his regularity and perseverance in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Trusting in the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Only the Lord’s blessing makes at all possible the magnificent work which the colporteurs are doing in the field. The Lord loves immensely this little band of thoroughly consecrated and fully devoted' ones, and there is no doubt that they’are special objects of his protection and blessing. They have left all to follow in Jesus’ footsteps, giving all their understanding, all their heart, all their soul and all their strength to witnessing that Jehovah is God. Could any human being do more than that ? Surely not! No wonder the Lord loves them and watches over them. Therefore, dear brethren, go forth in the strength of the Lord. Ask him each day to use you to bring honor to his Name, to bless you as you serve him and to sustain you as he has promised; and the great Creator, whose promises never fail, will provide for those who “seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Faith in the Divine Plan</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Absolutely essential to success in placing the literature is unswerving faith in the divine plan. To the extent that one really believes the divine plan and visualizes the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth, to that extent his words and actions will display his faith. This, in our judgment, is, next to the blessing of the Lord, the foundation of success in the work. If one’s words and actions, his whole being, radiates his positive faith in what he is presenting, people are convinced. It’s not so much a matter of education, grammar, etc., as it is the conviction that one is right. Some of the apostles, while ignorant and unlearned men, were able, by the spirit of the Lord and by their own faith in what they were saying, to ■bring thousands to a knowledge of the truth in one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Don’t be timid! You are an ambassador of the great Jehovah God! Don’t be afraid of any person on earth! You have something which every last one of them wants; and if only they really knew what you have, they would hunt you up to get it. You have something for them far more important than food or raiment—you have eternal life for them. Before you can convince any one to take the literature, you yourself must be so thoroughly convinced that you have the only thing in life worth while that it sticks out all over you. Thus writes a successful colporteur who has been in the service many years:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In giving the witness to people who can scarcely get the necessary food, let alone books, it is necessary to impress them (1) with their need of our message; (2) with the unselfish and sympathetic motive behind our work; (3) with the phenomenally low price of our literature; (4)^.that the message is of greater importance and value to them than money, food, or clothes; (5) that the price is so very small that they can afford it. In many, many cases, this seems to be accomplished successfully only by the canvass for the set of ten books. A good canvass for the set of ten will prove the first four points to all who are of the meek and teachable class; it will sell to many of them, but of course it will fail in the majority of cases. However, by your victory</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">in proving your first four points, you are now in a position to make a quick flank movement with Number 6, by dropping off the set of seven, and on down till you have reached your prospect’s ability to purchase. Four-fifths of the victory lies in the canvass for the set of ten. That last dollar bill, that last fifty-cent piece, that last dime or nickel, will be frozen fast, unless you have thawed and jolted it loose with the canvass for the set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Despite the fact that unending bank failures, the great Florida hurricane a year and a half ago, the collapse of the Florida “boom” and the general depression, I am happy in the Lord’s providence to be privileged to enclose herewith the report of my banner week of sales for more than a year and a half. In September, 1926, I sold an exactly equal number of bound volumes and subscriptions, but only 47 booklets, as against the 136 sold during the week just ending tonight. In the former week, too, I had placed 17 full sets; whereas the 180 volumes this week comprise only seven sets of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies,</span><span class="font2"> and many more of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance and Creation;</span><span class="font2"> which indicates many more sales and hence a wider witness than in the other big week of a year and a half ago, up in West Virginia, where financial conditions were not so bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I thought, last year, that I had had phenomenal success in these terrible conditions just after the hurricane. The condition, which was then acute, has now become chronic and really worse. Then people were making repairs with the money which they had left over; now thousands are flat broke, with no ray of hope for the future. Their standards of living have been terribly reduced by necessity; and dismally and heart-brokenly they are endeavoring to readjust themselves to their straitened circumstances as they face their declining years, for it was largely the middle-aged and old who came to Florida’s sunny clime “for the rest of their lives”. To such an extent is this true that the district in which I have been working recently is sometimes dubbed “the old men’s paradise”. Translated into terms of human life, this phrase means that hundreds of old men in their declining years, their life partner silent in the dust, their life’s earnings crumbled into ashes, are to be found living in little huts and shacks—many of them built out of flood trash after the great storm and without anything but the barest necessities of existence in them—facing their declining health and strength and multiplying years alone, and without God and without hope in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Corresponding to this increase of distress and to my own surprise, my sales of literature have correspondingly increased. As an illustration of how the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">is “opening the ears of men” preparatory to “sealing their instruction” (Job 33: 16, 17), I submit a comparison of the figures of last year with those for this year up to and including March 24 in each case:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">And now some one asks, How do you manage to get the people in such pitiful financial circumstances to spend their money so liberally for books? And some one else, by their shrug and mingled expression of surprise and disapproval, if not of scorn, asks, And how does the brother have the heart to take their money and then tabulate and rejoice in his increased daily profits of $6.31?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I verily believe that it is this second question latent in the minds of the friends, but seldom expressed to * anybody, which bars the door of success to many as witnesses for Jehovah God. The only answer to these questions that I have, and the only effective way to overcome these two great difficulties of which I know, is suggested in the text, “Have faith in God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For example, I was eating dinner with an old-time brother and sister in the truth who are comfortably fixed, out of debt and with no family obligations. I have known and loved them dearly for years, but they have not become active in the service, as yet. Speaking of his neighbor, who had read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> and was showing some interest, I suggested that he go to him and take his subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> for a year. The brother’s reply was most discouraging and disappointing to me: “Oh, I’ll </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">give</span><span class="font2"> it to him; he has a family and is having a hard time. I can afford it better than he can.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Again, passing through a region not in my territory, I recalled having heard of an isolated sister who lived near where I had to pass. I took a little time off to look her up. She was, of course, happy to see a brother in the truth. She is the wife of a poor fisherman and has to peddle the fish to help make a living. She has her box of books, and was delighted to report that it was getting nearly empty. But sad to relate, her booklets were supplied to her free by another isolated sister in better financial circumstances, and while she </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sold</span><span class="font2"> the fish to the poor people for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cash,</span><span class="font2"> she </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gave away</span><span class="font2"> the books to the poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All of which being interpreted in plain English means that the dear brother thinks that shoes for the kiddies are more important than the message of Almighty God; and the dear sister thinks that fish is more valuable to the poor world than the bread of life. To wear the wedding garment means to do God’s work in God’s way. If it were his way to sell fish and give away books, then that would be most commendable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Answering your question directly, then, as to how I meet the reply, “No money,” I would say: I meet it first of all by fully convincing myself that I have something far more important and more valuable than money, shoes or fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1921 and 1922 when the profit per book was less than now, I was never cramped for funds. The Lord supplied all my needs for the work, including a car and the necessary gas and tires to run it. I never went in debt for a moment. The moral is, Have Faith in God! Go out into the pioneer work whole-heartedly and starve to death if your Creator can not make good his promise!!!—Matthew 6: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Remember this, dear brethren, every one you talk to will consider your proposition only as important as you make it to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Regularity in Your lYork</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You can not hope for success in the colporteur work unless you hammer away at it. We believe that in most cases where brethren are unable to make a go of it, the fault is due to irregularity in the work. It is just as necessary to have regular hours every day to insure success in the colporteur work as it is in any business. You surely would not expect success in anything done in a hit-or-miss way. Remember that proficiency comes with experience; the more experience, the more proficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do not let a day of poor sales keep you out of the field the next day. This you know: The Lord desires you to be active in his service. The adversary considers one actively proclaiming the message of the kingdom more dangerous than tens or hundreds believing the truth but taking no active part in its proclamation. Discouragement is the adversary’s most effective weapon. The Lord may sometimes permit his people to be subjected to discouraging experiences to test their loving devotion to him. Remember that good territory is made so by the zeal and effort of the worker. The territory where you are is just as good as you yourself make it, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">only keep at it consistently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Canvass</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most colporteurs find it unwise to use word-for-word the canvass of any one else; and we can see why this is so. The canvass reflects the personality, and that used successfully by some does not seem to fit other brethren. It is important that you “be yourself”. Use the main points of other brethren’s canvasses if you desire, but let your canvass be in your own words and come from your heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The opening remarks of calls are very important ones. If, when calling, you can make some remark that will engage the person’s attention, you are almost certain to be given a hearing. If, however, you have not proven yourself interesting in the first few remarks, people may feel themselves justified in slamming the door; some impolite people may actually slam the door in your face. But if your opening remarks are unique, you will, at least, hatfe left them something to think about. Probably their curiosity will be aroused, and they will not be so rude to the next caller.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The opening remarks that a great many successful colporteurs are using at the time of this writing, have reference to the radio broadcasting by Judge Rutherford. Most people have radios, and it is astounding how many people gladly receive colporteurs when tfie canvass is opened by referring to the Society’s work over the radio. Instances have been found where money was laid aside by listeners-in waiting for colporteurs to call. Here are a few samples of opening remarks:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Judge Rutherford has asked me to call on you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Did you hear Judge Rutherford’s last famous lecture over the radio ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. May I have just two minutes of your time? You probably have heard of the world’s greatest radio hook-up for Judge Rutherford. •</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">It may be that some current event or mention of some local problem will make interesting opening remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After gaining attention, the interest must be sustained. Much can be accomplished in developing interest if you are able to make the person you are addressing feel at ease. People feel that before a stranger they must demonstrate their breeding, manners, etc., consequently they are not natural. If through some word or act you can establish a friendly feeling, they are more likely to enter into what you are saying. Arguments and statements advanced coldly or stoically or as a matter of fact hardly contain the warmth of feeling that encourages friendliness. Hence, if your remarks encourage their entering into what you are saying, not to the extent of making comments, but by an affirmative nod of the head or “yes” or “no”, you can be certain that they are following you and listening to what you are saying and are not embarrassed in your presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Arguments that are direct and specific, and that tend to be conclusive, may seem almost rude to the persons you are addressing. The impression is left that what you have to say on the subject is the last word and that anything further is superfluous; whereas what you are saying, or rather the way you say what you have to say, should be in a way that encourages them to discover things for themselves. In this manner you are supplying subject-matter for their imagination and leaving it to them to reach the conclusion. Oftentimes when the prospect has not discovered anything himself, he feels that you have mentioned all the points, and that these points hardly warrant purchasing. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is well to make your remarks personal. Address the prospect by using personal pronouns such as “you,” “yours,” etc. By putting the person you are addressing into your remarks, you become interesting to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When talking, it is well to present new ideas rather than to mention old ideas and to show where they are wrong. In so doing you grant that the prospect holds the right idea, and he likes to think that your estimation of him is a high one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the first few weeks it will be well to watch the results of your canvass. Its effectiveness should be judged by the proportion of sales made to the number of persons who have heard your entire canvass, rather than by the number of calls. Meantime, experience will increase your ability, and greater results are assured. Watching these points during your first few weeks of service will tend to make you alert to the attitude of the people, and will acquaint you with the methods of meeting their viewpoint, which has much to do with your placing literature in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As well arranged as your canvass may be, it generally fails in effect unless it is suited to the person addressed. Experience will help you to be a judge of human nature, and thus to make your remarks individual. Fit your canvass to the person you are canvassing, remembering that business men will probably be more interested in world conditions; housewives are more likely to be interested in the price of food, loc^l troubles or the remedy for home difficulties; rich people will be glad to hear of a time of stability coming, as they do not like to hear about trouble; the poor will welcome anything proving that relief from oppression is coming soon; farmers will be glad to hear of farm relief ; those mourning for the dead will be interested in the kingdom message of resurrection; and almost everybody will rejoice to learn of the new government to be established that will bring righteousness and justice to all people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be brief as possible. Many colporteurs on entering the work made the mistake of making their canvasses too long. Don’t tell people all you know about the divine plan. Give them just enough to make them curious, so they will want the literature. Two or three minutes is plenty for the length of a canvass. You will learn after some experience just how to make an orderly arrangement of your points. Save your best point for the last, and make it a climax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If your call is to be a successful one, judged from the standpoint of making a sale or of delivering a witness, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font4"> will have to manage it. You know what you have to say. If attempts are made to inject comments along other lines of thought, such should be respectfully considered ; deal with them briefly, and then return to the point you were making when interrupted. Seldom will the interruption be repeated; for your method demonstrates that you have a certain mission and that you intend keeping to the object of your call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you are interrupted with a question, politely answer it as briefly as is consistent, and then return to the point where you were in the canvass. An interruption should be looked upon as an indication that you did not have the interest of the person entirely engaged. Hence take the hint, and support your canvass with more direct remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If, from the prospect’s remarks and actions, you find that he is ready to decide, attempt to close the sale. Remember that the decision once given is hard to reverse. If the prospect hesitates, present a point or two more. Do not give the prospect up too soon. Ofttimes a few more remarks will result in a sale. Forceful suggestions such as, “Keep this book and start your reading tonight” tend to incite action. This is better than, “Wouldn’t you like to have a copy?” It is also better than being arbitrary, as, “You owe it to yourself to have this book.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Necessity for re-canvassing people when you make delivery, is generally the result of reconsideration. They feel that they acted on the spur of the moment and without due reflection. As they think the matter over, the reasons for purchase do not seem so plausible, especially since you are not present to emphasize them. This sometimes happens when quick sale is made, and generally the book is not read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some steps to avert this can be taken by the worker in bringing to their attention in a sort of off-hand way how the book can be used, the various interesting subjects it treats, etc. For instance, single out Some scripture not generally understood and locate its explanation. In these examples do not disclose what the explanation is; rather- leave them looking forward to using the book in the manner you suggested to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">People like to be able to point out to their friends some good reasons for purchasing an article; and if workers can supply them with these reasons, they assure delivery. If orders are taken from several in the same vicinity, supply each with different or additional reasons where possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Meeting Objections</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the problems of which colporteurs write us is: How to demonstrate to the indivdual himself that he needs the books and that they are a necessary part of Ijis life. We know they need the books; but how can this be made to assert itself to the extent of purchasing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One way to accomplish this is to talk of the application of the books to today; the wealth of information they contain of world-wide happenings, their cause and reason; that the good things they speak of are not twenty, forty, or fifty years distant, but within their reach; how the information will aid in obtaining life and happiness. Then assume that the prospect is about to purchase, and picture his using the book a week from today in a comfortable chair and room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the matter is made tangible and within their comprehension, as contrasted with looking forward to life after death, which to them, in most cases, is forty to sixty years distant; and the matter of present importance is that of obtaining a livelihood and provisions for the immediate future. They are likely to have concluded that old age will provide ample time for looking into the life to come. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Probably, however, the most frequent excuse for not purchasing is “No money.” We asked one of our most successful colporteurs, who for years has worked in what is known as poor 'territory, how he meets the above objection; and here is his reply: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One must have and show a heart full of sympathy for every one who is poor or distressed. Quickly agree that the situation is bad; the outlook dark: that if man’s extremity is God’s opportunity, then surely that is what we have now come to; that if God does not do something for the common people, it is sure that the politicians, profiteers and preachers are not going to, and that that is just the reason why I am in the work I am in. God does have a remedy, and it is now time for the people to know about it. Be one of the common people yourself. Be so in earnest that they can’t help believing you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yes, I know it is mighty hard even to get things to eat. But Jesus said, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and then all these things” to eat and wear shall be added. The world is not suffering from spending a wee bit now and then for spiritual food; it is suffering because God has been pushed into the corner, and the people are seeking everything but the kingdom of God. God’s promise of the things to eat and wear is worth more than a bank account. For the bank may fail, but his promise will not. The message of God is far more important than</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">principle is that you get this whole library for only . . . . etc. I have found this to be the most effective knock-out blow to book agent prejudice and to the idea that I am after their money, that I have ever used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The dress, attitude and manners of the book agent or commercial salesman should nbt be copied by the colporteur who wishes to sell books in “no money” territory. My clothes bear silent testimony to the fact that I am a working man. I do not present a “prosperous” look. One poor old man living alone, but whose spirit of youth had not been broken and who was a “hard nut” to sell to because full of the Haldemann-Julius brand of infidelity, finally said: “Well, I see you are a working man like myself, and I will buy those books.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Where Are the Dead?</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom).</span><span class="font2"> Another, quite uninterested in the books, apparently, finally said: “Well, I see you are a man who has to make a living like the rest of us; I will take the books.” (Set of 3 and a booklet for $1.25) This more than paid for the gallon of oil he had served me for my motor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If they seem astonished at the price, say: “Well, you see you do not have to pay for the crease in my trousers, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">or the</span><span class="font2"> polish on my shoes and other expensive things which the book agent always carries around with him. I make no second trip around, and I do not pay any hotel bills. I could not do jt and sell books at this kind of price. We have a real message for the people and we carry the books with us and deliver as we go; you see what you get and you get what you see. We don’t want you to pay a cent for the message in those books; it is the gospel of good news and is free, absolutely! All you pay for is a part of the cost of materials and handling.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The truest, shortest, most effective and, therefore, best answer I have ever found to the question, “Is this Russellism?” is: “No indeed!” I then hasten to show them what it really is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If any colporteur who has difficulty in selling books to people who have “no money”, has any, even the slightest, qualms of conscience, or the slightest shadow of an idea that he is a profiteer in taking the poorest man’s last nickel for a book which it is now God’s will should be sold to the poor, I would suggest that he take twenty-four hours off, or as much longer as it is necessary, and shut himself up with a Bible and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> until he is completely convinced that a faithful witness for Jehovah God is not a profiteer when he is carrying out his high commission from the Creator! What if his profits amount to $10.00 a day or even more (mine were over $15.00 one day last week), does he use it for a selfish purpose? Is it really his money,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">something to eat; for Jesus said that “man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God”. And we see that that is true. We only die at last, even on the best bread and meat we can provide; if we get everlasting life, we must get it by every word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you were going to starve to death, then (here name the price of offer in h&amp;nd) will not keep you living more than another miserable meal or two. But the Lord does not say that you will starve to death because of spending a few cents for spiritual food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another reply:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You know that the children in these days do not have much chance to learn anything about God or the Bible at school; it is now mostly fairy tales and foolishness. If they are ever going to have a chance to learn anything worth while, it is certain that we will have to provide it here at home for them, for the Devil is not going to provide it for them away from home!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And another:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You know that most things we spend money for these days are soon gone, and often three weeks later you can not tell where the money has gone. « But here is a library which many years from now, when you have forgotten whether you spent four dollars for it or four hundred dollars, you will still have; and what is still better than that, you will have the message that they contain. And if one of your children should get half as much out of these books as my mother’s son did, he would rather have it when he is grown than all the wealth in ten miles of here—and that would be quite a bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For quick sale to “no money” prospects (early in canvass):</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now, of course you would expect the price of these books to be pretty high; the book agents, like everybody else, have to have a high price for their books, usually four or five or six dollars apiece; at that you see this set of ten books is worth at least $40.00 or $50.00. (Slight pause, and then very seriously and directly) But it so happens that I am not a book agent. I am a colporteur of the International Bible Students Association, and my work is to share these good things with the people. Jesus did not tell his disciples to go out and see how much money they could collect from the people; he said, “Freely ye have received, freely give.” The Christian is commissioned to go out and give something to the world; not to go and get something from the world. The result of applying this</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">in fact? I submit that the answer must be, No! If he does, he will be unfaithful and will not be in the Lord’s service long. The money which he receives, above the cost of the books, is a sacred trust delivered to him by our great Jehovah, which he must use to the very best of his ability to further the witness. He does this in the following ways: (1) By securing proper and nourishing food and rest for his own body; (2) by paying whatever other earthly obligations are upon him out of this God-given fund, so that he will not have to stop the service to engage in secular work; (3) by laying aside a little fund of a few hundred dollars to take care of emergencies as they arise, without having to stop the service temporarily every once in a while to look after outside obligations; (4) by putting all that is left over (and I have found this to be an exceedingly scant amount) into the tract fund, where it belongs and where it can do so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As an example of the hundreds of joys that come through following the above suggestions, I select one incident which I must relate: At Sears, a little sawmill town on a new railroad, I canvassed a lady in a wee shack, which she occupied because the Company was short of houses. She had a bright boy of about ten summers. Yes, she was interested. Just here “hubby” comes home from work. He is older than she; his hair is turning gray. Yes, he is very much interested. Yes, we would like to have the books, but “have no money&quot;. Hubby’s life Savings were wheedled away from him by the boom and by dishonest real estate sharks. Thinking that he had a competence for his wife and family, he now found himself penniless, and had to work hard, eleven hours a day handling big heavy, green timbers. For this work he did not get wages; he got a pittance; I have forgotten the amount. He had to get up at four or' four-thirty in the morning. At length they looked in the pocketbook and found the sum of 50c, which they decided to pay for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp Bible Study Course.</span><span class="font2"> Next morning I was held up at the railroad crossing by the logging switch eflgine. While annoyed at this delay, the lady from the little shack came running up all out of breath, having somehow secured a dollar bill, desiring me to let her have the other book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Deliverance). “Vie </span><span class="font2">sat up last night till ten o’clock reading that book, and my husband wants the other one, also,” she explained. “When it came ten o’clock I told him we’d have to lie down or he would not be able to work tomorrow.” I rejoiced to leave her a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> and a paper first volume for 50c. It is the people who are the hardest hit by the conditions who are the hungriest for the divine message of the kingdom which we have. To deny them the message of life because sentiment says they need bread worse than books; or to give away the books to them, and then have to quit the work ourselves because by our ungodly foolishness we are unable to make expenses, would surely be strange ways for a Christian to show his sympathy for the languishing meek of the earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I trust that in these suggestions you may find something which, in the Lord’s providences, may be of encouragement and assistance to some who are having difficulty with the “no money” plea, even though some of them may seem to some to be a little “rough shod”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">P. S. By the above suggestions, I do not mean to imply that I never give away a booklet, or that like Shylock I must exact the uttermost farthing. Probably I really give away more books, in fact, than many of those who boast of how they give them away. But I never give away a cloth bound book; and I never give awajf a booklet unless it is a case where they literally do not have any money or two eggs or so. If they have a nickel and want something else worse than our booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom,</span><span class="font2"> I do not give them the booklet. Of course there may be exceedingly rare exceptions to the above rules, which I make. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other objections successfully overcome are as follows: *</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I am a Catholic.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1) Repeat the word “Jubilee”; emphasize dates, 1914, etc., in the Bible; these books deal specially with mathematics of the Bible, not dealt with at all in Protestant, Catholic and Jewish religious doctrines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) Judge Rutherford is the only layman ever permitted to lecture in Lisbon, Madrid and Barcelona. On the occasion of his first visit to these’cities, his lecture was translated and published in the Catholic newspapers by order of the Catholic Deputy-Governor. Last year his lecture was broadcast over the government radio.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(3) I am sure the Catholics will be glad for the blessings of the Lord’s kingdom. Many Catholics purchase these books and like them. (If they say that the priest objects, suggest that they think for themselves; that the priest is human and is likely to make mistakes.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“I am a Christian Scientist.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1) These books explain Revelation, which Scientists study especially; Bible Students have been persecuted as have also Christian Scientists. ’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) You realize that much we have been taught is tradition and superstition; you are trying to get away from such things and find the truth. Judge Rutherford is encouraging this very effort of the people to think for themselves, exposing religious hypocrisy and the inconsistencies of the creeds. You will be glad to compare his lectures with what you have.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(3) These books point the way to everlasting life on earth; they explain Revelation, the most difficult book in the Bible to understand.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“Pentecostal” people.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1) These books uphold no man-made creed, and reference is made to the Bible alone.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) These books bring glad tidings; they treat the subject of baptism.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">No church.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1) Emphasize the war and profiteering; tell how Judge Rutherford was given an eightyyear sentence for telling what is in these books, in connection with the great secrets back of the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) These books are a complete expose of religious hypocrisy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Following are only a few of the canvasses used by our most successful colporteurs. They are given here merely to show that they are not much different, perhaps, from your own: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">f</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Canvass for Sets</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am representing Judge Rutherford, who lectures over WBBR. Have you a radio? Perhaps you have heard him lecture in Madison Square Garden? A man who can fill a place like Madison Square Garden has something of interest to tell the people. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now that the prophecies are being fulfilled, many are perplexed. They wonder why the nations are so desperately preparing for more war. They see a wave of crime and calamity sweeping over the world. Judge Rutherford in his latest book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font4"> answers all these questions with hundreds of Scriptures showing the cause and remedy. Isn’t it nice to know there is a remedy? We used to think that when the prophecies were due to be fulfilled that would mean the burning up of the earth. If that were so, then our prayer, “Thy Kingdom come,” would not be answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge Rutherford is recognized as the world’s greatest Bible lecturer, and yet he admits that he could not have understood the Bible if he had not used this method (produce booklet showing set). This series of seven volumes explains every subject from Genesis to Revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first book explains God’s plan for the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The second book explains the manner and object of our Lord’s return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The third book shows how the kingdom will operate in the earth for a thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fourth book shows and explains the prophecies due to be fulfilled before the kingdom is inaugurated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fifth book explains the difference between the soul and the spirit. Most people think that they are the same. That is why there is so much confusion as to what becomes of you when you die. It also explains the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sixth book tells about the different rewards, what the highest reward is and how you can get it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The seventh book explains all of Revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many think these books sell for $10.00 or $15.00. Judge Rutherford has put on a worldwide drive and during this drive you may get this series of 7 volumes and Judge Rutherford’s two books and three booklets for $3.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some like to make a deposit of $1.00, and we leave the combination of five books (showing combination) with you, and then when we bring the remaining seven you will have only $2.50 to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Canvass for Business Sections</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Ask for manager.) May I have just two minutes of your time? Thank you. You probably remember hearing about the great radio hookup given Judge Rutherford last July by the National Broadcasting Company. By means of this hookup of fifty-three stations, Judge Rutherford’s lecture, “Freedom for the People,” reached many parts of the world. The response in the way of telegrams and letters was the greatest ever received by WEAF and WJZ. Now, more than 100 radio stations are regularly broadcasting Judge Rutherford’s lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a business man and a thinking man, you realize the world is facing a great crisis. Notwithstanding the giant organizations and the repeated efforts to establish a League of Nations, also the efforts of a few great men to better conditions, almost every one doubts that the world can be stabilized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is interesting to know that this condition of things is a fulfilment of Bible prophecy. Judge Rutherford’s interpretations of prophecy are attracting world-wide attention. In fact, the demand for his interpretations is so great that they are being printed in book form at the rate of 12,000 a day. The printing of his books in such large numbers makes it possible for him to publish them for the nominal price of $1.18 for the combination of three books.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">ing, a resident of your district (if true). I have a program for you from radio station KFWM. You have a radio? (If prospect says, “No.”) Then you have not had the privilege of hearing the wonderful lectures concerning the golden age now dawning. For the convenience of those who<sup>J</sup> have not had this opportunity, I always carry a few of the lectures in printed form with me. (If prospect has answered, “Yes,” to the question, Have you a radio? say) For the convenience of those who are hearing and appreciating these lectures, I always carry a few in printed form. (Here show </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.)</span><span class="font4"> Judge Rutherford, who is the author of this book, helped to establish the station, and lectures free, without collection, in all parts of the world. His books are always sold at the cost of printing. This one is 38c. (Explain picture on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font4"> and read first paragraph of book.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) Good morning! I represent Judge Rutherford, manager of broadcasting stations KFWM, WBBR and many others throughout the earth. We are broadcasting a wonderful message of comfort to the people. We are pointing the people to the Bible prophecies that are now in the course of fulfilment; for example, the world’s great war, the Jewish people now returning to Palestine, and all our inventions, such as the railroad train, airplane, radio, and all our institutions of learning. The Bible shows that when the human race would live to see these things, this would mark the beginning of the establishment of Christ’s kingdom upon this earth. On the other hand, our great statesmen from every nation tell us that we are preparing for war on a greater scale than for that of 1914. The Bible foretells this same condition, and shows positively that all unrighteous organizations will be completely destroyed in this trouble that now threatens the earth. This volume explains the things I have briefly told you about, and shows how we might escape this great time of trouble, and how the people of earth will soon receive the blessing of peace, prosperity, life, liberty, health and happiness. The 38 cents you will pay for this volume goes to print another for some one else. I should be glad to leave one now in your home, and I am sure that your heart will rejoice in every page that you read.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(3) Good morning! I have a program for you. Have you a radio? (Show program.) Did you ever listen to KFWM? Judge Rutherford is the president of the Oakland Educational Society. No doubt you have heard him lecture. (Here give a chance to remark. Most people profess to know little or nothing about him. Then I continue.) Well, he is a man who travels all over the world, through all European countries, is very much interested in Palestine. He meets with all the physical conditions of the world which give evidence to Bible prophecies being fulfilled before our eyes. His lectures are on physical facts and Bible prophecies. Thousands go to hear him. His latest lecture, Deliverance for the People, is a masterpiece ; it takes you back over a period of sixty centuries; traces the controversy between God and Satan; explains the cause of wars, famines and all disasters; shows how the people of the earth will be delivered from the oppressor, and will enjoy endless happiness. This lecture is in great demand, and can now be obtained at printing cost, 38 cents. (Here show the book.) We sold 50,000 copies the first week. I assure you we are not out for money, but to serve you with the blessings God has in store for you. Judge Rutherford’s object is to make these books plain and clear-cut for the busy person. He spends his time and money laying down his life for humanity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(4) Good morning! If you have a radio, no doubt you have heard some of Judge Rutherford’s lectures. I have the pleasure of representing Judge Rutherford. Some of his latest lectures have been published in this volume entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font4"> in which he gives the evidence that we are entering the age of justice for the people. His work is not a bit ecclesiastical, yet he gives Bible evidence in support of his statements. The publishers intend that this book shall be a message of encouragement for the people, so they are selling it for 38 cents. I should like to leave a copy with you. You will get information as well as encouragement from reading it yourself, and then you will want to pass it on to others to enjoy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Combination Canvass &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sunday morning introduction: Good morning! I am spending a little time this morning in Christian work, calling attention to Judge Rutherford’s wonderful lectures on Bible topics. No doubt, etc. (Balance same as below.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regular introduction: Good morning! I represent Judge Rutherford, one of the best known broadcasters in the country. No doubt you have heard some of his lectures over the Watch Tower Station WBBR, Staten Island, New York, or some other of the 112 stations that are carrying his messages at this time. In his home city of Los Angeles they think so much of him that on one occasion 35,000 people came out at the Stadium there to hear him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of his lectures are to be had now in permanent form. In this one, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity Sure, </span><span class="font4">the Judge shows how that shortly, with the establishment of the Lord’s kingdom, man will get his heart’s desire: life, liberty, peace, prosperity, health and happiness. (While speaking open book in middle, upside down, so as to show entire cover.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These lectures are sold in combinations. In the second one, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Last Days,</span><span class="font4"> the Judge makes a study of present-day conditions in the earth, in the light of the prophecies being fulfilled before our eyes, and shows why all the property in the country is gravitating into the hands of a few. (Ditto as to cover.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The third is a study on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead? </span><span class="font4">and attracted extraordinary interest when it was given in New York recently. (Ditto as to cover.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fourth, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font4"> is a study of the ten most important doctrines in the Bible, from Creation to the Times of Restoration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fifth, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font4"> is a study of the divine plan in story form, with Jesus as the hero of the great drama of the ages, one of the most thrilling, inspiring and comforting messages ever given in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sixth and last, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font4"> is brand new, a harmonization of science and the Bible, beautifully illustrated with some choice scenes from the finest picture galleries of the old world. (While speaking this paragraph and the following, hold book upside down, so customer can plainly see, and leaf quickly over all illustrations, first the frontispiece, then pages 101 to 108, then pages 204 to 212, and then pages 277 to 283, stopping there with book open at the. double pictures there shown.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I think you will be interested and surprised when I tell you that any two of these booklets and any two of the bound books can be had in this form for only one dollar. The books are not sold for profit, but for the blessing that they are in the hands of the people. I am leaving the books as I go along, and would like to leave a set with you. Any two of the booklets and any two of the books for only one dollar, or, if you wish them all, you can have the entire six for only one fifty. (If you made a sale next door be sure to say so at this point.) I am sure that if you get the books and read them you will say that this is the best investment of a small sum of money that you ever made in your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following is the canvass and other interesting information received from two very successful colporteur brethren. They have, by the Lord’s blessing, by their faith in the divine plan and loyal devotion to the Lord and by their regularity and persistency in the work, been able to earn considerably more than most brethren make who work for the Devil’s organization. One of them recently purchased a new automobile to use in the service. During the past twelve weeks one has averaged sales of 87 one-dollar combinations each week, while the other’s average has been 48 one-dollar combinations weekly. Their advice to all is, “Plug away as though you really mean business.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Thus the Scriptures definitely identify Jesus as the great Deliverer of the human race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">terested in. What we are doing is calling on the people to try to help them get a little more interested in their Bibles, and help them to find the answers to many of their difficult Bible questions. That is something that our country is in need of, don’t you think?” Here get out your card. (The card referred to is hereinafter reproduced. We are prepared to furnish these at $1.50 a thousand. Classes desiring to have them with printing different from that shown, will pay $2.00 a thousand.) “Now what we have arranged here is over 1,500 questions, giving the answers and always showing just where to find them in the Bible.” Read the following questions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“What is the sin against the holy ghost?” “Who was Cain’s wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Where are the automobile, radio and airships foretold in the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Who has the keys of hell ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Will all in their graves live again ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now put . away your card and get your books; you can say while doing this: “I want to show you how easily you can find the answers to these questions. Now the one here, “Who has the keys of hell?” Turn to page 170, in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> and read: “I am He that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore and have the keys of hell and death.—Rev. 1:18.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Will all in their graves live again?” Turn to page 310 in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance:</span><span class="font4"> “Marvel not at this for all that are in their graves shall hear his voice and come forth.—John 5 :28, 29.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now answer from card-: “Cain married his own sister.—Genesis 3 :20.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Nahum foretold the automobiles; Isaiah, the airships; Job, the radio; and the Lord said these would be some of the signs of his kingdom. We can surely see them today, can’t we ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In regard to the other books you have with you, just say a few words about each one. Just to give you an idea we will use </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord’s Return, Where Are the Dead? Prosperity Sure</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span><span class="font4"> Now referring to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord’s Return: </span><span class="font4">“This one gives the prophecy the Lord said would be in fulfilment during the time of his second coming.” Next the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dead:</span><span class="font4"> “This one is on the resurrection of the dead.” Now </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity</span><span class="font4">: “This is one which should interest all of us, Prosperity sure; but we are not going to get it from any selfish man; rather under the Lord’s reign.” Now use </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font4">: “This one is on the creation' of the earth and all it contains.” Now you turn to some of the pictures and say: “This book is beautifully illustrated with copies of world-famed masterpieces.” Turn to page 102, show them the earth and the heavens in formation. Next turn to page 105 and show them Adam and Eve in their beautiful home which they lost by their disobedience. Then turn to page 107. Show them the glacier age, and tell them this no doubt caused many of the hills and mountains we have in this country. Now turn to page 209. Show them the crucifixion. Tell them: “ This is the way they repaid the Lord for healing the sick and raising the dead, and the many other good things he did while in earth the first time. This was a great way of repaying him. I don’t doubt if they could get hold of him now they would treat him worse. Don’t you think so?” Now tell them the price of the books and offer them, but don’t let them say, No. Begin your canvass on the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance </span><span class="font4">book again. Make your canvass mostly on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span><span class="font4"> You don’t need to say anything about the other books now. Only at the end of each canvass you spread them out in your hand like a fan and say, “You get all these books for (name the price).” Now show the contents in the front of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> book, explaining that it shows God’s dealings with mankind from creation to restoration. Explain that it is not merely a question book, but can be read just the same as any book and in connection with that there are over 1,500 questions, alphabetically arranged in the back. Always be sure to show them what you are talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here offer them the books again and state the price and tell them how helpful they will be in their Bible studies, also tell them how many you are selling to their neighbors. Try to get them to buy, but don’t let them say, No. Watch their lips, also their hands; and if they don’t show signs of buying, start to canvass again, using the questions: “What is the cause of so many different languages in the world today?” Turn to page 53 in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> and read: “Therefore is the name.of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth.—Genesis 11:5-9.” Now try again to get them to l?uy. If they don’t buy yet, show them another question or two; then try to close the sale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If they simply won’t buy, look for some one else. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Don’t spend too much time with any one, and don’t preach—sell books.</span><span class="font4"> If you want to preach, rent a hall. It is well, before starting out, to make combinations of your books and always keep them in order so you can handle them without trouble and know what you are talking about when you call on people. Always talk about things they understand. Remember what you knew before you got the truth. Don’t ever try to show any one that you know more than they. No one likes that. Always try to show them how much the books will help them to find in a jiffy the things they do know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Always keep your books hidden until you get their interest with the card. No one likes a book agent. Show them that the International People are the publishers. Don’t add anything more. Don’t try to tell them about every one that has ever been connected with the work. Talk about how handy the books are for one’s Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A good selling point in the South or when you are not canvassing Catholics, is to say: “Now you don’t need to be afraid of getting any Catholicism in your home.” Turn to page 208 in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> and show what it says about the Pope being the representative of the Devil. This sells many books for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every one that has used this canvass has made good with it. It is mailed to you with the hope that it will help others. One can use any books he likes and as many as he wishes to sell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">AND NOW</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In conclusion, dear brethren, we want to repeat that the Lord’s blessing, your own devotion to the Lord and faith in the divine plan, and your honest loyal efforts in the colporteur field, are bound to produce success and continuance in the work. Remember, you are ambassadors of Jehovah God. Fear no man. You have what every person on earth would give all he possesses for, if he only knew. Being president of the country or king or controlling the largest of the world’s industries would be like running a peanut stand, in comparison with your privilege of representing the great Creator of the universe. You have wisely chosen, dear brethren, to make loyal devoted service to the Lord your big business in life, and in this we rejoice. We want you to feel and know that we are with you at all times, whether you abound or whether you are abased, as Paul puts it. Do not give up: that would be exactly wHat the adversary desires. Write us; maybe we can make some suggestions that will help you. Study </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> as it comes to you. Refresh your memory by reading the books. Pray often, and we know the Lord will bless and assist you. We bear you up before the throne of heavenly grace every day. God bless the colporteurs!</span></p>

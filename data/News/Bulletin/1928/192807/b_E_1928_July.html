<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Cursed be- he that dca^h the. ■work of Jehovah neglige.-ifk;; and cursed be he ihaf tceepeth back his sword from blood.”—Jerer.iUdit J<sub>f</sub>S: !O, li.</span><span class="font1"> I<sup>7</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">t</span><span class="font1">TYOUYSTIOYAIJLY Moab hers rep-J resents a portion of the Devil’s or' ganization, and those who firs cursed or reprlsnaudeci are the cues who are lying down o'l 1 ■ job so ter as the service work is concerned. There can be no question ir. the minds of those who kve the Lodi supremciy aud wlvo study </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font1"> as to the absolute necessity for them to participate in the field service if they would please the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Orc might talk about loving the Lord, until his tongue became paralyzed by the talking and not interest. Jehovah any more than the tinkling of a cymbal. “If ye love me. keep my commandments’’; and the express commandment from the Lord for the members of the church at this time is to witness to his great name by declaring the day of his vengeance. To be other than active in the service now, in our judgment, would be ‘keeping back the sword from blood’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ‘word” her? mentioned refers to the r-sfsuge of truth, that Jehovah has placed in the hands of the fully devoted servants with which to. perform tie witness work he has designed. The faithful ones will keep their swords bathed m blood; that is, they will place Ged’s message in the hands of the people so that it will do the slaying work ha desn'cs done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The time is here for the people to know about tlie impending destruction, of that wickedly malignant dev.il organization that for thousands of years has been grinding them dow’i into oppression and death. You have the sword, brethren. Do what you have covenanted with, the Lord to do. Let’s be “hot”. The following portion of this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font1">informs us how the Lord has very graciously provided us all with a brand-new sharp sword. Let’s use it vigorously.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>METHODS OF WORK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font1"> brings the people a message of the times. The book presents the promises Jehovah has made for the reconciliation of man and his? restoration to the perfection lost. This is the? nisnn theme of the book; am’ presenting the promises in the conclusive way that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font1"> does Is what makes the book a message of the hour, for it speaks out as a witness and raises a standard against the present maze of writings that seek to refute the Bible’s teachings and make its promises of no effect</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The campaign with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font1"> should begin Immediately. Details of operation have been outlined in the “Directors' Bulletin”, We urge workers to talk in terms of books. With 7teco»-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cUiutio-n</span><span class="font1"> an excellent offer can be made to the people of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance,, Creation</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation, Lent Daj/8, Prosperity Sure, </span><span class="font1">Klien? arc </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the Dent:.? Hell,</span><span class="font1"> nil for Sl.08. People appreciate book values. We urge all workers to frame their canvasses so as to present to the people the $1.08 combination. There are millions of books sold each year. The people appreciate a good value in a book offer as much ns they do in any other line, and four volumes at $1.98 is an excellent offer, containing, as the books do, reproductions of world-famed artists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The reproductions appearing in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font1"> with the exception of one reproduction in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font1"> can not be even seen in any of the museums of the United States, and if people wished to purchase the prints individually they alone would cost them thirty-live cents apiece, or $11.20 for the reproductions appearing in tlic two books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Then again, the later editions of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font1"> have the same stamping and binding as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation'</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span><span class="font1"> Thus the books are seen to be related as making up a set. They are all stamped in gold and bound in the new light shade colors so much in demand at the present time. People will appreciate this vulue if It is presented to them in such a. way that they can see the great saving in value in the offer. This, of course, requires that the worker help them to appreciate the book value. People may be told of the message. The canvass at the door may give them a short and excellent insight into the work of the Watch Tower, but the message is in the books and the message will be delivered when the books are in tl-e homes of the people. They will come to appreciate the message only as if. is available for use.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Study Previous Sales</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">In some portions of the territory the houses have been thoroughly worked with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Rarp.</span><span class="font1"> Of course, it is impossible to sell these people the same book, and it is to the advantage of the worker that they be not reminded that they have the bocks and have not read them. Cooperate with the director in studying past sales in all parts of the territory, and in such territory offer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font1"> and one booklet at 98c. In homes that have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font1"> offer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font1"> and three booklets at 75c. If this offer does not appeal to them, then offer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Recondliation</span><span class="font1"> at 45c. If there is not interest in any of the offers above mentioned, then endeavor to place the t.wo booklets at 2(ic, or one booklet at j.Oc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Difficult territory is to he found in every class assigmrCTt. Some territory is acitiul’y diillcult, and other territory is viewed as difficult by the workers; but it is well for each worker to remember that his responsibility is in letting the people decide whether they will accept the message. and that it is not for the worker to decide whether he should or should not xrresent the message to people in different sections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Oftentimes outward appearance is merely a polish or mask which people will discard when they find that you come to them with a genuine desire to assist. Note Hie following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I have noticed that where opposition to entering a territory is strongest the message Is most appreciated ami there the people are most apt to buy and do. So wherever we sec the Devil's “Keep Out” signs, we just smile and walk in, end come out smiling, too! Most any old path through Ilie woods leads to some poor soul who is hungering for the Lord’s message. Ant anticipating great joy In putting the Lord’s latest book. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation,</span><span class="font1"> in the people's hands. 1 have not yet received mine, but expect to find, it waiting at the post office here in the morning. Most of the streets in this town look like duplicates of Easy Street, and, from the number of churches, the Devil bas them almost all converted ; but there will be many roads and one or two small towns with those who will, no doubt, be glad to hear.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Don’t Stop Too Soon</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The following letters tend to Indicate that there is much room for progress in demonstrating to the people that the books you are offering are cf much value and that in reality it is necessary to accommodate the circumstances to ■ the conditions. When people do not appreciate the value that the books present, they try to be courteous enough not to say that the books are not worth anything to them. There are different ways of saying this, and the phrase, “We have no money,” seems to be the most generally used. How many workers drop the argument at this place it is impossible to say, but the following is one of the letters that indicate that people use this as an excuse for not purchasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“A sister had an amusing experience recently while canvassing one of the small towns. A lady told her she had no money. In a short while the sister passed by the same house again and the lady called her in and told her that she </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">did</span><span class="font1"> have some money in the house and that she felt so bad about telling her that she did not that when she tried to eat her dinner it just choked her. So she bought the books.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mus W. L. Tayixxr—-.</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Springfield, III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Whenever a worker shows that he is sufficiently interested in people’s welfare to accommodate himself to their circumstances either by taking an order and making the delivery later after pay-day or. as in rural districts, by taklrg some produce in exchange for books, then the people come to appreciate that you are interested in something more tlinn in making your commission or Just distributing books; and when they can see that a worker is in the work because of his heart-interest, they take an altogether different viewpoint of what is being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I tried out the rural districts last week without working In business districts. I did not try to sell tt:s books for cash. After passing the time of day I would quickly toll them that T was not a book agent and was not after any money, saying, “I have the International Studies you can get without any money,” Then when I noticed that they wanted the books I told, tliein the books were worth fifty dollars, but that they could have the nine books by giving me hens that arc not leghorns. If they do not want me nine, I take two hens for the $1.18 set. Nine out of ten last week would not pay ;:cy utvitey, but would give chickens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">‘'After jny books were raid for last week I Inui $04.00 left, whereas if I had not taken cbtekciis 1 would have had less than $20.00, as ttii-y htul not hud any rain out here till this v, wk and were much discouraged. I believe ;toir inert. ot my work from now on will be in tilt* r l i S ■ cl! i ?; S t r i (! ts.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Be Firm for the Truth</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Disposition is waning. This is one of the tilings most manifest in the field today. But again it requires that the worker take the initiative, for how else will opposition be answered? Av:l geiieraliy those who oppose the work or manifest opposition to what you are doing know eriongh tilmut the work that if they are set right will purchase the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“We are greatly rejoicing over the fact of entering the Lord’s work at this time. It is munge Indeed to note, as we go about, that people who are prejudiced at first change their minds soon after you talk to them. Sister----</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;01; one occasion met a gentleman who would not say anything good for Brother Russell and mentioned that the doctrine of Pastor Russell was not tit for any one to read, but before she left he purchased five of the books which included </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span><span class="font1"> He said that if what she said was in the books was true he knew he would like them. This shows that the prejudice is breaking down, and that soon the people will know who the true and living God is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I believe I am learning to canvass the right way, and that is to know just what you are going to say and say it in your own words. That will bring results. We found this out In a very short while. I wish to state that during the past two weeks in the auxiliary colporteur work I have placed more books in the hands of the people, canvassing from house, to house, than I had during the last two years or more.” George B. Mabsh—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zanesville, Ohio,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Oppo rtunities</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Opportunities abound: and what opportunities are placed in the path of the worker, even though to him the occasion may seem an unimportant one, it is best to enter upon the opportunity that presents itself with that zest and enthusiasm that will bring results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I was canvassing a family, and the wife and mother suggested that I </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">so</span><span class="font1"> to the meeting of the Ivtoie.q Aid. I declined, However, after about a half-hour’s work, I ran into the Ladies Aid meeting-place, mid being invited to come in after I bad sis’.ted my mission, introducing myself as a Christian Bible student, representing the International Bible Students Association w'ho arc broadcasting over the powerful radio the glad message of Deliverance and Freedom for the Peoples, I went in and proceeded io »eii them of the evidence we have of ihe incoming of God’s glorious kingdom of peace. While doing so I canvassed them for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp. tMirw-ance, Creation</span><span class="font1"> and the seven volumes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ot Sfudfes In the Scriptures.</span><span class="font1"> and suggested that the ladles Ato order a complete set of ten for tbeir library at $3.35. There were about twenty women present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“They replied that they vrore financially unable to order the bound volumes. I then took five booklets in my lunnl sjto, utter describing each title hrielly, I uiw from my clmir and started around to each one with them, and after one woman Into taken rhe lead by picking out </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Where are the iK-atl ‘</span><span class="font1"> others followed with sets of tinte mui five, line wo-an-i even arose from l,e? &lt;-huiv and, going ;&lt;&gt; my carrying case before 1 to lirr, picked orit a set of three. 1'liist helped w&lt;q:dert«:l.v s-tid gave the witness quite </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> boost.

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Overlook None</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Even so-called impossible places tire not i-n-possible, for agencies are at work that workers are not aware of and, in fact, that the Society is not aware of. The Lord is the great Captain on the bridge of the ship. We who are assigned to different places do not know, nor do we see, all that the Lord is accomplishing; but when we are placed at a designated point and are given our work, then we should act in the capacity that the Lord has designated; and the worker will always find that, his mission is a greater and larger one than he anticipated or realized. The following letter emphasizes this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“In my canvassing last week I came to a small sanitarium. There were mostly old ladies. At first I thought I would not go there. Then I knew it would not be right to miss any one. Of course I know now who it wm that pm the thought in uij rtond not to go there. I thank God that my love and zeal for the Lord is stronger than that evil one. I rang the bell, and the lady in charge came to the door, I started giving my canvass. I got only as far as Totor-jitoiomil Bible Students* when she said, ‘Come rigiit in, my dear. Every door should be open to I. it. £?.. A. I always bring in WBBR and also our own VC1CG station.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Sho has radios in dilTerent rooms so placed that all the old todies can hear Brother Rutherford Sunday morning, and now she will let them listen to our own local station every Monday night from eight co nine p-m, She said, ‘They get </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">w&gt;</span><span class="font1"> much comfort from it-’ She took Oreo-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tkni, Deliverance</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp.&quot;</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Territory Improves as Worked</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">An the worker progresses it becomes more and more manifest that each time the territory is gone over there is a greater number of people left who have not bought but who have determined that they wifi buy at rhe next opportunity. Workers should consider the field assigned to them as never completely worked until the message is in as many homos as it is possible to place it, and that each new message, such as the bock ffcscnciNdtf&amp;a. but offers 1.0 all the people the further opportunity of obtaining the bocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">•‘Since the first of the year I have canvassed Clintonville anti Shawano for the seventh time. Placed about four hundred books in each of these towns. I could have placed more if the people had had the means to buy. It Is surprising how many people are beginning to think. It was impossible to limit my time at a call as I do tn virgin territory. Many of the people are htwwRing our friend.s, even among the Catholics. Tliey are asking many interesting questions in regard to the truth and the Bible Students’ work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“It is wonderful to watch God’s overruling power as we go on stop by step. We had to postpone our trip last Sunday. In the afternoon Brother drove while I canvassed in the rural district and placed forty books. The Sunday before I placed seventy-two, among them nineteen bound books. It is marvelous how the fanners buy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Then, too, remember that the people who have bought the books are reading them, talking about them and ieliing their friends and neighbors about them; mid since they depend upon the worker to come </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tn</span><span class="font1"> them with a now message they do not send the people t&lt;&gt; the homes for the message. It devolves upon the worker to come to them, and it is the responsibility that the Lord has placed upon them to bring the message to the people, knowing that his work will be prospered by and through the different conditions that the field contributes toward placing the books in the hands of the people.

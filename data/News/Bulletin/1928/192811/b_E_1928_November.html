<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>The Battle-Cry of the Anointed</span><br><br><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Felt In Concerted Attack</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The slogan, “The sword of the Lord and of his anointed,” adopted at the Detroit (Mich.) convention, has taken like wild-fire, and has become the battle-cry of the anointed. This particularly directs our attention to the final charge of Gideon's band and associates it with the present campaign. The picture is undoubtedly set forth as an exhibition of complete devotion and loyalty to the Lord and his cause and of whole-hearted cooperation in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That a similar condition of understanding and cooperation might exist in the Lord’s army now, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> is going to contain all instructions and information regarding service matters, and the “Letter of Instructions to Directors” will be discontinued. The service committee is to consider the plan of action and submit it to the workers as heretofore, basing this plan upon the suggestions and recommendations in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin; </span><span class="font1">but, that the workers may in turn intelligently consider these plans and suggest ways and means of more effectively carrying them out, the complete procedure will be outlined in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font1"> which will go to the workers and service committee alike, so that all will be acquainted with the campaigns therein recommended and can intelligently cooperate in carrying them to a successful conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The respective divisions of the Lord’s army that directly contribute to the great witness now being given are the colporteurs, the class organizations, the production of books, and the radio. That all these divisions may cooperate with unity and understanding, a section of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> will be devoted</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Early Reports of the Two-Week Drive Indicate It to Be a Big Success</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Sunday, October 21, began what promises to be the most successful drive yet inaugurated. The spirit of the issue, <sup>&lt;!</sup> Jehovah, the peoples’ Friend,” has taken hold of the friends everywhere, impelling them to make this issue the biggest thing on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was only a little while ago that we were at the Detroit convention and heard Brother Rutherford deliver the most powerful lecture ever given for Jehovah and against Satan. However, this blessed privilege was not restricted to those who happened to be able to go to the convention. Thousands of the anointed in this country, Canada, Honolulu, Australia and the Isles of the Sea were thrilled by the same message also. And, in addition to these, millions of radio listeners heard it and were encouraged to hope for better things. You are privileged to help them realize this hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On October 21 thousands of the Lord’s anointed went forth with this message in printed form, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend,</span><span class="font1"> determined to make this the greatest issue now before the people. The early reports coming to the office indicate that the Lord has richly blessed your efforts. The message of the hour will be given in a large portion of the field, and the Lord has permitted us to have a part in it. Many have gone into the field who have not regularly participated in the witness work. Our aim should be to stay in the service from this time forth. There is not a greater or better business on earth, regardless of what you may be engaged in. If you really want to make this business your business, take it to the Lord and watch for his leading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Immediately after this campaign another ■micrhfv &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hninrp n-nT'oncrorl -Pr\v» &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+rx commence November 5 and to continue until January 1, 1929. The object of this drive is to get the best results from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font1"> campaign and place in the hands of the people the complete outline of the Lord’s provision for befriending them at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Much of the effect of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font1"> booklet campaign last year was lost, due to the fact that most of the territory was not recanvassed for the other literature until from six to ten months after the drive. By that time the interest created by the booklet had considerably diminished, and in many cases its effect was lost entirely. Therefore, to forestall a recurrence of this condition, arrangements were made for the above campaign. Beginning November 5, every director is to call off the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font1"> drive for the present and arrange to have the territory which has been canvassed with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font1"> recanvassed with the five-volume combination for $1.98. Some idea of the effect </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font1"> will have upon the people is shown by the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You mailed to me, on September 22, names of three parties who live in our assignment, and herewith I am giving report. These names were submitted on account of commendation of lecture, “Ruler for the People.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No. 1. County Superintendent of Sunday schools of Christian Church; much interested; wants all the literature later, to be delivered to him on September 23; five-book combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No. 2. Much interested; purchased five-book combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No. 3. Was very glad to hear the lecture, and also to receive the copy. Could not take the books at this time, but will take them later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Similar expressions of appreciation have been received from all parts of the country, which indicates that many of the people realize their need of further information regarding this issue. What was true of those who heard the lecture and read it in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> will also be true of those who receive their copy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font1"> at home and read it. They will be just as anxious to know more about this issue. Our anointing by the Lord obligates us to carry this message to those who are in need of it. Therefore every service committee should arrange to reassign to the workers the same territory they had during the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend </span><span class="font1">drive. Each worker should make a careful analysis of his assignment and approach the people from the most favorable standpoint. Their experience of previously canvassing them for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font1"> will have equipped them to do this effectively. One brother takes advantage of the “bigotry” issue, now prevalent throughout the country, to place </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font1"> in many homes. The same can be done with other books. After introducing himself and his work, he says, “This is a broad-minded non-sectarian work which proves that bigotry is of the Devil. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The facts indicate that the people will be ready for the message contained in the combination. Therefore, as pictured in Gideon’s band, let every one press on in the great battle, and, when the time comes to switch the method of attack, let no one be negligent or self-willed, desiring to carry out personal preferences or desires; but rather let the whole class as a unit drop the booklet campaign immediately and take up the boundvolume drive which commences November 5. This offering as nearly as possible the same combination by every class from Maine to California will create a tremendous witness throughout the country. Going forward in battle array with one attack after another upon the enemy’s organization will undoubtedly do a great deal more than if each individual or each ecclesia were to follow </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">haphazard course and do what they prefer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Make the $1.98 combination the general offer to the people. Stick to it until you are sure it can not be placed. Do not drop too soon to a smaller combination. However, after you are convinced that the larger combination can not be placed, you will, of course, reduce your offer according to your judgment of what the prospect is able or willing to purchase. The main point is to stick to your original offer and keep your combination complete as far as possible. We believe that with the interest created by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font1"> the people will take the combination if they think it is a set covering the entire issue. If conditions in your territory have been adverse and the majority of the people are hard-pressed for money, then the three new books may be offered for $1.28, or two of the new books and a booklet for $1.00; but push whatever combination is first presented by sticking to it until you are quite convinced that it can not be sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Study your territory. Discuss it at the workers’ meeting. Decide at the workers’ meeting what the territory will hold, with due consideration, of course, of the interest created by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font1"> campaign, and then go forward as a unit, each worker presenting the combination in the various sections of the class territory that has been decided upon at the workers’ meeting. For illustration, if it has been decided that Sections 4 and 6 of your territory will take (Continued on page 4, column 1)</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Pioneers to Stage Final Drive in Rurals</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>1100 Expected to Participate</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">November is here. Snow will soon come in the North and roads may not be so good in the South. So, all ye pioneers, let’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">make </span><span class="font1">hay while the sun shines and put in the good days of the coming month in canvassing the rural districts. Out of 1140 regulars, don’t you think there ought to be at least 1100 who could do this ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The farmers are really hungry for the message; and even though you can’t make quite so many calls, judging from the experience of those working rural territory, you will average more sales in proportion to the number of calls made than in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One brother sends us this report for rural districts in a county in South Dakota which has, including the towns, an average of only 14.3 persons per square mile. Without canvassing any of the towns this brother was able to place 1668 cloth-bound books and 786 booklets. We think that’s pretty good; and surely it shows the possibilities in the rural work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now is the time to call on the farmers. They are just finishing the harvesting of their crops and should have some money with which to buy the books. They have been suffering much oppression and hardship in most places and are looking for some remedy. Why not give them something good to read during the coming winter months when they spend time reading the mail-order-house catalogues?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let’s go, pioneers. What do you say? Can’t we make November the biggest month so far for canvassing rural territory ?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Frail Sister Canvasses Rurals</span><br><br><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Without Car</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Sister Otis Bowman has found a most interesting and effective way for canvassing the rural districts without an automobile. By using the mails to forward her books to her she has been able to cover all of the territory thoroughly and finds that she can place more books than when she used an automobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is how she does it. First, by consulting a U. S. rural-route and post-office map, she figures up the number of calls to be made between each of the post offices along the route. Then she estimates the number of books it will take to work the territory between these points. The books are wrapped in separate packages, stamped and addressed to herself in care of the various post offices along the route. The packages are left with her landlady, or some friendly person, to be mailed to her at such times as will make certain their reaching the post office ahead of her arrival, so that when she gets there the books will be on hand. Full instructions for mailing are left with each package. Then she starts out on foot with sufficient books to last her until she reaches the first post office. She also carries in her bag a few changes of light clothing to last her for the week or two she will be on the road. By the time she reaches each post office her stock of books is depleted and she is ready to pick up the new supply. Without carrying </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">heavy load of books at any time, and for </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">few cents postage, she has been able to cover her territory with fine success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although frail in appearance, she writes, &quot;I can usually canvass two post offices and the territory between in one day. You will be surprised how with an early start in the morning you can canvass for six miles. When evening comes I begin to look around for a place to stay. I notice the environment of the house and when I find a kindly disposed housewife who considers my books favorably and hesitates on account of the money, I suggest that she exchange a night’s lodging for my books. I have not had any difficulty in getting accommodations. I give three books for the night’s lodging, supper and breakfast, and another book for my dinner. After two months of this work I could see that this method had not tired me physically. It is just the opposite. It has increased my physical strength, endurance and vitality, and I have all joy in the work. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">She says that she has cleared more above her expenses by this method than in any other way and that it has the advantage over other methods in that one is always right on the territory, ready to begin. No running to and fro is necessary.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Sell Books in Spite of “No Money”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Two colporteurs have sent us a list of sixty-four articles which they have taken in exchange for books in cases where the buyer has plead “No money”. It reads like the inventory of a country store. Chickens, eggs and vegetables are taken by many colporteurs to a good advantage; but these two have taken articles which begin with almost every letter in the alphabet, ranging from dill pickles to dresses, under letter D; from mittens to mulberries, under M; and from turnips to tooth brushes, under the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">T’s. </span><span class="font1">They haven’t even slighted the V’s, for there we find vanishing cream listed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where there’s a will there’s a way. Especially is this true when that will is the Father’s will and when one is in earnest about this kingdom business. Does the Lord fulfil his promises to provide the necessary things of life for those who seek first the kingdom? Ask any pioneer, if you are in doubt.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Colporteurs Asked to Use New Forms</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Some colporteurs are still using old report cards and order blanks and addressing mail to 18 Concord Street. New forms have been printed. If you have none of these send us your order on the regular slip for ordering supplies and destroy the old forms. Please remember to use the new forms in ordering and in giving notice of all changes of address. They reduce the work here a lot and assure accuracy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>New Field for Pioneers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The Society has decided to open business districts in all class territory to the pioneer colporteurs, except where those districts are being canvassed by the class. Winter territory is available in certain large cities of 100,000 or more population also. Of course the assignment to work any of this territory must first be received from this office; otherwise we shall not know which territory is being worked. Whereas business districts are to be open to pioneers for both winter and summer, winter territory among the homes in the cities is to be for the period from December 1 to April 15 only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If any colporteurs wish to have an assignment of winter territory, please let us know where you would like to work. Among the cities which have reported, the following show sufficient uncanvassed territory to accommodate a number of pioneers in each place:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hartford, Conn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trenton, N. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Chicago, Ill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syracuse, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">New Bedford, Mass. Yonkers, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Grand Rapids, Mich. New York, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">St. Paul, Minn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toledo, Ohio</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">St. Louis, Mo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scranton, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Camden, N. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides these there are many other cities which can take care of from one to three colporteurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Millions Hear Message,</span><span class="font1"> continued from page 2) only $1.00 combinations, then each worker in those sections should present that combination to the people; and if it has been deemed advisable to present the $1.98 combination in Sections 1 and 2 of your assignment, then each worker should present that combination. This will give a uniformity of action and will impress upon the neighborhood an appreciation of the harmony and unity of the message and the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Do not worry about the stock of “The Peoples Friend” you have on hand. Arrangements will be made in due course for another special drive with that booklet.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Advantages of Combination Drive</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">From November 1 until the new year the people of this country have what might be termed a spending orgy. They buy all manner of things with little or no consideration of their value, as long as the thing purchased happens to appeal to them. This condition has been created and developed by the adversary and his agents for the purpose of defrauding the people and advancing their own selfish interests. We can take advantage of this condition for the good of the people and for the glory of the Lord’s name. We have the best combination of books in the world to offer them, when compared with other literature in the market today. The message that this combination contains exceeds everything else that can be considered. We have the most attractive-looking combination of books in the market. The new lightshade binding strongly appeals to the eye. In addition to the foregoing, the distribution of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font1"> has created a market for these books at the present time that can not be overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the December </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> we hope to have an outline of the campaign following January 1, as well as the quota of books, booklets and workers for the coming year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In order that this branch of the Lord’s organization may function more effectively and get greater cooperation from us, we request that all letters sent in by the sharpshooters be marked “Sharpshooter” in the left lower comer of the envelope and that the signature in every letter be followed by the letters “S.

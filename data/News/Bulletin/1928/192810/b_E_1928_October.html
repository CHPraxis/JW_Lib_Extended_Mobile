<p><span class="font1">October, 1928</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let my Lord, but give the word, the herald bands willbeamighty host.’’—Psa. 68:11, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HESE words, being a part of the sixty-eighth Psalm, have a very significant setting; and their very evident application is to our day, “the day of the Lord.” Those who are of the class described by Joel as ‘young men who see visions’ .mo-see that the time has come for Jehovah God to come forth and to reveal himself by an impressive demonstration of his power against all his enemies, Satan and all his organization, spiritual and earthly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Appreciating that the time is at hand for him to take action for the vindication of his name, this remnant class pray the prayer given in the first verse of this Psalm: “Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him floe before him.’’ This prayer being taken into the lips of the remnant shows that they lune no sympathy for the Lord’s enemies or those who hate him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The remnant have lined themselves up behind Jehovah and his chief executive officer. Christ Jesus. They appreciate that the Lord will do the actual, literal fighting, whereas they are not to use carnal weapons while the conflict is going on. Their part is t&lt; take their stand uncompromisingly on his side, to declare themselves for him and his anointed King, and just as boldly to declare themselves against God’s enemies, Satan and his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In full accord with the “times and seasons” of God’s plan and in full consistency with their understanding of the present state of affairs between God s organization and the diabolical enemy organization, the remnant, by representative, members tlwrvot assembled in general convention at Detroit, last August 5. passed a resolution declaring themselves against Satan and for Jehovah, and by the greatest hookup of radio stations then possible they broadcast this declaration to the world which now lieth under the wicked one. They adopted as their battle-cry the slogan of God’s chosen remnant of warriors in Gideon’s day: “The sword of Jehovah and of his Anointed.” They joyfully hailed the issuing of a fuller, clearer, and more comprehensive statement of the Lord’s glorious kingdom of righteousness as contained in that latest book. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dear brethren, has the Lord given the word? Has he given us the signal for untiring aggressive action against the enemy organization and in support of his righteous government and earth’s rightful Ruler? Has he given us bis Word, put together in printed form in the Society’s books in such an explanatory, orderly-connected way that not only his spirit-begotten children but also the peoples of the nations may understand it? If so, then what action will you take?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The prophecy above quoted shows what step Jehovah’s remnant wall take and are today taking. They have but to receive the message and the signal from the Lord through his regular channel, and at once they are ready to volunteer to herald his Word forth to all nations. They are not a ‘ ‘ mighty host ’ ’ in themselves but they are “strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might”. The Lord will exclude yon from the herald bands that publish his Word only if you by your course of action exclude yourself. To those who have not thus far appreciated their privileges of taking God’s printed message and serving as a member of his “herald bands”, the Lord lovingly yet wamingly says: “Be zealous therefore, and repent.” Let the word that the Lord has now given spur the appreciative, faithful ones tirelessly onward to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Two weeks have been set aside for distribution of the declaration adopted at Detroit, August 5. Beginning October 21 and continuing to November 4, exclusive attention will be devoted to the distribution of the five-cent booklet. This definite time is set aside so as to effect as wide a distribution of the booklet as possible in a short time. In order to attain this objective the method of procedure will be to concentrate all work in territory that will permit the greatest number of calls to be made in the time set aside. For instance, there are three Sundays included in the dates mentioned. The first Sunday’s work should be in the small though well-settled towns outside of the largest town in the county of your assignment. The canvass to be used is brief and to the point. The workers should be enabled to make a greater number of calls with this booklet than they could in the same amount of time canvassing for the other books; and to do this it will be necessary for each worker to undertake a greater number of calls than ordinarily planned and, having agreed to make this number of calls, to manage their work accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Speed Essential</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Work fast, but with due consideration and courtesy for those upon whom you call. Let your manner emphasize that your mission is an urgent one and that you have many other people to call on. If there is a disposition to engage in an argument or discussion of some topic, put this to the side with some apt remarks about your calling later at which time you will have more time to discuss matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second Sunday’s work should be in the more thickly populated sections of the city, particularly among the laboring classes. Here again the work should be undertaken early Sunday morning so as to enable you to call on the majority of the homes before the people leave for church and then to shift your work during church hours to sections of the territory known as of a non-churchgoing make-up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The third Sunday could be devoted to other sections of the city, but always the selection of territory should be of the more populated sections. The rurals and small towns can be canvassed during this last Sunday, provided the thickly settled territory has already been reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prepare for Emergencies</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Considering the season of the year, it would be too much to expect that all days two weeks wil<sup>1</sup> be &quot;fair and without rain; and yet there is a work to be de and to be done quickly. Without seeming’ be inconsiderate of the inconvenience t which workers will be put in rainy weather, we yet feel the real necessity of urging work * during such weather. Progress will not be -so great. More time will be required to make calls, but even a little work does much to- -ward reaching the greatest possible number of people in the time set aside. Reserve for such days sections of the territory in which the houses have porches and will aecommo-date rainy-day canvassing. Then, taking . due precautions for your health, go equipped'<sup>-</sup>!’ with raincoat, umbrella, etc., and then when calling adjust yourself to the conditions of the '• home, and, if need be, offer to leave your umbrella on the outside; and if your raincoat is wet, offer to take it off. This will gain you an entrance. People do not want wet -1, coats or umbrellas in a dry house, but consideration of the homes on which you call <sub>( </sub>will show the courtesy that people will be ! quick to notice.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark0"><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Plan Your Time</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1"><span class="font1">Speaking particularly to the sisters, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">we ; </span><span class="font1">recommend that steps be taken to adjust</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark2"><span class="font1">your time during this two-week period so</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">that you will be able to devote some hours twh day to territory in the vicinity of your home. Of course this will require planning • on the part of the director. He should know beforehand what territory you will work from your home during the week, and then be will reserve it and direct canvassing par-tics to territory beyond reach of the home. Among sisters probably each one can take tlie initiative in arranging duties or eooperating with other sisters who have homes, so that home duties can be cared for, such as, for instance, one sister serving as nurse for ’ the children of all the others in the class so that the others can go out, and each one in the class taking a turn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Begin Promptly</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Keep in mind that the important feature . of the drive is to begin on the day set and to end the special work with November 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;••</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After November 4 any territory that has not been covered is to be covered in conjunction ■ with the canvassing for the five-volume com- ! bination, or other combinations; but during &lt;&nbsp;the two weeks set aside strenuous effort and i intense application will be required, in order . ■ to finish the work by November 4. The time has been chosen with due consideration of all the conditions involved, prime<sup>-</sup>' from the standpoint of the interest of</span></p>

The message is more apropos and more applicable during the time in which it is to be told, and the greatest effect can be expected from a witness that is given when the truth of the message is timed with the interests of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:line-through;">------- —</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Last year when </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples</span><span class="font1"> came out, I was working with the Springfield class. We would go ! out and place 5, 7, 9 or possibly 15 | booklets, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> said we I should place 100. Finally I stumbled j upon a canvass that enabled me to i place 40, 80 or 100 in a day. One or | two other friends adopted it and were ; : as successful as I was, or even more</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">so. Perhaps it will help some one else. So I am writing it to you, adapting it to our new booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">‘Good morning. I represent Judge Rutherford, of New York. This is his lecture, &quot;The Peoples Friend,’’ that went forth from Detroit, Michigan, on August 5, in the greatest radio hook-up that ever took place in the world. This booklet shows the trouble and distress of the common peoples of earth, who is to blame for this condition, and our deliverance into life, liberty and happiness. We feel that the message this book contains is so vital to every man and woman on earth today that we are instructed to sell it for a nickel (if you have a nickel) or, if for any reason you haven’t the money, to give it to you if you would like to read it. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">‘ ‘ The last part did the work. They might have ‘No’ written all over their faces, but when I came to ‘if you have a nickel’ a change would come in their expression and almost invariably they would say, ‘Well. I guess I have a nickel,’ or ‘That’s fair ; enough. I’ll take one’. Of course we had to give away some, but the vast i increase in sales more than made up ; for it.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</span></p>

<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Know the Importance of Your Mission</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">•4 One lady asked me what proof I had that ‘ the books I sell are the true interpretation of Bible. She said, &quot;How am I to know your religion is different from the hun</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">dreds of others who claim to teach the Bible truths ?’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">She flatly refused to buy the books because she thought that I had no proofs that the books I was selling contained the truth ot God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So I gave her the proof by quoting Matthew 24:14. I then asked her which church on earth that she knew of was giving a witness unto all nations that God’s kingdom is being set up. She said she did not know of any. I took the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity</span><span class="font1"> booklet and turned to page 54 and showed her how many books the I. B. S. A. was able to place in the hands of thinking Christians in only a short time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I told her the books contain the message about the kingdom, and besides placing all those books in the homes of good people we are reaching millions of others by air on the radio. She at once called for the pocketbook and took the large set of three.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Directness Effective</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Another experience I had which was interesting was with a doctor who said that he never did and never will buy anything of reading matter from any one at the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I told him that was too bad; for by so doing he might miss the opportunity to know the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He said, &quot;The truth about what?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So I said, ‘ ‘ Concerning the origin of man, the reason why he is here on earth, and what is his destiny.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He asked me to come in and, after answering the few questions he asked, he wanted the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font1"> right away, and I gave him </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> No. 228. He promised to buy the two other books after he looks over </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lena Podworna, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Medfield, Mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the first ease mentioned, the statement that you are merely helping them to understand the Bible, or something equally indirect, would hardly have clinched the interest. Here the worker seized upon an up-to-date condition, showed that the work w<sup>r</sup>as to be done, demonstrated that they had the conviction that they were doing the work that was foretold. People with a purpose are always interesting and welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the second ease there was nothing but a prejudice against buying things at the door. Here again the worker stated directly why it was necessary to offer the books at the door. More and more, however, people are coming to appreciate the real service rendered by those who come to their homes with literature.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>E The Worker’s Approach Important</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font1"> Enclosed you will find my report card for work done in Detroit. My assignment seemed aj to be among the aristocrats. When we came to these wonderful mansions, I said to the friends, T “We are going to change our plans. Let every one of you be just as natural as you can. Look </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fit</span><span class="font1"> these people as poor suffering creatures and starving and yourselves as the great ones who</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">•'‘J have come to help them. Don’t let the Devil put before you their standing in this world, but 7 hold yourself far above them and as knowing that they need you. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">/ We completed our assignment by 3.00 p. m. and had only a few books left. I finally . adopted the plan of having the driver take the workers right up to the front door, just as ! though they were the owners, and stop at the door. The plan worked fine. Not the maid or ( butler, but the host came to the door. Just the one we wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">| On one occasion we noticed an old gentleman coming out of the garden, smelling some flowers he had just picked. This time we did not call at the front door but at the wicket lead-t ing to the garden. When he got up to me I said, “This is the most beautiful place I ever &gt;&nbsp;looked at.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I ‘ ‘ Oh, do you think so ? ” was his reply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&gt; I replied, “My friend, it puts me in mind of the Bible picture of the garden of Eden.” ‘ ‘ Oh, you ought to have looked upon it about a month ago when all the roses were in bloom. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Here I began my canvass with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font1"> following with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation, Deliverance, Harp, Where are the Dead? Last Days, Lord’s Return,</span><span class="font1"> showing him that the whole earth will be made like his garden when the kingdom comes, and God will use man to make it so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He said, “How much did you say the price was?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As he handed me a two-dollar bill he said, “The books are mine now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">They were all lying on the grass, and as I said goodbye he picked them up and said, “I will have something to read now.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S. S. Goodin, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Colporteur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The methods to be employed should be adapted to the territory; and workers will enjoy good success if they even adapt what they say and how they will go about their work to the house where they are about to call. As you approach the house note such things as whether the house looks neat and tidy or whether it looks as though the people were well-fixed, of the working class, or poor. Remarks that are suited to the individual case come home to much better advantage. It gives the people you are talking to an important place in what you have to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The point emphasized in the following letter is a good one to keep in mind when calling at the different homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I learned many things at the convention which are very helpful, especially to always agree ' no matter what the prospect may say. The other day a man told me he never read and had his library full. I agreed and put the books all back in the case. Then I talked of the grain business and around to the education his children were getting in the school. He confided that lie wished he had something to interest them in the church. In a few seconds he had </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. B. Larsen, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Colporteur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to the work of distributing the booklet, endeavor to permit your methods to accomplish a twofold purpose. See that the manner in which you urge the reading is such as to awaken the interest and pave the way for the placing of the message in permanent form in the hands of the people. It is essential that the people read the booklet; and if they do, it will be found that the. experience set forth in the following letter proves itself to be a real factor in effecting future results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I once thought that the offer of booklets would retard the sale of books, but, on the con-<sub>u</sub> trary, they assist. For a psychological reason I offer booklets last, and in the following order: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wd, hl, Ir, Id</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ps.</span><span class="font1"> In offering the books I use this order: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance, Harp, Creation, Reconciliation</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another experience. One’s first remarks are important. I begin with: “Judge Rutherford, the president of the International Bible Students Association, has written a number of Bible helps especially for the benefit, comfort and joy of the people.” From here I go rapidly'' through the books, making some startling remark about each one and winding up within a ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;couple of minutes with “all for only one ninety-eight, ordinarily the price of just one book”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;And I hold up the little library together so they can see it with backs of books turned to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ward them. I hesitate a little and then say, “Now the price of these books just covers the cost of production and distribution.” From hero on the answer is “yes” or “no”.</span></p>

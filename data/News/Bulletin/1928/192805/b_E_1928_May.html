<p><span class="font1">May 1, 1928</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONFESS WITH THY MOUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall lelieve in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shall he. saved.”—Romdtts 10; 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">T</span><span class="font1">ILE Apostle Paul, in the tenth chapter of his letter to the class of consecrated ones at Rome, argues as to the necessity of witness work on their part in order to be faithful to the Lord and to be saved. He climaxed his argument by quoting the Prophet Isaiah, who had written: “How beautiful the feet of those proclaiming glad tidings of good things!”—Romans 10:15, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We know of some who have the thought that the mere statement of belief on the Lord Jesus, made before some brethren at the time of baptism, is all that Paul had in mind, but a careful study shows that such was not the argument at all. “How shall they believe, where they did not hear? And how shall they hear without one proclaiming? And how shall they proclaim if they should not be sent?” (Romans 10:14,15, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott) “Ye </span><span class="font1">are my witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Paul's own life, after coming to a knowledge of the truth, is the best proof of his argument. Was he content with spending an hour or two a week in the witness work and the bulk of his time with the Devil’s organization ? Not much! A brilliant man he was iu the world, with a position of influence, ■wealth and ease at his command; but he considered anything the Devil’s gang had to offer only a pile of maajSft..compared with the privilege of proclaiming the glad tidings by word of mouth in going from door to door and from city to city. Here’s his record: ‘Many times in prison; five times whipped with forty stripes; thrice beaten with rods; once stoned; three times shipwrecked; in peril of waters; in peril of robbers; in peril by the Jews, by the heathen, in the city, in the wilderness, in the sea, amongst false brethren ; in weariness, in pain, in hunger, in thirst, in cold and without clothes.’ But never, after he came into the truth, did he give Satan’s organization any of his time and strength. He would rather sew tents for a time when he ran short of cash than get out of the witness work by taking a permanent job. Paul was really in the truth. How gracious, dear brethren, the Lord is to us in our time! How convenient and easy he has the message prepared for us, as compared with the. brethren of the early church, and still how comparatively few that, like Paul, make the witness work the chief business in life. If all the brethren in the truth would realize their responsibility, be satisfied with reasonable provision for their minor children and wife (the only Scriptural dependents), and spend more of their time in the canvassing work, what a wonderful and memorable year 1928 would be! How much more quickly the kingdom would be fully established!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We do not wish to appear as finding fault, but we would feel remiss in our duty if we did not call attention to the importance of the witness work at this time. Brethren, let’s do it right, as Paul did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">METHODS OF WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">IBSA Week, May 13 to 20, can bring the message of the kingdom to from 250,000 to 1,000,000 homes in the United States. We make mention of this great difference because the real attainment depends upon the time that each one of the consecrated can give to the service during IBSA Week. The plan for the first IBSA Week is to make the work </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">wide-spread witness. We should like each class to work in practically all corners and parts of their territory. Many people reside in small towns and rural districts. In the towns they group themselves along business streets, in factories or mills; in the city, in the thickly settled parts in which they reside. The work during IBSA Week should reach those parts of the territory where the greatest number of people can be reached in the shortest time. Some work should be done in each of the towns in the class assignment wherever this is at all possible. We have written the directors, giving a list of items that they should check np. We have laid emphasis upon planning the work to be done, and where it is to be done. We have asked each to get his plans in shape and then present them to the workers, and also to advise the workers how much time will be necessary in order to effect the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As to some of the ways in which the workers can arrange time for the work, we suggest the following: Arrange home duties so as to permit frequent service in the field during IBSA Week. Join convenient parties. Daylight-saving time will be in effect, which places an extra hour for work at the disposal of the workers before dark. This hour can be used in the service, particularly during IBSA Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Off Time.</span><span class="font1"> Probably a number of the friends, especially those who are paid on a monthly basis, or salaried people, can arrange to get an afternoon or a full day ot two off for field work. Arrangements can be made so that all Saturday afternoon could be devoted to field work, thus enabling practically all members of the class to have a share in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sunday Work.</span><span class="font1"> Extra effort could be put forth Sundays, by arranging for canvassing parties to go to towns farthest away, especially to the parts of the territory that require much time to reach. Canvassing during IBSA Week could be continued throughout the entire day. Careful planning as to what you will do during IBSA Week will accomplish more than going “when you can”. IBSA Week is important because the purpose of an effort so early in the year is to prepare the territory for work later on. The object for the week should be to get people in all parts of the territory talking about the message and thinking about it. See to it that after you leave, even in places where you do not sell, the people will feel much as expressed in the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I called at another home in Greenville where the lady had purchased some booklets of me the year before. She said, ‘Come right in, as I want to get some more of those' books. I just enjoy reading anything the Bible Students put cut, as it is so reasonable, and you learn so much about the Bible.’ She bought the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harp, Deliverance, Creation, Scenario </span><span class="font1">and some booklets. She expects to take the set and subscribe for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I am surprised many times to see how many people wish me the best of success in my work, and say that they should think that I must sell a lot, as they think that most every one would want some of those good books. Even business men tell me that they are glad I have come to their town with good books to place in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font1"> am particular to mention the radio, and find many people who are quite familiar with Watch Tower station WORD.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sins. C. G. Morgan.—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Alma, Mich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even at the homes where you do not sell books, leave some idea with the people about the work of the IBSA. Leave them looking forward to learning more about the message, and also impressed so favorably that they are going to inquire of their neighbors whether you called at their uomes and what they did about purchasing. This stirring up of talk in the neighborhood is one of the surest means of publicity. There will be occasions when you will feel inclined to answer people in a very short and curt manner; but avoid doing so. Remember that they will buy some time and that it is your duty to see that they will always be favorably inclined toward the message. Such a course is sure to react in favor of the truth. The following letter is an example of just one such instance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I borrowed a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">llarp, Deliverance</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font1"> from my partner and canvassed the postmaster at P----, a station about a mile</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">from 1)----. He bought them but seemed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rather fearful of them and did not want any one there to know he had bought them. He is superintendent of the Sunday school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“A few days later we made the same station on our way to E----. He came out</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">smiling and said, <sup>f</sup>I sure do appreciate those books.’ He was so thrilled with the things he was learning from them that he could not talk about anything else. Others came up while we were talking and he told them about the books and some of the things they taught. He said, Mudge Rutherford must be a wonderful man.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The next thing to give particular attention to is the amount of time you spend at each house. Keep always in mind the purpose of IB SA Week, which is to bring the message to the attention of as many homes as possible. Know that IB SA Week is not to allot an extra amount of time to any one town or home, but to bring the message to as great a number of people as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Aim at work that brings results such as the following letter describes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The people, with but few exceptions, accepted out message gladly. We worked about ten hours in Ducktown and sold sixty-four bound volumes and a few booldets, and we were there just a few days before their payday. The books sold wcre </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Creation</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>££</sup>We worked about eight hours in Isabella and sold one hundred twenty-six books and booklets. Sold out each day before finishing the town, but had taken all the books we could manage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Peael Mobley.—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Etowah, Tenn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another important thing to keep in mind is to go to the people when they can be reached. Business sections should be canvassed at that time of the day when the storekeepers are not busy. Offices and office buildings should be canvassed when the office workers are not so busy. An opportune time to canvass factoiy workers is during the noon-hour, and especially when they sit about eating their lunch. Also learn when the people are paid. Oftentimes the excuse of “no money” is a legitimate one and merely means that the workers should have called shortly after pay-day, when the people have money. The following letter emphasizes the advantages of reaching the people when they can buy the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“We are averaging about seven sales out of every ten calls, although at times it is only a five-cent book. We are doing better now than we have done in a long time. We find that where the books have been sold to the white people in the South they soon find out what it is and they give the books to their colored help. That is why I find so much interest among the colored people. We give two days to the colored people, and from five to six days to the white people, and find we are successful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thomas .1, Scannell, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Colp.—Ala.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is much easier for the people to buy when they have the cash than for them to give an order for delivery at the time they will have money. In fact, IBS A Week should single out all the opportunities of placing the message quickly, and the workers should go to the places where people congregate; for in this manner they can reach a greater number of people in the same length of time. The recommendations of the following letter are very much to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Our method of selling books, and especially the booklets, which the friends can use, but usually overlook, is to go to the laboring people at their marketing places on Saturday afternoons and evenings. They are usually paid on Saturday afternoons and then go to markets, barber shops, ete., and also have some leisure time and are thus in a receptive mood to hear and to buy. I offer this suggestion. Many of the brethren can do this who are employed in secular work curing the week. In one city (Charlotte, N. C.) a brother, who is a mechanic, and I went out and sold about a hundred booklets in this way after supper one Saturday night. There is blessing upon the head of him who sells this message to the people. (Proverbs 11:2G)”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A. L. Paschall, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Colp., Fla.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Preparation is a necessary part of the work for IBSA Week. It will mean acquaintance with the field and with what the people are thinking about, and will enable you to know how to go to them. Therefore arrange to spend some time in the service before IBSA Week, to brush up on your method of approach and your method of canvassing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Canvasses.</span><span class="font1"> It is important to be up to date in what you say. Otherwise your canvass becomes singsong. Work up new talking-points. Make mention of things that are up to date. Be familiar with the books for which you canvass. Single out the talking-points of each book. See to it that no one talking-point is repeated in referring +fr.the different bMks. Eaclk-Louk -riiwdd have its own talking-points, and these points should be different from those of any other of the books. Draw attention to the illustrations and colored pictures and other features of the books that make them especially valuable. Workers’ meetings present an excellent opportunity to find out what the other workers think about your talkingpoints. If each of the workers will tell what his individual talking-points are, it will bring to the surface other things than those which auy one worker has thought about. The talking-points that should be adopted are the ones that bring results; and they bring results when they interest the people. Arrange for special workers’ meetings that will prepare the workers for IBSA Week: meetings that will go over canvasses analytically with a view to finding out that which is best. Take occasion to canvass other workers. Particularly should the one being canvassed mention points aside from what he expects the worker is going to talk about in his canvass, so as to demonstrate to those who are listening how and when it is necessary to adjust what you are saying to that which the people are interested in and thinking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Preparation is necessary if the best results are going to be had; and since IBSA Week is going to be the greatest week, the more preparation given the more competently will the message be presented and the better will be the hearing accorded each worker. Our estimate at the beginning of this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin, </span><span class="font1">that w-orkers could canvass from 250,000 to 1,000,000 people during IBSA Week, is based upon the following: If 10,000 workers will each make hut twenty-five calls during IBSA Week, they will call at 250,000 homes. However, if the 10,000 workers can arrange </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to give time Saturday, Sunday, at least two evenings of the. week, and one other afternoon,</span><span class="font1"> they can call at approximately a million homes during the week; and if each of the 10,000 workers sets his personal quota of calls at a hundred homes, then there would be a million families reached by the workers. Depending upon the people reached with the message to talk about it to at least one, and possibly two or three, of their friends, workers can then&quot;graspiu)fv great will be the witness throughout the territory during the week of May 13 to 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The radio will be cooperating and preparing the field for your work. Each class that is doing any broadcasting has been requested to announce the programs broadcast as being by the Watch Tower. Hence, you already have an introduction when you call at the homes, and you will identify yourself if you say that you are representing the Watch Tower, or make mention of the Watch Tower in the early part of your introduction. By extra effort and with great zeal and energy, the message will be brought to the attention of many. The Lord has promised to show his favor and blessing upon all such, and we trust that your share as a worker will be many blessings from the Lord, stimulating, strengthening and increasing your faith in him and bringing you much joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With much love in the Lord, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your brethren in his service,</span></p>

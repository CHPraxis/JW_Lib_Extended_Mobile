<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark1"></a>WHAT WE DO</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God/&quot; (1 Corinthians .10:31) “ Wkatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord.&quot; ■ -Colassians 3:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">^17 7 </span><span class="font4">E FEEL sure that quite a number </span><span class="font6">W <sup>c</sup>'$</span><span class="font4"> the consecrated have an incor-’ reci idea as to what was meant by the apostle when he wrote the two statements quoted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">'Recently a brother gave us the above statement from Colossians to sustain him in bis position, of spending practically all of bis time at the barber trade. Both he and his wife are young, reasonably able-bodied, live in a nicely furnished flat, have an automobile, and no children, lie said he was doing all his barber work “heartily, as to the Lord”. Of course he’s mistaken in bis thinking that Jehovah is at ail glorified in the hearts and minds of people by shaving their faces and cutting their hair; or that the Lord would accept such as hearty service unto himself. The apostle was writing about the conduct of Christian slaves toward their owners and this has no application whatever to these two young folks who could just as well spend all their time in the pioneer colporteur work, witnessing that Jehovah is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the first above-quoted scripture, Paul is outlining the proper attitude in matters of eating food offered to idols, drinking wine, or any other conduct when some Christian fellow gimst is present, whose faith is weak. In the verses following he writes that in the things he was doing, he was not aiming at his own profit but at that of the many in the hope t’ud they might be saved. That would, be glorifying the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Really Glorifying the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no foundation in the Bible to uphold those who tliir-k they can drive along at almost any kind of work, and that so long as they attend class meetings and give a few hours a month to the witness service, the Lord will count all they do as unto him. Of course there are those who must work at some outside business to provide for their families, where there are minor children, or other Scriptural obligations. Nor is ‘providing for one’s own’ nearly as broad an obligation as some interpret it, who include uncles, aunts, mothers-in-law, parents, nieces, brothers, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a wonderful year 1928 would, be in glorifying the Lord if every one of the fully consecrated would make ‘witnessing that Jehovah is God’ his very own business for the year, giving to the service as many weeks, or days each week, as could possibly be. squeezed in. Let us, dear brethren, treat the service really as our own, which it is.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">|/.gA'.' Th® purpose of IBS A Week is to give a ■ |: '/ -world-wide witness to the work that the In-1/' , termtfonal Bible Students Association is do- ’ |/<sup>:/</sup>' ing; and that work is witnessing that Je-i ■ established upon the face of the earth, and | <sub>;</sub> . that his King is present</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">| IFtasw </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to Be Wide-Spread</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">|| ■ Ifi order that the witnessing during IBSA ||<sup>7</sup> ■ ' <sup>:</sup> Weefc might be scattered as widely as pos-||:/<sup>:</sup>&quot; our rec@mmendation is that the work |t ' be. tamed on in as many towns in the ter-| - .. ritory as it is possible to reach.

<p><span class="font4">Rather than concentrate all efforts in one |p. /..hity &gt;nd work that city quite thoroughly, the II&quot;. './.pta. is to witness in as many localities as II/:;. I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and select in each town the portions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">|||||:::|. Mi# Wl gain the most attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">p”<sup>:</sup>&quot;'&quot; &quot;We recommend that particularly the busi-||:. ■ ntas sections of the towns be canvassed, and, in instances where there are factories, that I/.;-' workers canvass the men' during the noon <sup>:</sup>;|.d '■'■hour, and that the afternoon work be in the 1/■■ .mote ■thickly populated sections of the towns, |./<sup>:</sup> rwhetolfe .greatest number of calls can he I/// p mid® w. the time, devoted to' the service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">IBSA Week. We urgeAhat'W/workmO-&quot; vass for a ■■combination thateontmii-'atieait.:' one bound volume. We espedali^'\te«pKi.<sub>: </sub>that no worker confine his anwAg'to|&amp;O/ let combinations. ■The took etenbihaifota.. that workers should offer-'are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Combination of nine-&quot;volumes, consisting of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, Deliverance,</span><span class="font4"> and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Scriptures,</span><span class="font4"> at $3.00;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Combination of three volumes, eonsfetfag of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font4"> at $1.18;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Combination of two volumes, consisting of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font4"> at 78c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Workers are at liberty to add whatever booklets they wish to the combinations above' recommended, particularly trying to include in whatever offer is made the two new booklets, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prosperity Sure</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Last Days, </span><span class="font4">Of course there are occasions and circumstances which govern the canvassing with any of the combinations above recommended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Combmaiwn for Back C&amp;U®</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the first IBSA Week we believe it-would be better to confine work with the $3.00 combination to back calls, or especially offer it to people who yon know already have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span><span class="font4"> Some'territory has been thoroughly worked with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God.</span><span class="font4"> In such territory confine tt® canvass to the 78c combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our records indicate that about one-half the territory was covered last year with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span><span class="font4"> In such instances it would be well to offer </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font4"> and a number of booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Advantage in Knowing Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Workers should report to the director the names of the 'different towns in which they have canvassed during the last year. Workers, no doubt, can recall in what homes they 'sold books; and much time will be' saved ..if: workers will canvass the same territory feint offer to such people the books that the wrkp'<sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">they already taw, as tita often raMs ttam</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tead$ at least not completely, and to think |^^||||:||;||^^^</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bj|||ti^Ji'' Wehave askedthe directors to, llilliiilii^</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">PiSl^ </span><span class="font4">'rifteha® in which books have !'■■ /Ilfc/placed.' We trust that the workers will ^7'/|B|&gt;erate in the work in the way suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">those workers who can not engage in hi&amp;'Wtok during the daytime, during IBS A lllill we recommend that they particularly k<sup>:</sup><sub>:</sub> Overtake to make back calls with sets of m </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the Scnpiwes</span><span class="font4"> in the evenings, toftd that they go to various towns in the territory rather than concentrate their efforts yMw or two .of the larger cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■/'&quot;■'■In order that the best results may be ob-i turned from the time and effort put into the .<sup>:</sup>' work during IBS A Week, preparation will be necessary. Therefore, during the coming 7 months endeavor to get into the field service ■■' Wh week. Get well acquainted with what ■;■ th® people are interested in, what issues oc-'-' cupy their minds, how they can. best be 7 /arod and what most effectively interests /■ ■ them an the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prepare Yourself</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">;. When you come together in workers* meet-| lugs, note particulariy the points that are 7 bringing th® best results; then try these ;/' pointe the next time you go into the field, not ii ■ necessarily following a verbatim canvass but using the points _ that a successful worker t /'makes 'mention of and, of course, using them |.&quot;/in your own way. Thus, by IBS A Week in |;/:1fay you will be able to take the field with a canvass well in mind that is short, pithy i;./^ad' to' the point, and that wastes no time;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">IBS A Week is to reach the greatest num-of homes possible in the time put into |'l/the- service. At such homes where you call, |/7wlW''ihe talk lengthens itself to a discus-texts .or opinions, endeavor to with-by/ making an appointment for a later will'be'ample time throughout to allow for talks with.the.more</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Purpose of fBSA Week</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">purpose of IBS A Week,-'Which ia-.'to call tot the mathomes possible&quot; and 'to wite^toW'i many people as possible in as many' different/ towns as it is possible to work in. If <sup>:</sup> bwhw;' sections. are very.'Small and are quidfcly' worked, complete them in the morning, and give attention to' some of the other sections of the city, and then proceed to the nearby ' towns for work in the afternoon. Where business sections are large, cover the businew section in the morning, the mill or factory workers during their noon hour, and ths more thickly populated parts of the city in the afternoon. In this way you will haw ^witnessed;to: all sectors- nf /your^territory ing IBSA Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work of the International Bible Students Association will be under discussioa not only in one community but in practically every small community in the class assign*-ment. This is the sort of witnessing that IBSA' Week is to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Foundation for Summer*® Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We trust that IBSA Week during May will do much toward opening the work to® the summer months and that your efforts during IBSA Week will be entered into with such study and forethought as is necessary in laying, plans for greater activity throughout the summer. Especially keep in mind'that greater results will be had during the summer if people know something about your work. If the books you place or the message you leave with those whom you canvass impresses them favorably, they are going ternate mention of the message to their friends; and their friends will be anticipating your visit and will be in all the more favorable and receptive mood to hear when you do call. Lay the foundations for your ■snmmer..wotfe. ■during IBSA Week. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'..</span></p>

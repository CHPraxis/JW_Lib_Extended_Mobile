<p><span class="font4">F</span><span class="font1">OR the Christian, there is no middle ground in the matter of service. J He is serving either the Lord or the ) Devil, and each one must decide whom J &nbsp;&nbsp;he will servo. Jesus emphasized service</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">J &nbsp;&nbsp;when he said, “He that is chief among</span></p>

Let / us try to get the Lord’s viewpoint on the y subject of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">’ / Briefly, service means to do something i for the benefit of another, and to serve </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">.

<p><span class="font1">note some: “Ye are a chosen generation, . . . that ye should show forth the praises of him.” Developing a beautiful, character would not show forth God’s praises; it would not benefit God; it would benefit ourselves, and give us a good name among </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">men.</span><span class="font1"> Again, “Let your li</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">ght </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">so</span><span class="font1"> s</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">hine b</span><span class="font1">efore men that they may see your good works7and~^on^’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">your Father.&quot;</span><span class="font1"> Perfecting a sweet, gentle, patient, forbearing and kindly spirit will not glorify </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">God;</span><span class="font1"> it would glorify nobody but </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ourselves.</span><span class="font1"> The only way to glorify God is to sing his praises, to tell others of his plan and purpose. “Herein is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">my Father</span><span class="font1"> glorified, that ye bear much fruit.” The fruit mentioned in this text must be the fruit of our efforts in his service; that is, helping others to an understanding of Jehovah’s attributes and plan. Still again: God “hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; . . . and the word of reconciliation,” and “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ.” (3 Cor. 5:18-20) “We are workers together with God.” All these texts mean service, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font1"> the development of character. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Think of the amount of service required to bring these beautiful truths to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">you,</span><span class="font1"> and simple gratitude will inspire every good man to. do all in bis power to bring these same blessings to other hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus laid aside bis heavenly glory for thirty-three and one-half years, suffered untold ignominy and a cruel death—a service for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">you.</span><span class="font1"> The writers of the, Bible did this service for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">you. </span><span class="font1">Think of the years of study, of weary effort, of pain and reproach, all gladly given as a service to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font1"> by that faithful and wise servant. Think of the .number of times your city or village has been covered with tracts and canvassed, before the truth came to you—all rendered as a service to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">you,</span><span class="font1"> and then say, “Here am f, Lord, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">send me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Which master are you serving?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>A Two-fold Service</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Your work with the Dbijvebance book will roach the people in a two-fold manner: First, by placing the book in the home (and the De-liveeance book is really offered to the people at a price of a few cents more .than the cost of a magazine) ; and second, your efforts will bring to them every other week a printed lecture that is built entirely upon the Dbuveeanoe ..book and so arranged as to emphasize the principal gems that the book contains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition, then, to placing a book in the homes of the people, your efforts really serve in a way that reaches directly the minds of the people with the message of the truth; and also, we trust, places on their reading table a folder that will be read by all in the house. This, then, naturally awakens an interest in the further literature; and the workers who place a Deliverance ijOcli are creating a field of work for those who cannot engage in the service during the day, but must use evenings in calling upon people.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Fall Campaign</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The fall months will more or less confine activities to nearby territory; and though there are many more duties to engage your ti r.n- than during the summer months, yet we trust that ways will be found, and that means will be worked out by the director with the cooperation of the workers, to maintain the activity in the field at a higher degree than during the fall and winter months of previous years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reports tliat we are receiving from workers indicate that there has been a wide influence in past activity, an influence that has left its. mark with those who have consistently opposed the work. We believe that this assures more</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">more and better results in recanvassing territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font1">want to tell you of our experience at Winchester, Indiana, a town of about 4,500 -population. About a year ago we advertised for a public meeting at a theatre. We used newspaper advertising and also distributed announcements from house to house. About a dozen people were present. We wondered why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About a month ago we had another public meeting, advertised the same as the first; and only two of the public attended. So some of us thought that the Lord wanted us to shake the dust from our feet and let them sleep on. But the workers prevailed, that we canvassed the town with the booklets ; and the report now lying before me shows five day’s work there, with 1S7 combinations of three booklets sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This town is 18 miles from Muncie. The workers would take a machine and drive over and take their lunches with them, thus giving themselves an outing, a day of fellowship and the blessedness of relating their experiences. God works in mysterious ways. We thought that your knowing of this might be the means of energizing others who know of places where they think the people are asleep, to awaken them and at the same time bring blessings to the workers.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Recanvassing Shows Results</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">We believe from this that workers are warranted in undertaking a canvass, particularly of territory that has been frequently covered, with more assurance that people are gradually coming to sec that the Lord has a message for them at this time; that they are coming to see that the Lord is using certain ones to give forth this message; and, additionally, to recognize who it is that the Lord is using.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your own neighborhood, then, we hope will show results similar to that recorded in the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Last week while canvassing in Covington I got into territory which I had covered late in the spring; so I decided to pass six of the houses—some of the people were prejudiced. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font1">thought it too early to try again. However, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font1">could not resist going into the last house on the street, and to my surprise sold three books. As I went out of the gate I looked back to the houses I had passed, and decided to go back and at least </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">try</span><span class="font1"> to place a few books in them. The result was a sale in every house, thirteen books in all. After this I shall skip no more houses so recently canvassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yesterday I called on a lady in my neighborhood who In past years has been vitriolic in her denunciation of me. I never thought for a moment that she would as much as let me in; but she was lovely to me, listened interestedly to my canvass and bought two books. She also invited me to call again. People today are buying books wbo a few years ago would not think of giving you a moment They are also expressing the hope that they might he of the “millions” class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">—Lillian M. Pinkerton, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Probably this is due to the people considering what you have told them. A new view often provokes an argument. A new view often makes people antagonistic and combative; but after thinking matters over, weighing what has been said, and comparing it with their previous conceptions and opinions, often they get the new angle of the view that was presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I have found out that those who do not receive me the first time do better the second time I call on them.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Truth Alone Can Satisfy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The activities of the summer months have covered much territory. The message has been placed before a ^eat. nninbef ortpeupib 7 ahtrt'fire<sup>-</sup>believe that the activities of the coming winter months will find many of these people in a more receptive mood than when you first called on them. Time and circumstances alter the conditions that prompted the people to act in the past, and quite likely such experiences emphasize to them how much they really do need the message of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am so glad that the Buix.wptn emphasizes so strongly the necessity for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">persistency</span><span class="font1"> in our efforts in the city, which has been canvassed over and over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I had an experience lately, however, which was very encouraging, and proved how the attitude of the people changes from time to time. I bad canvassed a house some time ago where the lady very rudely turned me away, saying that she had just taken up Christian Science and was entirely satisfied. On re-canvassing that street just lately, I almost passed up her house, thinking that it would be useless to waste time there. But thinking that the Lord would not be pleased to have me do that, I stopped, and to my surprise found her ready and anxious to listen to everything I told her. She told of her disappointment in Christian Science, and seemed to rejoice to hear of the kingdom that would do for her all that Christian Science had failed to do. She said, “I have just been praying the Lord to show me the right way, and I believe He sent you here. Oh, what if I had not let you come in!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">She gladly took The Harp and other literature, and wants the volumes as soon as possible. On my last call she had read only a part of The Harp, but said that she had discarded Christian Science entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The experience was a lesson to me to be faithful and persistent in declaring the message, and never to pass one up, knowing not “which shall prosper, whether this or that”.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>“Greater W orks”~Feiver Workers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">In the following letter the records indicate the real results that later years’ canvassing show; and with the people more disposed during the coming months to give time to reading, in fact, to employ reading as a means of evening amusement, we feel that all communities will likely show an equal increase in the number of homes reached, as is reported in this letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This message today is to point <sub>ou</sub>t some difference in seven years. In one small town, Rentchler, Illinois, is a small mining eamp, having three small, mines. In 1919 the three mines&quot;ivere<sup>-</sup>wofking’ every<sup>-</sup>day, 'and every-body seemed happy. Two workers spent eight hours in the town, selling only eleven books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Last week I spent eight hours canvassing the town.. The mines have been closed for two years. Everybody seemed sad. .First I thought there would not be much done, but was very much surprised when finished to see that I had sold thirty-six books. I am glad that I was one of the workers in 1919 and the one worker in 1926, and for his grace to hold me in his service ami his knowledge to see how wonderfully our King can do his work no matter how few the workers; and I am rejoicing iu his loving service more than my mind can explain to you. Hartl times seem to cause men to think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So we find a great difference in our labor. 1919: 2 workers, S hours, 11 books. 1926: 1 worker, 8 hours, 36 books.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Those Long Winter Evenings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The rural districts during the winter months are practically neglected; and yet this part of the territory probably more .than any other is open to reading and studying as an occupation for the longer day. So, then, whenever weather</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">permits, keep these rural communities in mind and try to reach as many of them as the fall months will allow; for interest is surely growing, and such districts will be found to be more awake, due to the activities of I. B. S. A. Week and the closing work of the summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By His grace I have enjoyed another two weeks in His dear service. Russellville, like Roachdale, is a small place, with not much work; and I am more and more impressed with the wisdom of the command to east the bread on the waters, for Ave know not w'hich shall prosper; and if we neglect the advice io see to it that the rural districts have the opportunity to get the literature, we are certainly law-breakers I The fanners are as ready, if not more so, than some of the townspeople, for the comfort of God’s lovable truth. They </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font1"> to know what the outcome of it all is. Sold two sets in the &quot;&nbsp;country today.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Many reports that we have received about </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font1">favorable attitude of the people indicate that there is a great field for labor, and really impress us with the necessity of helping this </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">field </span><span class="font1">. by supplying their wants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">________One </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">ladv</span><span class="font1"> and her husband . (both , over eighty years old) acknowledged that the Bible Students are teaching the truth. They took The Golden Age for a year because they could read the type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another lady said, “You tell me that Judge . Rutherford is the author of The Harp, but it sounds like the International Bible Students. I heard much about’ them and their teachings, but never had an opportunity to get their literature.” She bought the eight volumes and thanked me for calling. Sold a number of Harps and other booklets, besides taking subscriptions for The Golden Age and The Watch Tower, in the same community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">—Adolehine Lass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fall months mean much, then, In the work; and we trust that workers will talk over with the director the amount of time that they ' feel they can employ during the winter months, and cooperate with him in the plans that he may work out to effect a wider witness and distribution of the message in the remainder of this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Enclosed find report for the week just ended. I used the method (this week more than ever before) referred to in The Watch Towes some time ago, and also in the Bulletin, that we should canvass our next-door neighbor as well us those further away. As a rule, I used to prefer to canvass a stranger rather than some one whom I know well; but of late I have canvassed many people whom I have known fot years but have never canvassed for the books before. Every one of the six full sets that I have sold this week went to people who in I have never before had the courage ~to.....canvas^&quot; fof~tEe</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">books. And I have received great blessings through that very thought.</span></p>

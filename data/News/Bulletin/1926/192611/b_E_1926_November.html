<p><span class="font1">O DOUBT the so-called practical application of this text has its place in the Christian life. One who would, see a fellow Christian weak </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">-tttr»±--u+tab]e </span><span class="font1">to isuppvrt-idinbeif woiml nut be showing the spirit of Christ if he withheld necessary aid. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But there arc people who have found that the easiest way to get through life </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font1">to put themselves into such a position that they are financially weak, and then make a strong representation to others more industrious and more prudent that they ought to devote their energies to ministering to their physical wants. This is a misuse of this text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are things that people need more than they need financial support. Such support might be the ruin of one, and this has often been the case. It is a positive advantage to the reasonably robust that they make their own way in the world. We see this illustrated all around us in the material world. Those that have been most cared for are least able to care for themselves. Those who have never depended upon any other person than themselves to make </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">living are Ixfld ay It to-make one, most independent and happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But in the Christian world things ai'e a little different. The world is filled with thousands of theories, some wholly false, vast numbers a little true but largely false, a less number true in any considerable measure, while the truth itself is hard, to find and easy to lose. The Lord himself so declares. “Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leads to life; and few there be that find it.” —Matthew 7: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Christian world there are those weak in the faith that need our help. We have just what they need. What they need is the good news of the kingdom, the good news which has been entrusted to us, and which we have in superabundant measure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Why is this truth given us? Is it for out own enjoyment merely? The answer is plain. It is given to us to be used to the Lord’s glory, and the best way that most of us can do it is to get. the hooks which contain this message in practical and attractive form into the hands of the weak ones that need it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And if we do this we shall find it true just as the Lord said. “It is more blessed to give than to receive.’• It is indeed more blessed to give the truth to somebody than it is to receive it. It is blessed both ways, but there is a joy in hearing testimonies to the truth given by the newly interested which none on earth can enjoy so much as those who helped them to get into the light. The books contain the message that will do this.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>“What Shall I Give?”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">November brings close to band the holiday season and the holiday festivities. The season’s influence will be seen in the homes that are to be visited, and timely suggestions will probably place a number of books jn the homes </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font1">be </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">used as gifts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Studies in the Scriptures and the Deliverance book at 82.1'8 is a gift that most people will appreciate. Gifts of wearing apparel often are wasted, because the giver did not consider the taste of the one to whom the gift is sent. Books can be used throughout the year and arc not confined entirety to seasonal influence, as are many of the gifts exchanged at Christmas time. Then, too, there are the cheaper-priced gifts that people like to give to the grocery hoy, mailman, school teachers, and others who serve the interests of. the family. The Deliverance book </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a,</span><span class="font1">nd lecture series, or The Haup of God and the Bible Study Course is an inexpensive gift that could be suggested to the people for such use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We urge the ■workers to make free use of this suggestion and to pass it on to the people they canvass as a suggestion for Christmas buying. Resourcefulness, then, will likcdy place a great number of the book's in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">hands of </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">people that </span><span class="font1">they might pass them to others: and the seizing of opportunities that present themselves, even though they seem unfavorable, will likely find the message of the truth in a greater number of homes. The following letter is one that indicates just how a partly open door can furnish an opportunity for a sale:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One woman came to the door after I had rapped a great many times. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I knew </span><span class="font1">some one was at home, because I heard a low commotion inside, and I kept </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">up the </span><span class="font1">rap until I got an answer. The woman came to the door, opened it a little, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font1">said. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“1 </span><span class="font1">am too busy to talk to you. I don’t want w'hat you have any way. I am going to entertain the chib tomorrow and I’m bathing my dog right now.” I said, Oh, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font1">never saw a dog get a bath; may </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font1">see it? She said, “You surely may come right in; he is the best little doggie.” </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font1">went in and as she bathed the dog I told tier about the wonderful Bible books I had for sale. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">After a minute or two she </span><span class="font1">stopped bathing the dog and with a bright smile said, “Say, that’s interesting.” Then for two more minutes T had all of'</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">her </span><span class="font1">attention. She took Deliverance and Harp Bible Study Course, and said, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“I </span><span class="font1">will want all those books if it’s as good as that.” She followed me to the door and thanked me for stopping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; One other woman was getting ready to go camping. When I went in she was wiping dishes. I took the tea towel and wiped, while I explained about the books. She ordered Deliverance and she also wants the set later. She followed me to the door and with tears in her eyes thanked me for stopping. I wouldn’t have offered to wipe the dishes, but I could see that she had much to do and I could tell her about the. books just as well working as not; but she quit </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">her work and listened </span><span class="font1">spellbound. Oh, but it is blessed to be privileged to tell the truth to one as hungry as she was! Her husband, who is </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font1">infidel, came in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">as I was talking to </span><span class="font1">her. I noticed an impatient </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">look </span><span class="font1">on his </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">face, </span><span class="font1">but when </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">he saw I was helping his wife </span><span class="font1">his </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">expression changed. The husband see-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ing an agent helping with the work while she talked was a new stunt for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">News items or little items of information about conditions in a community such as a worker or colporteur finds arc of interest to the people. It helps them to establish a sort of relation between your work, themselves and the rest of the community ; and above all it helps them to see that you have called and presented your works and that others have appreciated your efforts.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Books Within Reach of All</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">During the Christmas season there will be -quite a bit of money spent for baubles of one sort or another, which indicates that the people will, have money to spend for the books if the matter is placed before them. The following excerpts from a letter are timely observations along this line:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No one is so poor but that he can get our books if he wants them; for every' one has money to spend, and can get at least a booklet (or a GA sample as a gift), and there find the address and send' later' and get the books. I often tell them, “We don’t want you to pay us a cent for the good things in these books. They are free. Jesus never commissioned anybody to sell the gospel. He said, Trecly have ye received, freely give.’ All yon pay for is merely the cost of materials and handling —just the eight </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paper sacks</span><span class="font1"> to carry home the spiritual food.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another point which helps to decide the issue in the prospect’s mind, as between physical necessities and our books, is: “This is something that is left out in the schools. The devil’s printing presses are running night and day, turning out stuff by the ton, that is not fit for any one, to say nothing of children, to read. If they are ever to have opportunity of learning serious things of real importance they will have to get it in the home; for the schools, papers and novels of today do not have them and they will not learn them going up and down in society and autos today.” The parental instinct is still a strong one; and a proper appeal io it often turns the tide of thought to the side of truth, and a sale.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>A Colporteur’s Method</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Free use of the volumes, by pointing to interesting paragraphs, is also a successful means of interesting people ; and especially in helping them to decide that the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font1">interest a friend for whom they do want something to serve as a Christmas gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The following is a method a colporteur uses; and no doubt his frequent reference to the different paragraphs in the volumes is contributing much to his success. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Deliv</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">erance book lends itself well to this method. It can lie opened to almost any page and some interesting and pertinent paragraph selected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In regard to my method of canvassing the business districts, I make up a prospectus of my own by cutting out the following pages from the various volumes and pasting them in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The Hasp of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Page 334 (Volume 5). which shows that the word “soul” in the Old Testament is translated from the Hebrew word &quot;nephesh,” and this Hebrew word besides being translated by the English word soul is also translated in 35 other ways in the Old Testament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Page 69 (Volume 1). which gives the Scriptural meaning of the symbolic words “heavens” and “earth”, and refers to the three worlds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pages 11, 259, and 260 (Volume 7), which call attention (a) to the Sinaitic Manuscript of the New Testament, and the faithfid. use made of it in interpreting the Book of Revelation to get at the pure Scriptural truth; (b) the mysterious “eighth king” which is the real world issue of the hour; and (c) the, reign of the ten kings one hour with the beast and the effect of this reign on the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Page 10 (Volume 7), showing the valuable works of widely known authorities which were consulted and quoted in compiling </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font1">material of the Seventh Volume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Page 109 (Volume 3), referring to the cleansing of God’s true church or sanctuary and the work of the Luther Reformation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Then I mark my Harp with paper clips to enable me to locate quickly what I want to refer to in the book; I also take Volume </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font1"> with my prospectus iu a Boston bag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1 go into all the business places if they are not all busy. I generally ask the first person .1 come to that looks as if he or she might have authority, who arc interested in the Scriptures there. Then I give my canvass to those that have an ear to hear. A few times it occurs that it is necessary to </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ask </span><span class="font1">the “boss” for permission to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I aim to show iu my canvass the difference between the old manuscripts of the Bible and the accepted authorized version </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">the Scriptures. Then </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font1">emphasize how the seven volumes of the Studies and the other bound volumes base their interpretation of Scripture upon the accurate readings of these ancient and authentic manuscripts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">If any one asks to see </span><span class="font1">the books themselves, I go at once and get them, provided I do not think a preacher is following me up in order to stop my sales. Likewise, when I take an order, I deliver it at once, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font1">possible, unless, as before stated, a • preacher is trying to stop my other sales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font1">this latter case I wait until my orders are all taken, and then I deliver them. I endeavor to prove all my statements from </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>People’s Interest Growing</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">From the number of repeat orders we are receiving at headquarters it is apparent that the Deliverance book is being well received </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font1">the people. We have not suggested </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">canvass for the Deliverance book, leaving it mainly to the workers to evolve their own canvass, and we are receiving many letters like the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Deliverance books go fine. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In five </span><span class="font1">weeks have sold one-half as </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">many (save </span><span class="font1">two) as </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font1">did Harps in as many </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This but indicates what can be accomplished by frequent and free reference to the volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In urging the people to consider favorably the purchase of the books, it might he well to keep in mind the report of the following letter from Cuba. It really indicates that we who appreciate the truth should not hesitate to put forth our best efforts in presenting the truth to the people; and when we realize that much depends upon our presenting the message, as to whether it is going to find its way into the home ot not, we should then all the more put forth a studied effort to get the message into the homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We heard, the people say, '‘When we could buy these books -we did not; and these books are the only books that tell us the truth.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>“Ye Are My Witnesses”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The following letter is another which places emphasis upon the fact that we cannot mention too directly the message of the truth. We can hardly be too positive that we represent the truth and the message due the world at this time rather than representing some sectarian body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One sister canvassing in a rural section called at two homes, where in each instance she was told that if our books had anything to do with the church systems they would not look at them. On being assured that out message was from the Lord and that all God’s faithful witnesses bad come out from these systems, they readily listened and both homes bought the .set of volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We shall be glad to hear from workers, especially of their success in placing the Deliverance book, the obstacles they are meeting, and particularly outlining the method of canvass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With Christian greetings, we are</span></p>

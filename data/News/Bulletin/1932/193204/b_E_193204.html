<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Care for the Kingdom Interests </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Have You Attained </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Youb Quota? </span><span class="font2">Or Jfaylie </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Yom</span><span class="font2"> Are Ahead </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of Your G-Month Schedule</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THOSE WHO KNOW JEHOVAH will be anxious to know how they are progressing In their use of the Kingdom interests. “Have I reached Half of my quota?” is w-bnt the calendar for April calls to our attention. Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses undoubtedly will have this in mind. It is impossible to consider anything pertaining to the Kingdom interests at this season without hav-, ing in mind Thanksgiving, for not only have the anointed received a new name that the mouth of Jehovah himself has named, but they also have spring and fall holidays which Jehovah has designated as periods of time for praising his name. In addition to this we have a clearer understanding of the Memorial feast than ever before. We now see it as a feast prepared by Jehovah for his anointed at this time; a feast of joy and praise: and in addition to all this, the Lord has been pleased to unfold the 68th Psalm to the publishers of the name of Jehovah In a manner that brings unspeakable joy to each one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As we consider these many blessings which have come, to us during the past few months, surely all of the anointed will gratefully acknowledge that they have much to be thankful for; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font2">thanksgiving, like faith and love, if it is without works, is dead. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font2">thanksgiving that is mere words or a sentimental feeling means nothing. Thanksgiving, to be a real thing, must live. In the Old Testament the word thanksgiving means acclamation or shouting with singing and confession or sacrifice of praise. It embodies the thought and establishes the fact that the truly thankful at this time will proclaim and confess the praises </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">Jehovah and do this in a practical manner according lo his arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each pioneer, auxiliary, company worker and sharpshooter has undoubtedly set a quota for the year. 'They determined by the Lord's grace to give so many testimonies to his praise during the year. Half of this year Is past. Have I reached half of my quota? If not, why not? Am I not devoting sufficient time to the service? Have I let something else creep in and absorb the time that I expected and told the Lord I hoped to use in the field service? Have sickness, weather conditions or some other unavoidable circumstances interrupted my schedule? These are only a few of the many things which might have been responsible for not keeping up with our quoin. The point is, however, if after careful and prayerful consideration last October we planned that by the Lord’s grace we would endeavor to attain a certain quota arid rw we find half the year gone ami we an<sup>1 </sup>not keeping up with it, there must</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">be some reason for this, and as stewards of the mysteries of God who must be found faithful, each one should examine himself, his time, and other circumstances that affect his Kingdom service and endeavor to find out what is causing this condition, and then take the necessary steps to overcome such obstacles, that he may pay his vows unto the Lord now in the presence of his people. Not only should we endeavor to keep up to our quota from this time forward, but we should endeavor by the-Lord’s grace to make up any shortage, and, if possible, to exceed our quota by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is a Thanksgiving that manifests itself in a really practical way. IL manifests an Intense inlflrest in the responsibility that the Lord has been pleased to place upon the people, and an endeavor to carry out and fulfil our vows unto the Lord regardless of anything the Devil or anybody else may do to stop it. It is evident to everyone that the Lord does not want any of his people to come short in the Kingdom work, aud that if they do their part he will undoubtedly help them to at-</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">(*) Note; The 14.44 hours additional each week put in by these 10 outstanding pioneers means that in the course of a month they each devote -u.76 hours more to the work than the average pioneer, or that they work almost 12 five-hour days more eacli month than the average pioneer. And this additional effort put forth in the Lord's service is what has increased their efficiency so that they are able to place 3.38 books per hour, while the average pioneer is able to place but .646 or two-thirds of a book an hour. While these ten place literature with one out of every two persons testified to, the average pioneer places literature with but one person out of every four receiving the testimony.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Following Is Offered for Consideration</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Findings Are:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The summary below shows results | accomplished during the month of February by ten pioneer witnesses. Notice that the average of literature placed by these ten faith Oil witnesses was 494 clol.libound books and 208 booklets. They devoted an average of 146.8 hours to the actual door-to-door witnessing for the entire month, which means an average of 36,7 hours per- week. February is a fair month from which to figure such an average, because as a winter month it presents hindrances in the way of cold, rainy, unfavorable weather, and the roads are in bad condition because of ihe mud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is worthy of note that these brethren averaged more than two to one in bound-book placements as compared with booklets. Indeed, many of Ihe booklets they did place were along with sets of clothbound hooks. The special point of interest</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">is, How do they do it? The answer may be found by examining the number of hours they devote to the work of going from door to door telling the people concerning Jehovah God and his kingdom. They averaged over 36 hours per week, and some devoted almost 50 hours per week; and thus it is to be scon that where the brethren really devote themselves fully to the pioneer service, meeting the time requirements, the Lord richly blesses their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During February the average pioneer devoted 22 i hours per week to the service, and these 10 brethren, by putting in an average of 36 hours per week, really worked a week and two-thirds while the other pioneers were doing one week’s work. Additionally, because of the long horn's they are devoting to the field work, thoir placements arc largely increased as, through regular daily work, their efficiency in the Lord’s service is much greater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The often-asked question, &quot;How may I place more literature?” may be answered, First, by devoting more time to the house-to-house work. Comparing the work of these ten brethren with the work of the pioneers as a whole, it will be seen that these ten give the same number of testimonies per hour but that their placements per hour are double. In other words, they place literature with almost twice as many people per hour, and more than five times as many volumes of clothbound literature per hour. It Is noticed that these ten pioneers placed literature with practically one-half the number of people to whom they delivered the testimony, whereas the average pioneer places literature with less than one-fourth of the people testified to, or one out of four. The number of books placed per hour by these ten workers is approximately five times as large as that placed by the average pioneer. This may be explained by the fact tiiat these ten placed literature in sets of 10 cloth books, or in sets of 9 and 7, where the people already hail some </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the literature, and in many, many instances sets of four bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fact that these ten pioneers left a greater number of sets of bound books with the people shows that in delivering the testimony they arouse a greater interest on the part of the obtuiner than ordinarily is done, ami thus by placing more literature they enlarge the scope of the witness to the honor of (Continued on page 2, column 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">What’s the matter with the weather man? That is the question the pioneers are asking. Country which is supposed to be warm in the winter has frozen up during the last few weeks, and in territory where ice and snow should have come months ago, winter arrived </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ho</span><span class="font2"> late it is meeting spring. This unusual state of affairs surprises, but does not discourage Jehovah’s pioneer witnesses. A terrific storm started nt the Gulf, and swept over Alabama. most of Tennessee and Kentucky, and reached into Georgia and North Carolina. Many of our brethren are pioneering in this territory, and we certainly hope they are not in any way injured. The pioneers’ solution to unusual weather conditions is not in pulling up camp and striking off to the other side of the country, hut by thoroughly covering the -assignments they hold before proceeding </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">the next, if this is at all possible. Frequent, long trips are expensive, result in a loss of time, and are oftentimes unnecessary. Experienced pioneers are planning their work to do away with these as much as possible. If you are in the southeastern part of the country it is not necessary to go all the way </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">the Northwest to find a place to work. Those who are contemplating pioneer territory may be near </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">field offering greater opportunities than a section many hundreds of miles away.</span></p>

What is true of the individual, of course, is true of tbe company, and tbe examination outlined above tor each individual should be made by the director and service committee of each company. They should check up on the progress of the company’s activity; see if they are keeping up with their quota ; ascertain why they have not, if they are short, anil, with the cooperation of the entire company, plan ways and means of overcoming the handicaps und making up the shortage, that they may be found faithful stewards of the mysteries of God. However, we do not want to create the impression that all or even a. majority of the friends are behind in their quota as they reach the half-way mark for the year, but rather, we took up the negative side of the question first in order to help those who are behind to overcome their obstacles and take the necessary steps to attaining their goal. The fact that one is keeping up or is ahead of his quota at the present time, and if he keeps up the same ratio will finish considerably ahead at the end of the year, should be no reason for his slacking his hands and letting down now, for that is really what the Lord tells us we should expect lie says that if we try him, and bring the tithes into the storehouse, he will open the heavens and pour out a blessing upon us such as we shall be unable to hold; which, in itself, indicates that when we set our quota at the beginning of the year it Is with the highest expectations. If we put forth the effort to serve him, the Lord is going to reward our faith to such an extent that at the end of the year it: will exceed that which when we started out we hardly hoped would be possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let all, therefore, examine themselves Individually and collectively and see how they arc progressing in keeping up with their quota as a practical means of manifesting their real thanksgiving and appreciation unto Jehovah,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Suggestions Regarding Freight Shipments</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">There arc many small companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries who are located in small towns where there are no railroad stations, but they do receive mail at these points. We should appreciate it if all friends who are located at such points would give us the name of the nearest railroad depot when ordering books, as well as their mail address. There are still many towns in this country through which railroads do not pass, but to which mail service is provided. Therefore, when we make a freight shipment we must know which railroad town is nearest the place where you are located.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Unclaimed Shipments</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Several times a week we receive notice from the railroads stating that certain shipments are unclaimed by the consignees. Such notices usually state that the consignee cannot he located or that the consignee fails to respond to postal notices. We urge that all call for their shipments promptly upon arrival or arrange to have someone call and claim them. Remember that storage starts on a shipment 48 hours after its arrival at the depot. If you are unable to claim the shipment within two days, notify the freight agent, so that he may know what to do with the shipment. In tire ease of pioneers leaving a territory and there Is an order on the way to the point you ai-e leaving, please make arrangements witii the freight agent regarding forwarding the shipment, before you leave. Failure to do so has left some of the workers without literature.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>It Is a Good Thing to Carry a Bible While Witnessing</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the field workers have found that the No. 218 Bible has been u. help to them In placing the books. It has been possible in the past month to reduce the rate to the pioneer, auxiliary and company workers on this Bible. It is recommended that, whenever people desire a Bible, this Bible be offered to them at $1.50, the offer to include two of our own clothbound books. In this way you will be disposing of the books that explain the Bible, We suggest that the Bible never be offered for a dollar, but for $1.50, and that the two books be given as a premium. In a previous </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font2">it was recommended that the friends always curry a Bible with them in their work so that in ease of arrest or trouble it can be said that we are offering Bibles to the people as well as Bible helps.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">TERRITORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The success of these brethren is not because they have any better territory than the other pioneers, since they do not. Some of these ten are working in the North, some in the South ; some are witnessing in business districts exclusively, some are chiefly in rural districts (including the small towns in their assignments), and some are working amongst forcigu-spcaking people. Bui. wherever they are working, these ten pioneers are thoroughly covering their territory und seeing to it that every one in it receives the testimony, and they are not merely skimming over it and covering that which is easily accessible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CONTRIBUTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many brethren say they are unable to place literature because people have no money. These ten pioneers, along with ninny others, are overcoming this obstacle by accepting contributions of such things as chickens, eggs, butter, vegetables, preserved fruit and vegetables, cornmeal, meat, and (when witnessing tn stores) clothing, wearing apparel; also repairs to clothing and shoes, barbering services, laundry work, in fact, anything that a pioneer can use or dispose of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following letter from one of these ten shows his method of broaching the matter of accepting produce:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Eighty to ninety percent of the books we have placed would not have been placed if we had not taken produce. Onr placements are not due to any great, salesmanship or any peculiar way of carrying or displaying the books. We find it best in most cases in approaching the people of the South, in the rurals especially, to introduce ourselves by name and shake hands, upon which we are usually invited in the house. This “breaks the ice&quot;' and the witness can be given more effectively. It is best, if possible, to get the man and wife together before witnessing, as it is usually by mutual agreement that the books arc taken. Much time is lost if two testimonies have to be given to the same family before they decide whether or not they will take the books. When witnessing in the rurals, where we are pretty sure that produce will have to be taken, after delivering the testimony, we broach the subject something like this : ‘Now, Mrs. Jones, how much do you think tills library of books would cost?' (Mrs, Jones: 'Well, according to school books, tliey would cost eight or ten dollars.’) ‘Most people judge them to be that, but are usually surprised to find that our work is not selling books, but preaching tbe gospel. Wo don’t need your money; we arc just volunteers in this work to help inform others of Jehovah God’s purposes, and the work is carried on largely by voluntary contributions. Some contribute more than others, according to their means, but anyone contributing $2.50 receives this entire set of 10 books. The way many of your neighbors got the books was by contributing heus. Three good-sized hens are all that are required.’ At this point I usually mention some other interesting feature about the books lu order to give them a few seconds to decide, Then I suggest that they read a certain book first and can start iu Tight away to enjoy the hooks. Sometimes it is well to mention someone else in the neighborhood who exchanged chickens for the books, for people are prone to do as tbe other fellow does. It is really remarkable to see In some cases the people pick up three hens out of a yard of only six or seven lu order to get the books containing the Kingdom message. In many eases we come down to a hen for two books, and the people are glad to accept. We al ways try to leave a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font2"> booklet in every home, and if they havwi’t a nickel, we take a few eggs or a little cornmeal, or some vegetables which we can use. We push the bound books instead of tbe booklets, and therefore place many more. We find it easier to place a bound book for thirty cents than to place several booklets. When we have stores to work we try to exchange the books for such articles as wo need. Sometimes it is groceries, or, again, it may be a shirt, some socks, or a. pair of shoes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many pioneers report that: they dispose of their produce to the best advantage by shipping the chickens, eggs, etc., by coop or crate into markets in near-by large cities, aud by disposing of their preserved fruit and vegetables in large towns in their territory, to restaurants that buy in larger quantities than single households would, by offering it to pie-baking establishments, etc.; also, some state that they dispose of much of their foodstuffs to the people who run the lodging or boarding houses in which liiey live. Pioneers in one general vicinity sometimes join together in making shipments of their chickens, etc., to market and thus save considerable expense and trouble, due to larger and more frequent shipments than one pioneer alone could make.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This summary of the work of these ten pioneers is published that the brethren may see what it is possible for pioneers to accomplish when they really devote their full time to the work, and that the many brethren who are just taking up the pioneer work may see what they may hope to accomplish in the Lord's service. This should be of the greatest encouragement to the Lord’s witnesses because it will demonstrate to them upon which points they must strive to increase their own efficiency in the Lord’s work. It reveals that each witness should see to it that be takes the utmost advantage of the calls he makes, properly presenting the testimony in such manner that It wilt result in delivering the printed testimony to the recipient in the form of books and booklets. The most successful pioneers find that the bearing of the. witness and his manner of presenting the testimony are. of the greatest importance. It is essential for each witness to keep continually in mind that he is commissioned by Jehovah to bear this message to tiic people, and see to it that his tone of voice, manner and expression are in keeping therewith. Of course, Jehovah’s witnesses will not act in a pious, sanctimonious manner, but ns befitting the representatives of tbe Most High God, delivering the testimony in calmness and confidence and with enthusiasm. The purpose behind the efforts of the pioneers is to honor the name of Jehovah, and it is to further that purpose that the.se suggestions are made.</span></p>

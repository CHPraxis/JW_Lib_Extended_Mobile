<p><span class="font2">The Scriptures refer to the Lord’s anointed as a ‘great company of publishers’, publishers of the word of Jehovah which Jie gives Io them. This publishing is also referred to as ‘singing psalms'. The March 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch to we r</span><span class="font2"> gives us si beautiful and descriptive exp Inn at ion of Ibis work, taken from the meaning of the word &quot;song” or &quot;psalm”; minstrelsy, or strolling from place to place, making music along the way; publishing or singing from house to house the praises of Jehovah’s name ami kingdom. This picture carries the thought of deliverance, freedom from encumbrances, with only the one work ot singing, and beautifully depicts the attitude of Jehovah's witnesses who arc wholly devoted to him at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The International Thanksgiving Testimony Period provides a wonderful opportunity for Jehovah s witnesses throughout the earth to publish and sing songs to the praise of Jehovah in this maimer. Going amongst all people in every land at the same time, Jehovah’s witnesses are found raising the voice and will) 1he voice together singing and publishing the praises of his name ami his kingdom. The fact that this period commences with the day on which Memorial is held Ibis year gives an added solemnity arid importance to the entire event. It enables us to appreciate more than ever the importance of the fact that the Lord has returned and, in addition to showing forth his death, it is now the privilege of God’s anointed to sing to the vindication of Jehovah’s name- and the establishment of Ills kingdom. Every one who possibly can, therefore, should see to it that be has sonic part in tins glorious song that will rise from the coasts ot the earth at this time, and determine that the song then commenced shall never end until every vestige of the Devil’s organization tlmt now beclouds the name and purposes of Jehovah is entirely removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We find that there arc certain specific requirements for this work laid down by the Lord in his Word which are called to our attention in the same March 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watc.hloicer </span><span class="font2">and which emphasize the fact flint this singing and publishing the praises of Jehovah cannot be done in a strange place. The place of the anointed is on Mount Zion, the hill of Megiddo, with the assembly of the Lord’s troops. Those who are not there are in a strange land, and consequently are more or less nndei’ or subjected io the Influences of ILL enemy. The kind of singing, the manner of singing and (lie amount of singing those In that position do are limited and subjected to the desires of the enemy. Such cannot he (Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>44</sup> Thanksgiving Day”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As outlined in the February 15 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> the twenty-four hours commencing at &lt;5:00 p.m. on Sunday, March 20, until Hie same time the following day, should be celebrated as a thanksgiving day unto Jehovah God. Tlmt being true, every one of Jehovah's witnesses l.hrmigh-otit the earth will want to use this period to tlie glory of Jehovah. The Scriptures tell us that faith without works is dead; likewise thanksgiving that is merely a matter of words does not manifest a great deal. Where the heart is truly thankful and grateful to Jehovah, the creature is desirous of manifesting tlmt in reel activity: and undoubtedly all of the anointed appreciate Jehovah's goodness as never iK.'fore, and the privilege that is theirs of having some part in the vindication of his word and name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Therefore we believe it would be pleasing to Jehovah for every one who can possibly do so to take this day off from his secular employment and use it exclusively in tlie vindication of Jehovah's name. That will permit Sunday, all day, just prior to the assembling for Memorial, to be used in the Lord’s service, ami (he following day, Monday, to be similarly used, ’[’lie service committee of each company should make arrangements for extensive service activities during these two days and for a service declaration meeting on Monday evening where the goodness of Jehovah and the blessed privilege that has been the portion of the anointed during the pnsl, two days may be considered and discussed and real thanksgiving offered to Jehovah.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">International Thanksgiving Testimony Period Reports </span><span class="font2">All tlie directors, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries in the United States should make a special effort, to get. their reports for the eight, days of service, in early. Remember that this report includes March 20, Sunday, to March 27, also Sunday. Tlie report for the previous week should be made out ending with Saturday's work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not only are the workers in the United States sending in a report to the office, but nil rhe branches throughout the world lire making a special elTon to gather Uieir reports from till of their workers and they will then send a report covering (he entire country to the Brooklyn ofliee so that :t tabuIal.ion can be imide for the entire International Thanksgiving Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This will be a great event, with all of tlie Lord’s anointed everywhere pul ting forrli a special effort to honor liis name in the earth. It will truly be a thanksgiving period for the remnant.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Arrange to Have Time, Territory and Literature</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The February 15 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">contains a very wonderful article on the Memorial and shows the proper date for Its observance this year as after 6 p.m. of March 20. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also appoints</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">that as a day of thanksgiving specially set aside for the Lord’s people, to be spent in thanksgiving unto Jehovah God. and as the beginning of a period to be known as International Thanksgiving Testimony Period which will continue until 3larch 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Clearly such arrangement for a Thanksgiving Day mid period of bearing testimony is from tlie Lord, ami is another manifestation of His loving-kindness toward bis people. Everywhere the brethren are rejoicing ami considering how they may take the fullest advantage of this gift from the Lord. How different is this Thanksgiving Day from the holidays arranged by the Devil’s crowd! The world’s holidays are for the purpose of selfish enjoyment and dissipation. The Thanksgiving period arranged by Jehovah is for an utterly unselfish purpose, ami manifests his loving-kindness toward his creatures. The Lord’s anointed people will spend this ported as Jehovah would have fliem, bearing kingdom fruits to the people, singing fori h his praises, and rendering joyful thanksgiving to his great and holy name. Jehovah 1ms prepared a feast for his anointed people, and it is their happy lot to bo privileged to carry this food to the distressed, heartsick, oppressed ones of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The hand of tlie Lord is manifested also in the arrangement of the lime for tlie observance of the Memorial. It Is after 6 p.m. of March 20, on Sunday, when the brethren everywhere have a day free from their usual workday duties, and will be able to turn themselves whole-heartedly Into the observance of Jehovah’s Thanksgiving Period. Through the columns of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The. Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Jehovah has taught his people that the observance of the Memorial now is not a sorrowful occasion, but that they are partaking of the wine new wiili the Lord in’the kingdom. (Matt. 26:28, 29) It is an occasion for joy and thanksgiving tlmt now they are privileged to have a part with Christ Jesus in the vindication of the great name of Jehovah, How better could the day of March 20, preceding the Memorial ceremony in the evening, be spent than in the service singing the sung of praise to Jehovah God, and bearing Kingdom fruits to the people In their homes? There is no more fitting way of using that day than by Inking the message which Jehovah has provided and joyfully obeying his command by declaring it to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord's anointed people will gladly seize the occasion for actually participating in the drinking of the “wine&quot;, and, their hearts being made glad, they will share their joy with the meek of the earth. (Matt. 20: 22, 23) Am), too, the message of warning may he delivered even to the rebellious house of Israel. (Ezek. 2:3-10; 3; 17-27) Thus may the obligation laid upon the anointed be discharged and they stand guiltless before the Lord.—Isa, 12:1-C; 43: 8-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order that the anointed may lift up their voices in a harmonious song, it is suggested tlmt a combination of four of the elothbound books be used during the International Thanksgiving Testimony Period. Probably </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font2"> bearing the timely warning of imminent destruction upon so-called .^Christendom”, along with the two books </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font2">which give so much information concerning the activities of the &quot;beauts”, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font2"> to round out the message, would constitute a very attractive offer. The Lord prepared the message contained in these books, and has'placed it in the hands of his anointed; and now lie has provided a period of time in which they may joyfully bear this message to the people. Truly the hearts of the anointed indite a song of praise to the great Jehovah God when they consider the gracioustiess of his ways, and his oft-manifested loving-kindnesses. And now Jehovah has provided a practical outlet that his people may demonstrate their gratitude mid prove their obedience during this International Thanksgiving Testimony Period, even as in olden times he provided such occasions for his covenant people. (Nehemiah, 8th chapter)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How thou may the anointed prepare for the coming of this joyful occasion? By seeing that they are prepared to go forth unitedly in bearing testimony, that (hey have a supply of the literature on hand ready to present to the people, that they have an assignment of territory suitable for the occasion and sufficient to last them during the whole period, and that they have the Testimony ready to deliver to the people. Also, they may prepare additionally by discharging in advance all their usual obligations that would ordinarily require attention during that week, and thus leave them as free as possible to devote their time and attention to the real purpose of their existence, the vindication of the name of Jehovah, Above all, after having carefully planned and arranged their efforts in advance, let the anointed unitedly take the matter in prayer to the great Jehovah that his hless-(Continued on page 2, column 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">It affords us mneli joy mid considerable food for thought to present; at this time the results of the Bound Book Testimony Period compared with Hie Midwinter Week and Prophecy Week covering the same periods of time for 1931 and 1930 respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Throughout the entire analysis the stately stepping of our God is manifest. marching grandly on to victory, unaffected by earthly conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Buri ng the Bound Book Testimony Period there were well over half a million testimonies given in the United States, an increase of almost 134,000 over the similar period of last year. Prom the standpoint of the magnitude of the witness, this is truly the Lord’s doing. Likewise with the placements. Over 111,20(1 people received the Kingdom message in book form, compared with 87,934 hist year and 74,804 the year before. Within a period of two years there has been an increase of 30,398 homes receiving the literature during these special periods. Even in the most prosperous times we never had anything like this in the vmy of an increase—49 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Continued from page 1, column 1) pleasing to Jehovah, The Kingdom is here. We are not advancing to it, but wc are actually in the service of the King. We are in the army, charging the enemy, and this is no time for compromise of any sort. Soldiers in the army engaged in actual lighting do not have to stop to figure out whether they are in the array or not. Wc are either on the hill of Megiddo, the hill of Jehovah's troops, or else we are not there. If </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ojl</span><span class="font2"> investigation it is found that for any reason one cannot sing and publish the name and kingdom of Jehovah now to the extent of his ability, it is a strong indication that he is in a strange land and that his instruments of praise, instead of being used as the Lord dictates, are hanging uselessly on the willow tree. There is no just reason why anyone who claims to be God’s anointed should be in this condition now. The Lord has arranged for the deliverance of his people. He has accomplished it; he has provided them with the necessary ammunition ; he has placed his Captain in charge and has commanded his people to go forward. He has guaranteed that his army shall be victorious and that those who will have part in this victory must be called, chosen and faithful. Therefore let each one as he participates in this warfare, and particularly at the beginning of this Thanksgiving Testimony Period and Memorial, examine himself, for this question deserves careful consideration by each one of Jehovah’s witnesses; end what more appropriate time for self-examination than at the present? We should examine ourselves to see whether we are partaking of the Memorial worthily and whether we really discern the body. Those who know Jehovah will partake worthily, by properly discerning the Lord’s re</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Consideration of the literature placed is also encouraging. The number of bound books for 1931 and that for 1932 are practically the same, which is another remarkable evidence that the literature enn be placed regardless of the depression. There was a drop of almost 22,000 booklets, however, which firings the total literature down by that amonnl and indicates that tiie people are not taking the booklets in the larger combinations: but the fact that: the total, being 22,000 fewer pieces, was distributed to 23,268 more homes, is eloquent evidence of the ever increasing desire of the people for the Kingdom message. And aside from the command of Jehovah and the vindication of his word and name, this should be one of the greatest: impelling forces to draw all of the Lord’s people into his service; for only the truth cun bring hope, peace and joy to the poor groaning creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tiie increase in the number of workers is another positive evidence of the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses ore more and more realizing the obligation the Lord has placed upon quirements for the body now. They will, in the words of the psalmist, say with enthusiasm, “Como, let us slug unto the Loan; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. Lei. us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.” (Continued from page 1, column 4) jng may be upon 1he arrangements and effects, so that it may result in the greatest good toward the vindication of the name of Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus, being fully prepared for the occasion, when the hour comes, on Sunday, March 20, the anointed will be standing in readiness to go forth to the territory for which they are Individually responsible, and participate in the Thanksgiving feast which Jehovah has prepared. Never before has there been such an occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The great period of waiting having ended in 1914, Jehovah set his King upon his throne. (Ps. 110:1, 2; 2:6) He sent forth Michael to lead his forces against the enemy and east Satan out of heaven. (Revelation, 12th chapter) The time for rejoicing has come. (Rev. 12:12; Isa. 61 : 10) Jehovah has illuminated the minds of the anointed with the significance of the happenings since 1914, and now be has further blessed his anointed ones with an understanding of the true significance of the observance of the Memorial, and thus they arc prepared to properly participate in the celebration of the Memorial on this day of thanksgiving to Jehovah. Never before have tlie anointed partaken of the Memorial under such joyful, happy conditions. This is tlie Lord’s doing, and so let the anointed show their heartfelt appreciation during this International Thanksgiving Testimony Period by unitedly lifting up their them as a part of his servant and are responding to it with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The one point which does not show up well is the time spent in the service. Every branch shows a decided drop in the number of hours per worker. There was a 14-pcrcent drop in the t.otal, without any apparent reason for it. Some idea of what this means in the magnitude of the witness may be obtained when we take 14 percent of the testimonies, hours, placements, books and booklets and consider them. Here is what, it; would mean ; 72,422 more testimonies, 15,494 more hours, 15,598 more placements, 8,662 more books and 17.066 more booklets. Nothing can be done about this now, of course, but these figures emphasize the importance of watching the time. Let each one determine by the Lord’s grace not to be similarly overtaken in the Thanksgiving Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No effort has been made here to analyze the different departments, such as pioneers, auxiliaries or companies. We believe each one can do this for himself. We considered here the remnant in the United States as a unit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Much time is wasted looking up addresses which time could be better spent in the Lord’s service. Again it is requested that each one writing a letter or sending an order he SURE that his name and COMPLETE address appear in a prominent place on the letter or order. The name of your city alone is insufficient : so kindly put your street address or post office box number on each communication. If your address is General Delivery, kindly so indicate. Your compliance with this request will be greatly appreciated, since it will expedite the work in the Society’s office.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The Bethel family, of course, will be privileged to spend tlie first Sunday in the service with tlie brethren everywhere, before they partake of the Memorial that evening. In addition to this, it. has been arranged for the factory to be closed the Saturday before the last day of this period, March 26, so that they will have an opportunity to spend two full days at the end of Hits period in .the field giving testimony to the Lord’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All companies within a radius of 300 miles from Brooklyn who would like to have a service leader serve them on the 26tli and 27th should write in early to the Regional Serv-</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>A Suggestion to Considei’</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">In many instances pioneers leave the literature with people in exchange for produce and foodstuffs, such as chickens, eggs, milk, preserved fruits, canned vegetables, etc. To aid the pioneers in turning these into cash with which to pay their necessary expenses, one company has arranged a section in their meeting place where these things taken in exchange are placed by the pioneers, and tlie members of the company purchase such at reasonable market values. This saves tire time of the pioneers, since ordinarily they must lake the produce to market anti dispose of it. It also works to tiie advantage of those purchasing, since they get good, fresh country producls at proper prices. The brethren everywhere must buy various articles of food, and it is suggested that. this arrangement, wliieli is reported as working very satisfactorily, could be undertaken by other companies where there are pioneers working in their vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Folders and Back Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The new radio folder has proved very effective, and many people arc listening in liecause they have received these iinnonnceuients. It is well to leave these with all the people you meet, so that more will be informed concerning the immense number of radio transcription programs that are put on in tiie United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tiie back calls on those who write in to the office for literature or further informal ion have proved ■scry successful. Workers toll us that quite often when they have made a back call they have'left an entire set of ten books, as well as many booklets. These back calls ore very encouraging and should he taken care of as soon as you receive the slip from the office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We would recommend that, whenever pioneers are in a company territory, the director give these slips to them if they desire to make the back calls. This will aid them somewhat in their expenses, because if may he that they can place a set of hooks, and this will be of help !o them. Instead of giving the back call slips to tlie company workers or even those who do not go out regularly, it is preferable to give tlrem to the pioneers in your territory if they can conveniently make the calls. Otherwise, active workers should fake care of these immediately, so that the witness may be properly presented and literature left with the interested parties.</span></p>

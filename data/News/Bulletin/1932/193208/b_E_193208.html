<p><span class="font1">TESTIMONIES TO DATE, 11,329,280</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>THOSE WHO KNOW JEHOVAH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Delight to Declare His Judgments</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The psalmist says, “The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether”; and, “to execute upon them [his] judgment written : this honour have all his saints.” We now see clearly the great Executor of Jehovah in action. He is driving rapidly to the destruction of the King’s enemies and the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah served due notice of Ills judgments upon Ahab regarding the destruction of his house and what would befall all his posterity. In the prophecy of Ezekiel this judgment of Jehovah is subdivided and applied to the component parts of the Devil's organization. Those of the anointed who have read </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">catimi</span><span class="font1"> Book 2 now know what is meant by the statement “Son of man, prophesy” concerning ‘the Atnorites, the Edomites, the Moabites, the Zldonians, Philistines, Tyrus and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and all Egypt’. This is their commission and authority to act. It is a definite command to each one to deliver the judgments that the Ixjrd has written. Those who have not read </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication- 2</span><span class="font1"> had better get ready and read it immediately, because it contains the latest and clearest exposition of our commission from Jehovah, It gives us details regarding the work the Lord requires of his people now as never before revealed. Therefore, all who are honestly desirous of faithfully and speedily carrying out their commission must speedily and diligently study their commission in its latest setting. There is no time to waste. Get busy now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Having studied your commission and obtained a panoramic vision of the activities of Jehovah’s army, visible and invisible, under the antitypical Jehu, no power on earth can restrain the truly anointed from taking his position in the ranks and going forward to absolute victory. To take our position in the ranks, then, the first step necessary to consider is the time devoted to the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There arc still many of the consecrated who are not devoting the time they should and could to the Lord’s service. Many who are out of employment spend days and weeks and months chasing back and forth through the Devil’s house and field looking there for creature comforts. Jesus says, ‘Forget the Devil’s house and the comforts it has to offer, and let those who are in Judea flee into the mountain, into God’s mountain or kingdom,’ Again he says, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unlo you.” Therefore let each one examine himself before the Lord and in the light of the Kingdom truth now revealed and then attach himself to the ranks of the Lord’s advancing army,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>English Booklets 5c</span></h2>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Beginning with August 1, 6 for 25c, 13 for 50c</span></h5>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Six New Booklets Now Ready</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">In the July 15 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> the announcement was made of the six new booklets written by Brother Rutherford; and these new ones will be a real encouragement to the friends. They arc beautiful. The contents—well, read them and see how short and to the point the treatises are in which the conclusions are arrived at and proved. These will be a wonderful means to help the people to take their stand on Jehovah’s side. Due to the hard times, unemployment and oppression among the people, Brother Rutherford has decided to reduce the amount asked for these booklets to 5c a copy, any six for 25c, or thirteen for 50c. Isn’t that just fine? These amounts asked apply to the Hnglish booklets only, and include such booklets as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crimes and Calamities,</span><span class="font1"> Wop or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peace, Heaven and Purgatory, Prohibition,</span><span class="font1"> and others in the English language, as long as the present supply lasts. The foreign-language booklets will still be 10c for one, two for 15c, four for 25c. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> booklet in foreign languages remains the same as in English, namely, five cents a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">'The names of these new booklets alone will cause immediate interest, and it is believed that these booklets will move most rapidly. The Society is printing 250,000 of each one to start with, and will try hard to keep these in stock. There arc also seven more booklets to be prepared for the field. The Lord surely keeps ins people supplied with new things to offer to the nations as a witness to God’s kingdom which will bring about the complete vindication of his name and word.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">with everything he has. Don’t he satisfied with maintaining the standard of the past, and do not compare your results with the accomplishments of some other brother or sister. I,et the Lord be your standard, and submit yourself to him. The judgments of the Lord against the different branches of the Devil’s organization, revealed in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> books, are now due to be delivered l&gt;y the Lord’s anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tli ere fore, the inaugural </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> Testimony Period, September 3 to 5, should see everyone in the field at least five hours a day, Tho majority of those who are still in secular employment will be released from such duties during this period. Let each one, then, delight himself in Jehovah by declaring his judgments particularly during this period, but do not let your delight terminate when the period is over. Continue declaring his judgments until the whole Devil's city is laid waste and not an inhabitant left therein to profane the name of Jehovah.</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Three “Vindication” Books for 75c</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Declaration Against the Devil</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">these two new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> books</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Workers Will Be Supplied with Special Wrappers</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">In order that the people may know that a very special offer is being made for three days only, the Society is supplying a special wrapper free to all workers. We hope that these wrappers will be used and the three </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> books will be stressed during the three-day period September 3, 4, and 5. Every worker should be able to put in considerable time, due to the holiday, on Labor Day. Many of the friends will have that day off from regular work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When shipment is made of these wrappers, they will be consigned on the basis of three wrappers for each company worker, for the auxiliaries four, and for the pioneers six wrappers, These, of course, will be used only during the tliree-day period. After the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> Testimony Period, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> books will be 30c each, or, when Included in a dollar combination, four bound books for $1.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Everyone should make arrangements now to put In as many hours as he possibly can. The message in will make anyone who loves the Lord want to place them with the people.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">New Radio Folders</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Everyone May Have Them at 65c per Thousand</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Due to the fact that these new radio folders are now printed on a little cheaper paper, we can reduce the cost to the friends. They can now he had at 65e per thousand, and this applies to everyone, whether the order is for a large or for a small quantity. If the person orders a thousand or if he orders ten thousand, the charge will be at the same rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where pioneers are working In company territory, we hope that the companies can supply radio folders free to the pioneers in their territory, Those pioneers who are isolated may order what they need, and radio folders will be supplied free by the Society. All the territory in the United States should be covered with radio folders in the regular door-to-door witness, so that all the people will have an opportunity to know of these timely lectures given by Brother Rutherford.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Combine Shipments to Same Address It Will Save Something </span><span class="font1">In some cities there are a number of pioneer and auxiliary witnesses. It is not always convenient for each of these to order in shipments of 100 pounds or more. Therefore it is suggested that if these brethren will confer with one another and arrange to send in their orders at one time these will be shipped in</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1">one large shipment and thus a saving be effected in shipping charges and cost of handling, both at this end and nt the destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Orders should be sent in together in the names of the various individuals, end will be charged here to the differenl pioneers and auxiliaries. They will be .shipped as one large shipment, but the orders for the various pioneers and auxiliaries will be so packed in cartons that they will be kept separate.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">By the time most friends receive this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">KitUelin,</span><span class="font1"> the remnant will be well into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> Two and Three. And wlmt a treat they have had! Never has the Lord provided his people with so much food as he has at the present time. It is food convenient for them because they now see their privilege to press on in their service for Jehovah and his kingdom. Such a clear understanding of the Devil’s organization and its wicked works makes everyone of them determined to fight for Jehovah and against ihe Devil. For an understanding of Gog and the land of Magog, Jehu as Jehovah’s executioner, and his great slaughter work, and then that wonderful portion in Book Tiinee, of Ezekiel’s vision of Jehovah’s temple, Jehovah’s witnesses give thanks. God loves his people, and his people show forth their love and unselfish devotion to him by their works. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> Testimony 1’eriod will give every one a splendid opportunity to do this.</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL REPORT CARD for September 3 to 5 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Vindication</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Testimony Period”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All companies, sharpshooters, pioneers arid auxiliaries are to make out a special report card covering their activities during these THREE DAYS, September 3 to 5. The activities so reported arc NOT to be included on any other report card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This THREE DAYS’ report is to be made out on one of the regular cards you now have on band, and this special report should be headed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Vindication</span><span class="font1"> Teslimony Beriod”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As there is no designated place on the present cards for reporting </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> Book 2 and Book 3, the placements of these two books are to he shown on the bottom part of the card. Please be sure to show separately how many </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindioation-</span><span class="font1">Book 2 and how many </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">VindicationBook</span><span class="font1"> 3 have been placed ; do not add them together under one heading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The other parts of the card arc to be made out ns usual.</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses Greatly Privileged</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Times Are Hard, but Remnant Are Only Ones with Comfort</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reports from all parts of the country show that the people are in a very bad way financially, and even suffering for lack of food; consequently they are in great distress menially. They are greatly desirous of knowing whence their relief Is to come, Jehovah’s witnesses enjoy the great privilege and responsibility of delivering the testimony to the people under these very favorable circumstances. Of course, the fact that the people are short of money will be offered as an excuse, but their realization of their own helpless condition affords such a favorable occasion for testifying to them that it more than makes up for bad financial conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Heretofore people in rural conditions have been less hard hit by conditions than those in the cities, but now the farmers too are suffering, They are faced with the likelihood of losing their homes and farms through inability to pay mortgage interest and taxes, and they are receiving little or no return for tlie crops they labor hard to raise. These conditions prevailing cause Jehovah's witnesses to rejoice, and to press on with renewed determination to honor the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The question might be raised, flow long can the witness work continue in the face of such conditions? The answer is that Jehovah long ago commanded that the witness should he given at this time, and under the very conditions now existing and during the events that are taking place today. It is evident that he will supply the means and provide for the continuance and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">increase</span><span class="font1"> of the promulgation of the Kingdom message &quot;until the cities be wasted without inhabitant&quot;. It is true that tlie faithful servants of old died in Jehovah’s service, but there is no word in the record that indicates they starved to death for want of the necessities of life. Jeliova.fi provided for carrying on the work he gave them to do. If he sustained them, may it not be confidently expeeled, then, that he will sustain those whom these faithful men of old pictured or represented? Jehovah not alone provides the necessities for the sustenance of life to his anointed, but he is now' supplying wonderfully refreshing truths to inspire and encourage them in the work he has given them to do. Jehovah's witnesses have every reason to be encouraged and to look for the witness to widen in scope rather than to cease. Let each one look with utmost confidence and trust to Jehovah, and press on with zeal and enthusiasm in the work Jehovah has commanded his servant to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A COMPLAINT</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recently the Uni fed States Post Office Department sent a complaint io the Society stating that our “circulars”, radio folders, were found in the mail Imxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Please bear in mind that all mail receptacles are provided for the Post Office Department for the depositing of mail by letter carriers and their use is restricted to the United Stales’ mails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When distributing radio folders or oilier free literature, if you ore unable to deliver personally, lie sure to put the literature under the door or fasten it somewhere so that It can be seen and picked up by the resident; do not put it in the mail boxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Maybe You Can Use Some Canned Goods</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is suggested that an opportunity of service may be enjoyed by regional service directors, company directors and oilier brethren attending service conventions. This is to cooperate with the pioneer witnesses in that vicinity in disposing of the produce and other articles which they have accepted as contributions for the Kingdom message, and which they may bring to the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An except from a regional report tells of the disposition of canned goods contributed, and reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The pioneers came loaded with the spoil of battle. About 200 cans of fruit and vegetables had been received, and were offered to those who cannot put in full time. It was quickly disposed of at fair prices. This is a great help to the pioneers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Addi'esses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is again requested that each pioneer, auxiliary, director, company worker or sharpshooter, or any other of the brethren writing to the Society put his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">COMPLETE </span><span class="font1">address and also his name on each letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Most of the letters received do not have the writer’s address on them and it is necessary to stop and look it up. It is not enough to put your return address on the outside of the envelope. Please put it in a prominent place on the letter itself. The name of the town alone is not an address, but the exact mail address to which a reply may be mailed should appear on each aud every letter sent to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A surprisingly large amount of time is lost through having to look up addresses, and this could be obviated if </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">EACH ONE</span><span class="font1"> would write his whole address on every letter. Your cooperation will be greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rush Orders</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recently we have received many orders marked “Rush”. In fact so many of them are marked in tin's way that we wonder whether there is a real urgency and whether other workers who have ordered in sufficient time must have their shipments set aside in order to make way. for those “rush orders”. We suggest that, in the future, in order to receive special attention, you fill out your order blank properly and if it is really urgent mark it “Rush —needed by Sept. 2”, or &quot;Hush— wanted by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> Testimony rerlod”. With tills information we shall he able to determine how necessary it is to place your order ahead of others who have planned in advance to have their shipments received in time to be handled without any extra attention. Special orders always take more time and cut info efficient dispatch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If there is a real urgency for orders and the freight delivery is too slow, please mark your order “Ship by Parcel Post or Express”, and then the difference between the parcel post or express and the freight rate will be charged to you, as has been the custom. We desire to give the friends the very best service in the shipping department, always giving the pioneers preference, because their livelihood depends upon the work they are doing. The office, therefore, will greatly appreciate your marking your order blank I properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Do the Pioneers Have Enough Territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The forces in the field will soon be augmented by the members of the Bethel family, as during the period from August 22 to September 5 the factory and home will be closed. Of course, during this vacation period, pioneers and others in isolated territory will not be able to receive territory assignments from the office, so arrangements must necessarily be made before vacation to insure sufficient territory for the pioneers’ activities. Will each pioneer now kindly survey the territory situation in the field where he is witnessing and, if he does not have sufficient for full-time work until after September 5, take the matter up with the pioneer department at once, so there will not be a last-minute rush. Every territory assignment is to be thoroughly covered. Do not depend on getting territory immediately after vacation, as mail may be quite heavy at that time. Have your territory assignment and a good stock of literature on hand before vacation, in order fhat you may have a large share in advancing the interests of Jehovah’s kingdom to the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibles and Concordances</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In some instances Bibles and concordances have been ordered by pioneers and auxiliaries requesting that these be charged to their accounts. Tills is to inform the brethren that orders for Bibles (other than No. 116, the dollar Bible) and concordances can be filled only when accompanied by remittance to pay for them, because it is necessary for the Society to procure these from publishing houses and pay cash for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Also, It is not possible to ship Bibles and concordances on approval. Some of the friends have made it a practice to order Bibles and concordances mid then, if the party who had ordered them doesn’t take them, to return them for credit. Oftentimes when shipping them back the Bibles are not carefully packed and are damaged in shipment and it is impossible to send them out again as new books. It is suggested that brethren always obtain a deposit on orders for Bibles aud concordances which have to be ordered specially, and thus insure their being accepted when delivery is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Taking Hold of Every Opportunity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Two pioneer brethren using a trailer say that a great number of people come to look at their car when they drive into a town, and ask many questions about it. So they have contrived to turn the curiosity of the people into an opportunity for witnessing. In answer to the varied questions the people ask, they sriy something like this: &quot;Yes, in the work we are doing it suits our purposes very well indeed. Probably you have hea rd Judge Rutherford,” etc., and they go rigid on will, Ilie testimony, and in many instances place sets of the books then and there. Where the people are really interested in the Kingdom message they invito them to Inspect the interior of the cur. and then further tell them about the message and arouse their greater interest. Sornel lines people driving through slop, and so receive the testimony in both oral and printed form, who would ordinarily not be reached in the house-to-house witness, Probably other pioneers may put the sug; gestion to good use. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Mexican Brethren Unanimously Express Desire to Enter Full-Time Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A report has been received from the Society’s branch office in Mexico containing the results of the nine-day con ven l ion held there May 21-29. Because it was strictly a service convention, and because we arc certain you will rejoice to behold the zeal of tlie brethren there, we give you the following excerpts therefrom :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The convention was devoted to devising ways and means to further the service of Jehovah in Mexico and to stir up tlie witnesses of Jehovah to more and better service. From 8:30 a.m. to 12 noon each day was devoted to field service from door to door. The city of Mexico was attacked by this happy group of soldiers of Jehovah, with the following result:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark12"><span class="font1">Number of workers</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark13"><span class="font1">Number of testimonies</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark14"><span class="font1">Number of hours</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark15"><span class="font1">Number of books placed</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark16"><span class="font1">Number of booklets placed</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font1">Total literature placed</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark18"><span class="font1">Number of obtsiiners</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Tlie manager of the Society’s office in Mexico and tlie brother in r-harge of the pioneer and field service departments spent a few hours for ihe first two days going over the field in an automobile, supervising, inspecting, helping, teaching, etc. After that both of them went to work with the books from door to door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Tlio convention was attended by about 160 persons, of which about (10 are real witnesses of Jehovah. The other’s were new friends, a few 'old men’ and ‘old women’, and four or five of our former bitter enemies, who kept themselves quiet and in order, and wondering,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Several resolutions were passed by unanimous vote, us follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Resolved that from now ou, in Mexico, it will be the recognized standard of duty of every consecrated servant of Jehovah to devote all his or her time to the service of God’s kingdom. In other words, every one of Jehovah’s witnesses should be a full-time worker. Resolved, that from now on, in Mexico, companies are regarded aud considered as temporary abodes or ‘nests’ for newcomers, all of whom will receive all attention and care ; but will be, from the beginning, educated to understand that they are being nourished for the only purpose, of getting them ready to devote their entire time to the service of Jehovah’s kingdom, as soon as possible. Full-grown birds who like to sleep in the nests (companies) all of their lives will find them uneouifortablc, as not much time and attention will be wasted on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;As a result of this convention, 20 company workers, who were at-lending the same, applied for the pioneer work.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">May the Lord bless our brethren in Mexico in thoir efforts to carry out their good resolutions to the honor and praise of his name.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Storage of Books</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The friends throughout tlie country have responded very well to the request made as to the amount of clean and dry storage space available. If you do not receive the full supply of cartons you stated you could store, don’t let that worry you. The Society is keeping the record in its files, for use in case it becomes necessary to make further shipments at some time in the future. We appreciate the information.</span></p>

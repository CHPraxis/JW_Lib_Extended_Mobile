<p><span class="font4">When the figures for Ilie fiscal year, just closed, are prepared, we are certain, they will bring much joy to the hearts of the anointed. Now, however, is the time to look ahead and start planning as to how the coming year cun be made a greater year than ever before in showing forth the Lord’s praises. Think of ways and means for getting in more hours in the Lord's service; of how you can cover your territory with the least amount of time wasted hi getting to and from your territory, so that as many hours as possible can be spent in the actual witnessing. Many hours are lost by standing around and talking before getting to work, and in not knowing beforehand just where yon arc going and how to get there. Plan your work. Think ahead of lime on how you are g'oing to carry it out. When parties are arranged to go out in the rurals, plan what you will do in ease of rain or in case the roads are impassable. Be ready for all .such emergencies. Make your plans in advance, so that you ean act immediately when the emergency arises.</span></p>

Sing praises to. the..Lord, -which dwelleih in Zion: declare among the people his doings.”—Ps. 9:1,2,10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That is what the remnant will again be found doing November 1220 because that is the designated time for Praise Testimony Period. Throughout the entire earth this song of praise, showing forth all the marvelous works of Jehovah and declaring among the people his doings, will be lifted up by Jehovah's witnesses as they go to and fro with the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people of the United States in. particular, - during the past few mouths, have been listening to the praises of men who have been seeking public office. Many of these men, if the truth were known, are corrupt and unscrupulous politicians and yet they pose as the saviors of the people that they might gain political power, money and fume. Political parties have been pitted against each other. 'Men and women have slaved for days and long hours into the night that their candidate might win and that they might gain for themselves some advancement. They have lifted high their party standards and sought to rally the people to I heir support, promising .them relief from their woes if they’but support the party. But the Lord says, “Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can de-</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The special combination to be offered at this time is especially appropriate for Praise Testimony Period. It is to be a 81.00 combination made up of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> Books 1, 2 and 3 and six of the new booklets. Special effort is to be made to place these in the hands of the people at this time because the message contained in these latest publications is a message of praise to Jehovah’s name. As stated in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> 1, “The theme that runs throughout the entire book of Ezekiel is that of the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The phrase, ‘Know that I am the Lord [Jehovah],’ occurs more than sixty times in the prophecy.

Any six of the 13 new booklets may bo included in the combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As for territory, directors should plan to have territory ready in cities or towns as well as in rural sections so that if at the last minute the weather turns off bad, the rural work can be called oft and the workers put to work in the towns. If the weather is good, and the roads passable, then it would be well to send out some of the Workers into the rural sections to get in a few more “good licks” before the winter settles down and makes rural work more difficult.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Monthly Instead of Weekly Reports </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">To Be Made by Companies, Pioneers, and Auxiliaries</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>System Begins October 1</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Read Instructions Carefully</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">Beginning October 1, 1032, instead ot Bending in a weekly report of activities in the door-to-door witness work, the companies, pioneers and auxiliaries are asked to send in their reports once a month. This system has been followed for some time by the sharpshooters with such good success that it has been decided to put it into effect in the other brunches of the field service. This will mean a saving in postage and also in the expense of supplying report Cards to the workers. It will also mean less work for you and for the office. BET to make, the plan succeed, everyone must cooperate and when the end of the month comes the monthly report should the made out nt once and mailed to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are anxious to make this matter of keeping the reports as simple for you as possible. Therefore, we arc supplying the companies, sharpshooters, 'pioneers and auxiliaries, along with the new monthly report cards, special dally record sheets upon which to keep an account of the work which is dono each day they are out in the service. Pioneers and auxiliaries, particularly, should cultivate the habit of keeping these daily record sheets in their Watchtower binder, so they will always know just where to find them. At tlie end of your day’s work, before you forget it, make your entry on the sheet Of just what you have done. At the end of the month, then, all you will have to do is to add up each column on the sheet and copy the totals on your monthly report card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whenever a special service period comes aronnd, as will be the case in Kingdom Testimony Period, October 1-9, and also in Praise Testl-</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>A Letter</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Dbab Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Greetings in the Most High, Jehovah God. Having just recently read with great interest your latest </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">HuHetin-</span><span class="font4"> and stating reports and comparing this year’s results with those of 1931, we note that there was a great drop in placement of bound books for the month of May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Now then, in your comments on same you state that this is to a great extent due to the scare of the hard Limes, etc., and that the friends no doubt carry that impression in their own minds as a result of hearing everyone else talking these strenuous times, and as a result the friends do not demonstrate the bound books properly, or drop to the booklets as soon as they have that same excuse put up to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Now we find that the people here In our territory use that ‘hard times’ excuse just the same as auy-where else, but we find that a great deal of this can be overcome by the Lord’s grace and by each worker's trying to use his wits to the best ot‘ advantage by telling the people that what they need to know, above all else, is the truth in regard to the conditions in the world, and impress ■ upon their minds that iti these perilous times we will have to learn what the Lord wauts us to know in order that they might have his protection and care during the great conflict that is just ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Here in our company wc find that we have placed more bound books during the past months of the fiscal year than we ever placed before. mony Period, November 12-20, one of the regular cards should be used, marking it at the top, “Testimony</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Period — (date)&quot;, in place of the month. This report will be considered as a special report, but the work done during such periods should be included In your monthly report together with all the other weeks of the month. In other words, your monthly report is to show the entire work done during the month, regardless of whether or not there has been a service period in it. In ease a service period should be partly in one month and partly in another, that would make no difference in making out your monthly report, since the monthly report calls for a report of the actual work done between the first and last days of the month. The special service period report, however, would take in all the work accomplished from the beginning to the end of the special service period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Company' workers can cooperate with their directors in this matter of reporting, by forming the habit of making out a regular workers’ slip each day<sup>7</sup> they go out. in the work and turning it in promptly to their director, so that he can make his entries of work done daily. If company workers go out together in a party, each should make out a report while i.Iie matter is fresh in mind and give it to the car driver, so that he can turn the reports over to the service committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since this uew system begins Saturday, October 1, we request everyone who submits a report direct to the Society to send their last weekly report for the week as ending Friday, September 30. The next report card should be marked “Testimony Period October 1-9”; and the one following that, for the entire month of October, including the work done during the Kingdom Tes-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why? Just because we have ’pushed’ them more than ever. More placements of sets of ten than ever before, in spite of the old ‘hard times cry’. We try to grasp every opportunity to place books with sales peo-, pie or others that call at our door. <sup>!</sup> Every household buys cats, clothing ' and a thousand articles that are needed around the home or place of business, find we are daily giving money to other people for our temporal needs. Why not take advantage of these opportunities, as we all know that these same people need the truth even more than they need the money we give them for goods we obtain from said sales' people ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Within less than a week’s time-I was able to place more than 20’ bound books, besides several booklets, and this was accomplished without leaving the house. For an example: We knew that we had to have a few<sup>7</sup> household brushes, bnt kept on using our old ones. The Lord sent a man tbat had been a carpenter hnt out of work to our house. The story he had was that he was compelled to sell brushes in order to get a few dimes to keep his family alive. I asked the man in and asked him how his business was and he said, ‘Bad.’ So I stalled to tell him about what was coming and I showed him the ten bound books. So lie said that he could not buy them. I told him tbat we needed some of his brushes but we were hard up too. I hinted that I would take some of his goods in trade. He was well pleased and more than willing Io get the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">timony Period even though reported onco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The old stock of WEEKLY report cards should be destroyed and only the new Monthly cards sent in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ONCE </span><span class="font4">A </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">MONTH.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Suggestions for Trading</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the pioneers have informed us that they have actually lost money by taking produce in exchange for the books. This is usually because they have allowed the retail valuation on the articles received in exchange, and then when the time came to dispose of these articles they have not been able to get more than the wholesale valuation of the articles. It should be remembered that if a storekeeper Is to take something off your hands, he himself wishes to make a profit on the goods. Unless you know where you can dispose of your goods at the full retail valuation, it would be well for you to acquaint yourself with the wholesale valuations, so that, you can dispose of your produce. Pioneers could hardly expect the company workers to take over their produce at retail prices higher than those prevailing in their local market, merely because the pioneer has allowed too high a valuation on the produce received in exchange from the party with whom the literature was left. A little foresight on the part of the pioneer, and a preliminary survey of his territory, will aid materially in being able to know just what, articles to take, how much to allow for them, and how to dispose of that which is received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another helpful suggestion has been offered by a party of pioneers. They have been arranging with the owner of a gas station in their territory to buy all their gasoline from him provided he fixes all their flat tires free of charge while they are in that-territory. They have found that in most places the owners are glad to do this for i.lieir business, or at least to agree to fix a certain number free. This eaves the pioneers time, money and strength for the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Another instance: Sister needed to have some work done at a jeweler’s, so we got into a discussion with the jeweler, He said that he had gone into bankruptcy and wanted to know what was coming. We showed him the set of ten hound books. This Mme man told us that he had been an agnostic for thirty years because he could not swallow what the churches taught. He said that he had heard Judge Rutherford several times and recognized the truth when he heard it. So he trad-cd the work we wanted done for a set of ten bound books and a subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Now these are just a few ways we try to place the books. Now if you wish to use any of our points in bringing these things before the friends in your </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font4"> you are welcome to use them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Yours for increased opportunities in the service of the Lord,&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Signed)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Service Leaders for Praise Period</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">As usual, the Bethel family will be in the field service both Saturdays and Sundays of Praise Testimony Period and the usual provision for supplying brethren to lead the different companies in the field service</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Symbol for New Booklets</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">In order to simplify the making out of invoices for the new booklets, the symbol “bk-6” will be used on the Invoices to denote combinations of the first six of the new booklets, I.e., lITto </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">is God? What is Truth? Causa</span><span class="font4"> of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Death, Hereafter, Good </span><span class="font4">-Votes, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty.</span><span class="font4"> The symbol “bk-13” will be used to denote combinations of the entire J3 of the booklets, i.e., the first six, just mentioned, together with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Final War, What You Need, Health and Life, Home and Happiness, Keys of Heaven, Where are the Dead?</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, The Hope of the</span><span class="font4"> World. Whenever these booklets are ordered in any other combinations than these two, the booklets will be listed individually according to their respective symbol.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>When to Order Radio Slips</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the pioneers, auxiliaries and companies, in placing their orders for hooks, have overlooked the ordering of their radio slips and then followed their book order a few days later with another order for the slips. This means additional work all around, as well as the added expense of making a parcel post shipment, whereas the slips might just us well have been included in the freight shipment of books. If the Kingdom Interests are closely watched, many time atsd money savers of this nature can be effected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the pioneers have failed to notice that these slips are supplied them free of charge for working isolated territory. Where pioneers are working in company terrilory, they should get their slips from the local company the same as the other workers do, but when they arc working in isolated territory the Society is willing to bear the expense of the slips by providing them free of charge for such sections in order that the people might be informed of the radio transcription programs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">As was stated in the November (1931) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font4"> it is no longer necessary for service directors and sharpshooters to keep a yearly territory report for the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the place of a yearly territory report to the Society, service directors are to notify the Service Department In those eases where the companies are not thoroughly covering the territory, assigned to them, in order that either an appropriate adjustment of territory may lie made or that provision may lie made to send in pioneers, to see that a thorough witness is given caeh -year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sharpshooters, however, do not need to notify the Society in those cases where their territory' is not being thoroughly covered, for the Society makes it a point to send In pioneers to assist the sharpshooters whenever this is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, this does not apply to pioneers, as they ure to continue to submit to the Society the territory reports requested of them, the same as ever, i.e., upon completion of the assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">within an area ot 300 or 400 miles from Bethel will also apply. Please make your applications for these brethren as early as possible, in order that appointments may be made in suflieient time to allow the brethren to correspond with the different companies that they are going to serve. In many' cases we find that at the last moment companies write In here for brethren to serve them and after they receive the appointment there isn’t an opportunity to make proper advance preparation for the field service.</span></p>

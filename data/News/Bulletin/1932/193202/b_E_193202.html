<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Make Special Efforts in “Testimony Periods”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">U'haf Will You- lie Duiny J)iirl&gt;ig Intemational Thanksgiving</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony Period ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah's witnesses have but one ambition in life, and that is to honor the name of their great. God. They want to see his name vindicated, and they know that now they have a part in that most wonderful work. At times some of the infirm and elderly brethren cannot get out into the witness work, but they do make “special efforts” to slug praises to their God. Generally during Testimony Periods there are more workers iii the field than at any other time. This is due to the fuel, that all of the brethren put forth a special effort to put in time witnessing for the Kingdom. We wonder how ninny workers will be in the field during International Thanksgiving Testimony Period? You know Hint on the first day of this period, March 20, the Lord’s anointed will be celebrating the Memorial feast. All of Jehovah’s witnesses will make a special effort to associate themselves with a group of the Lord’s people so that they may partake of the Lord’s Supper that evening. This will be impossible for some, but they will observe the Memorial, just the same as the companies. Everyone who partakes of the Memorial feast should that day- make a special effort to engage in the Lord’s service. In that way, all will,, we feel sure, appreciate that evening's feast as they never did before in their lives. Would it not lie delightful if the report for service workers throughout ■ the United States were the same as the Memorial report? Would it not afford you much joy to know tlisit the total number of workers during International Thanksgiving Testimony Period throughout the entire earth was tiie same as that of the Memorial participants? Really that is what it should be. All those who partake of the Memorial know Jehovah, ttnd the only ones who know him will seek to honor him and obey liis commands. ‘They tire willing in the day of his power.’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Eight days tire set aside for In-ierimtior.al Thanksgiving Testimony I Triad: and what a blessed period i bar will be for the Lord’s mminted I At this season of the year all of the Lord's remnant in tin? earth will make a special effort to go forth as a united company singing his jniiises (wen </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ik</span><span class="font1"> they are the same evening j pai-tiiking of the Lord's supper as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">j </span><span class="font1">a united company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This period, of all lestinmny periods, should be mi outstanding one, because of climatic conditions. It is</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">spring in the northern hemisphere and full in the southern, giving equal opportunity for the workers all over the earth to engage in field activity. We feel sure that especially nt this time every one will put forth a special effort to engage In tiie witness work, mid then continue throughout the year to make arrangements and special efforts to engage in the work until this gospel of the Kingdom is preached in all I the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;।</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Often in foreign-speaking districts, such as Polish, for example, there may be found some English-spenking people, and it would be well, for all of the foreign-speaking brethren to carry the English </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> booklet with them so that they can offer it to these people who cannot read Polish, or to peoi.de of any other language among whom they may be working.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A World-wide Witness for 8 Days Can 2.000.000 Testimonies Be Given?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The United Ranks of the -Lord’s Army Will,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We Believe</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Unity is the keynote of liurniony, cooperation and effectiveness. It is the very opposite of discord, strife and waste. Since the Cedar Point convention in September 1922, the visible army of the Lord has been marching on towards greater harmony, cooperation and effectiveness. The local organizations have been perfected mid strengthened ; the regional service activity and service conventions, local and national, have done much to build up the national organizations of the Lord’s people throughout the earth, and with the International Convention Period of July .193.1, an international unity wits established, so that throughout the earth the I,ord's people are now going forward as a unit. The Ue«r| </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hook</span><span class="font1"> for 1932 brings clearly to our, attention the unity of Jehovah’s witnesses. It matters not whether; they are in the frigid zones of the| north or the torrid zones of the south ; they are unitedly proclaiming the same message at the same time. Centuries ago the prophet of the Lord was given a vision of what is actually taking place among the Lord’s anointed now, and in ecstasy he cried out, “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him I” If a mere vision of these events thrilled tin? prophet of God to that degree, how much more should we, who are now privileged to participate in the actual thing, lie thriller!!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How appropriate that this International Thanksgiving Testimony Period should commence with the Memorial date this year. The Memorial symbols depict our Lord being broken for us and our privilege of being broken with him and drinking of the cup which he hands us. This cup, as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watehtoicer</span><span class="font1"> 1ms clearly established from tiie Scriptures, represents the course of action which the Lord outlines for his people, that is. Io be his witnesses, and the joy that the anointed have in bearing testimony to liis name. What keener joy or .satisfaction of soul can be imagined than that of assembling to partake of the emblems with the consciousness of having spent tiie day in drinking the actual cup which the Txird has ponied and each one determining that, by the I,ord's grace, he will continue to drink with the Lord’s anointed throughout the earth during the remainder of this Thanksgiving Testimony Period, and tliroitghoul eternity, for that matter. Just imagine, imagine, the Lord’s army scattered in nil lands, thousands of them, holding forth tiie banner of truth I Will these thousands of witnesses give testimony to 2,000,001) people? We believe the Lord's army can and will, in these eight days. Undoubtedly this would make the participation in the Memorial tliis year an event of greatest solemnity and joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The preparations for this period will, of necessity, vary according to the climatic conditions tit that season of the year. In the far north the frost will still lie in rhe ground, enabling Uie friends to get around fairly well, so that they can reach the majority of the lawns in their territory assignmcnl. hi Ilie south it will be quite warm. The friends there can work in any portion of their territory. The same is true of the west coast. In sections where the thaw lias set in and country roads-are in poor condition and impassable, the friends will, of course, ie? limited to the larger towns in their assignment. Local service committees are acquainted with local conditions; consequently they should commence now to make their plans, taking into consideration their own particular conditions and the kind of weather they would naturally expect nt that season of the year, and make their plans accordingly. Everyone who partakes of the emblems at Memorial season, of course, wants to take part in the actuality also; otherwise partaking of the emblems means nothing. Therefore, unless physically incapacitated so as to be unable to get around, everyone who intends to parlake of the Memorial should be found us one of God's witnesses carrying the Kingdom message to the people during this period. We are living in the last days, there can he no doubt, and Jehovah’s witnesses will press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ideal combination to be offered during this period is the bound-book combination. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> booklet has been widely distributed, and in the minds of those who have rend it it will undoubtedly have created a great desire for further knowledge of the Lord’s purposes and the outcome of the crisis that is now facing the world. Therefore the opening presentation should be the bound books. Where the territory justifies it. the ten books for $2.50 is the ideal offer and should be emphasized. However, in territory where the depression has affected the people, the four bound books for $1,00 should be stressed; and where four books cannot: be placed, [hen one for 3Oe may be offered to the people, or four booklets for 25e. Try to leave sit least tho </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> booklet in every home, if they haven’t it already.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In reviewing the results of the first three months’ work by Jehovah's witnesses during this fiscal year, and comparing them with those of the same period last year, a wonderful increase is noted both in activity and work accomplished. First, there were more brethren engaging in the door-to-door service, they put in more time in the field, they placed more literature and in almost triple the number of persons’ hands, and gave 1,957,356 more testimonies than in the first three months of the previous fiscal year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The number of pioneers in the service increased by 440, of auxiliaries hy 48, and of company workers and sharpshooters by 055 during these three months over the numbers of a year ago. Likewise, each one of these groups of workers put in a larger amount of time in the work, showing a total of 1)55,650 hours in the three months. This is 235,051 hours more than were spent in the field during the same months of the fiscal year 19,11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">As an aid to pioneers and auxiliaries in disposing of chickens and other foodstulfH, it is suggested that institutions such as hospitals, homes of various kinds, including old soldiers’ homes, old people’s homes, convalescent homes, nil use large quantities of food, and probably these could be sold to them. While carrying on the witness work, the location of these places can be noted and then called upon when a supply of produce has been accumulated. Pioneers who are following this practice suggest it for the benefit of an increase of 1,152,375 over the number of obtainer.s of literature during October, November and December of the year 1930. Testimonies delivered totaled 4,584,39(1, which Is 1,957,350 more than the total tor the same time in the fiscal year preceding.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The total placement for the three mouths of this fiscal year was 403,823 books and 1,804,350 booklets, or a grand total of 2,208,173 pieces of literature. This shows a total increase of 579,444 over the output in the same three months of last year, although it is to be seen that 108,-9G1 fewer clothbound books were placed this year than last. This is to be accounted for by the fact that there was an increase of 688,405 booklets placed in the hands of the people, and which were practical ly ah </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> booklets. However, the Bound Book Testimony Period will provide n good opportunity for the brethren to make up (his drop in clothbound books.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The radio folders will all contain a list of every station that broadcasts Broliter Rutherford’s lectures, in alphabetical order by states, and, in addition, those folders for use in zone one will have a red border around the list of stations for each state in that zone. The lists of stations in zones two, three and four will also be so indicated. Zone five will use the folder without borders around its state lists, since there arc too many states in its area to lie so marked.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>You’ll Enjoy This!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">“Dear Brethren,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“We received your kind teller dated December .16 and are pleased that we arc going farther south this weather. We are leaving with the people :i wonderful witness wherever we go, because it is our Fu-tlier’s due time for Ibis to be done. Al! the credit is due io Dim. We have had the privilege of serving Jehovah in France for about a year, arid the varied experiences we have had in that I line have gladdened our hearts. We have been arrested a few times, and were glad of it, because wc were able to witness to the local rulers, and invariably more books were placed after these free advert isements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;We continue to use the Testimony card which was scut to us at the commencement of our work out here, because those who road it are able Io concentrate their thoughts on the message contained thereon, We have been very successful in placing the books during the past year, and we attribute part of our success to the fact that wc keep lire books out of sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“A few years ago a Special Bulletin, ‘Suggestions for Workers,’ । was issued in which was shown how | lo make a ‘canvassing jacket'. We ' wear one of those under our coats, the pockets of which hold 5 books and 20 bookiefs. We can knock at Ilie doors of houses, enter shops and bureuus, and march along the garden paths, without anyone's knowing our business until they have read the curd. We leave our eases at the side of the doors, so that they cannot be seen. While the person is reading the card, we gently draw out of the pocket the set of books and booklets we have previously put handy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;There are three English pioneers wprking in Belgium using this method who arc having great, success. We have got Into the habit of smiling sweetly at those who scowl or bark at us, because, after we have left them, they may think that they wished they had been nicer with us, mid endeavor to get the books indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;When starting new territory we procure a map of the department, and also maps of the towns we work in that department. Then we go to work systematically, and each evening mark in red pencil the streets we have done. This avoids confusion and enables us to make a thorough witness, which is necessary, because we often find in the most unlikely places those who are ready for the Truth. We have placed many foreign pieces of literature by approaching men working on new buildings. They are generally a mixed company and are glad to meet someone who can bring them something to read in their own language. Every town of over 2,(100 inhabitants within reach of our center is visited by cycle or train, and a quick witness given in the main centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The Lord lias richly blessed these efforts. We realize Iha l all our efforts would be useless without divine aid, and therefore we humbly ask the Father each morning that He will use us to Uis honor and glory. Another cause of our success is, we endeavor to quickly obey the instructions coming from the &quot;powers iimt be”, realizing that we are being guided in | his manner by the Lord. A quota card is a great help. We set ourselves a quota for the year 1931, and by the Lord’s grace wc exceeded it by a good number. Faith will bring its own^ward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Muy God bless you as you continue to be I-Iis witnesses.</span></p>

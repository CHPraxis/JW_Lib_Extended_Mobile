<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thohk who know Jkhovah will be anxious to seo that before the road conditions get bad tlic most thorough witness possible is given in the territory that Is inaccessible (luring the winter months. Now is the time to reach l.lie farmers and the rural merchants. Winter is gradually approaching. [from the standpoint of world conditions this promises to be the worst winter the people of this country have ever experienced. Every thinking person knows this to be true, despite the ballyhoo of the politic:! I wind-jammers to the contrary. In general, the farmers and people in rural districts give inure serious thought to these conditions than, possibly, any other class of people in the country. Therefore this is the Lime l.o place the good news of God’s kingdom in their hands. If they cannot or will not in lie a hook combi mil ion or a book, try to leave some of the booklets, by all means. The country people, as a rule, have all kinds of usable foodstuff which they will be glad to exchange for the literature if they have no money to contribute. Many of the brethren have the impression that i.he exchanging of the Kingdom message for produce, wearing apparel or fowl should be carried on extensively' only by pioneers who । specialize in that type of work. This is wholly a wrong view. None of the company witnesses, sharpshooters, auxiliaries or pioneers should I ever let an opportunity pass without endeavoring to place the King- ! limn message In the hands of the people. If they are financially unable to contribute anything in the way of money, then the exchange method should he adopted and cn-1 couraged by everybody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Those who kjow Jehovah real-1 </span><span class="font3">ize that the big thing today is lo place the knowledge of the kingdom of God in Ilie hands of the people by one means or anolher. Therefore plan carefully for the next i.wo months; arrange to cover all </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">scattered territory, and try to provide something profitable for those people to feed their minds upon during the winter months.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>STORAGE STOCK</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">To supply their needs the companies should draw from the storage stock which has been shipped to them. However, care should be taken in handling this stock. See to it that it is not left open so that dust can get in and settle in the books. Carefully cover each carton after you have taken out the number of books you need. When ordering booklets try to place order for 100-pound shipments. If it is necessary to order a few books to make up the weight, do so.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Calling Card for Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sonic of Jehovah’s witnesses have been using a calling curd to introduce themselves to those upon whom they call, not only in business districts, but also in residential sections. Such cards arc especially useful when a maid answers the door bell, since the card can be given to her to present to the man or lady of the house. Those who use the cards believe that they add a certain dignity to their presentation of the Kingdom message and serve as a means of identifying them, not personally, hut as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Seeing the card brings forcefully to the attention of the individual called upon the nature of your call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the request for these cards has been made, the Society has arranged to print, al the rate of 50c st thousand to companies, sharpshooters, pioneers, and auxiliaries, a standard calling card size 3-1/8 x 1-5/8 bearing the following wording :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of JEHOVAH’S witnesses Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Kingdom of Jehovah our God</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These cards will be used in the sections where trouble has occurred and in special campaigns which arc arranged for covering such sections, but they may be put to regular use by the witnesses in all sections if so desired.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In oil large cities, hundreds of people live in rooming houses, apartment houses which are difficult to work on account of doormen prohibiting admission, and hotels. These people seldom, if ever, come in con-tae; with the Kingdom message unless it is at their place of business. Many of them do not have even so much as a radio by which to become acquainted with the truth. How i.o reach these people is a problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">'Phis being election year, it is possible to obtain the list of registered voters. In New York city, for example, such lists arc published by a ssembly districts, showing the names of every voter living in each city block of the district. Where</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Every Worker Should Sing Praises</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">Now is the time of war, and Jehovah is assembling his host under Christ tor the last light. It Is time to be awake and on the alert. To the remnant a part in this great war has been assigned, and that part is to proclaim the praises of Jehovah God while the armies march to battle. This, of course, is a general condition and should apply at all times, but during the period between November 12 and 20 a special effort will lie made by all of the anointed throughout the earth to sing the praises of Jehovah, our God. No one can be of the remnant now who fails or refuses to embrace the opportunity of singing forth his praises. The period of praise is here, and no greater honor can he conferred upon any living creature than that of telling the people of the glorious honor of His Majesty Jehovah; of his wondrous works; of the terrible acts he will perform against the enemy. Jehovah has provided the radio, the printing presses and book machines, which have supplied his witnesses with millions of copies of the Kingdom message in more than fifty languages, and he has shortened the trouble on the earth and is holding back the four winds that this Kingdom gospel, tills message of praise, might ascend to the glory of his name and the blessing of his creatures. Aside from the. Society, with the means which God has placed in its possession, there is no organization on earth equipped to do and doing this work in Jehovah’s name and to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">more than one voter lives at the same address, they are all grouped together under that particular street, number. In this way many places that appear to be private homes, at which only one person may have been witnessed to up to the present time, are found in reality l.o be rooming houses with many occupants. If the witness has this Information concerning his territory, when he calls at such a place he can ask by name for the various parties living there and give the testimony to each, instead of only to the landlady as heretofore- In New York- city these lists may be had at the rate of 25e for each assembly district, at the city hall. The public library' also has a set, from which the names can he copied if such is desired. The same is probably true in other cities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The dear, ringing command of the Lord to his “servant” today is, ■■Lift up a standard for the people.” This standard must be lifted up by telling the people the truth of and concerning Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The message of the hour is contained in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> One, Two and Three. The pointed judgments of Jehovah against ecclcsia.sticism and the various other divisions and subdivisions of the Devil’s organization, as foretold by the Prophet. Ezekiel, are clearly outlined there; and, also, tffe unsearchable goodness of Jehovah is shown in the wonderful temple, the division of the land, and the river of life. Who of the anointed, after having themselves partaken of those wonderful bounties at the hands of Jehovah, could withhold the praise due his holy name<sup>-</sup>? And in addition to this we have thirteen booklets containing the most terse, forceful and pointed presentation of the Kingdom truth ever heard on earth since the days of Jesus. The three </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> and any six of these booklets upon a contribution of 81.00. Surely the Lord has abundantly supplied us with the instrument of praise. Let every witness, pioneer, auxiliary, company witness and sharpshooter, be found in the front line of this glorious army during Praise Testimony Period, and every other available moment also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Remember, all pioneers, auxiliaries, company witnesses and sharpshooters arc to send in a special report covering the period from November 12 to 20 inclusive, and also to include this period in their monthly report. For this special report use one of the regular report cards sent you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These names might be put to good use in getting to call upon people living in hotels and fashionable apartment houses. By calling to see a particular person, giving the person's name, it might be possible to make several such calls without interruption. Another visit to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">same, apartment house or hotel could be made a little later on, and several more calls be made at that time. By making several trips at various intervals, keeping track of l.he names of those called upon, the building might be thoroughly covered. While this -would take considerable time, if there happen to be several such apartments or hotels in tlie section it would not be necessary to lose much time. One could make two or three calls </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in one </span><span class="font3">building, thou go on to the next</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER POINTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the. event that the director should be unable, neglect, fail or refuse to carry out the instructions of the Society, the company should bring the matter to the attention of the Society as soon as possible. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font3">is hoped that this action will not be necessary, but the witness work in any company should not be bain-pered by inattention of the director.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Every member of the company engaging in the service an average of 3 hours a week, anil so reporting to the local service director, shall be entitled to receive books at the rate ut which the Society bills the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In determining who shall receive this rate, the matter shall be left between the worker and the Lord. If the worker comes to the service department mid requests books at the company rate it is to be accepted that that, one is putting in the 3 hours a week necessary to obtain books at that rate. If anyone misrepresents the facts for the purpose of getting the books at company i rates without complying with the j time requirements, he is answerable to the Lord, and not to anyone else.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The director is appointed by the Society and serves as its representative. He is also the representative of the company, inasmuch as he is chosen hy the Society upon the recommendation of the company. He is therefore a servant of both the company and the Society. His responsibility to the Society is that of carrying out the instructions he receives from the office from time to time through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, bulletins,</span><span class="font3"> letters, etc.; and his responsibility to the company is that of directing its field service, activities </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font3">territory assigned to it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">STOCKKEEPER</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The stockkeeper will have charge of all the supplies of literature furnished by the Society for the witness . work. It is the duty of the stock-1 keeper to keep full and accurate | account of the stock committed to his care. All supplies for the witness work will be obtained from the stockkeeper. The best course to follow is for the workers to contribute immediately for all hooks obtained from the stockkeeper. Credit may be extended to such workers as cannot immediately contribute for the books, with the understanding that It is the duty of the service treasurer to collect for them as they are placed, and, in case the worker becomes inactive, to notify the stockkeeper, who will request the return of the books that have not been placed. The stockkeeper should turn over to<sup>1</sup> the service treasurer all the contributions received for books.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">A failure to remit at least once within three mouths automatically places the company on the suspended credit list. No credit, will be allowed such a company until proper remittance is made. Each company should therefore endeavor to follow I rhe rule of remitting once a month for ilie literature placed; small companies, ut the very least once in three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each month a statement of the company account Is forwarded to the company in care of the director. It is the special duty of the service committee to examine this statement of the condition of the company account. Further, the service committee shall give to the company an account of the amount that has been remitted to the Society dining the month, the cost value of the books still in stock, and the amount of money on hand.</span></p>

Such work would he particularly good for cold, wintry days, or when'the weather is otherwise bad. It would also be good evening work for brethren who <sup>; </sup>do not have the opportunity to get out during the daytime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Large rooming houses arealso good territory for evening work, because of the likelihood of finding more of the roomers at home than during the daytime. These lists of names being np to date now, they can be put to good use right away; where-</span></p>

This necessitates that ft staff be kept, out of the field service merely to supply others with books; whereas if everyone came to the assembly prepared । for action, with his weapons of war with him, all could be right on the battle front singing forth the praises of Jehovah. For small assemblies there is no reason why all should not be able to bring their own supply of literature with them, for the amount of time to he spent in the work does not necessitiite their carrying a large supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is particularly true concerning pioneers and auxiliaries, who are granted special rates on the books, 'i’o some of the assemblies these witnesses have come without their books and have asked the local i organization to supply them with the literature at (heir special rates. This, of course, cannot be done. The local company organization is charged company rales on their literature; they have no </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">record of </span><span class="font3">persons to whom the special rates are grunted, and they know nothing of the standing of the individual with the Society as to whether or not a transfer of books from the company's account to the auxiliary’s or pioneer’s account on the Society’s hooks would be approved by the Society. Therefore pioneers and auxiliaries who attend these local assemblies should not expect to receive books at other ihati company rates. If they desire to take advantage of the special rates to which they are entitled they should carry their own books with them.</span></p>

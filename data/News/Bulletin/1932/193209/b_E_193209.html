<p><span class="font4">THOSE </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">WHO KNOW JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy His Favors</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord dias Prospered Zion</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah has been good to his people and has prospered them in the land. The Lord’s anointed today are putting forth a greater effort than ever before to the honor of his name. The Lord foretold this by his prophet Ezekiel, in the 36th chapter, For your consideration, we quote frotn a few pages of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> Two which relate to the progress of the kingdom work;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Since the World War God has caused his King at his temple to revive his work and his people relating to the interests of his kingdom. Companies of the faithful have been formed and organized for active service and have been and are serving the kingdom interests. New ‘plantations’ in the nature of offices, factories and organizations in many parts of-the earth have been formed and established to carry forward (and are carrying forward) the kingdom work. God’s people have pushed forward, and' each year ho has blessed their efforts by a wider publication of his name and of his kingdom. The work in behalf of ‘desolate places’, the ‘prisoner’ or ‘great multitude' class, is progressing and the name of Jehovah is being made known to the ‘prisoner’ class.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The number of pioneer witnesses has been far greater during the years that followed 1924 than ever before. The public speakers have been succeeded by regional service directors, and these, together with: local service directors, have strength-’ cncd the organization and have carried forward the house-to-house work of bearing testimony. This work has progressed as never before. Ta aid God’s people in doing this work, and to relieve them of many physical Durdens, the Lord has provided for the use of his people &quot;&nbsp;the radio, the best equipped book factories, machines, and printing presses, trucks and automobiles, service or house cars, supply depots, and a far greater efficiency in the organization for carrying on the kingdom work. His organization work, therefore, is fruitful, bringing forth fruit of the kingdom, to the glory of God. Beyond all question of doubt the kingdom is here and the Lord’s people on earlh have entered into the heritage thereof and the kingdom is more productive than at the beginning of the work of the church on earth. This is iu harmony with the words of Jesus: ‘Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall be do; because I go unto my Father.’ (John 14:12) God’s remnant people now restored to their ‘former estate’ arc now accomplishing more in the interests of the kingdom than heretofore.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With all these blessings and facilities provided by the Lord, the anointed do not slack their hands, but they push on with the work. They do not sit back and rest on their past aceomplisjudents, but they do just as the truly'anointed, Jehovah's witnesses, are doing today. The Lord’s people are working harder, putting in more time, giving more testimonies and expending greater energy in the interests of God’s kingdom. In the month of June, the pioneers averaged 26.16 hours per week. This is an hour more than the ’minimum time required. Even this high average of 26.16 hours was accomplished when tire pioneer list was about at its highest. The auxiliaries averaged almost their minimum time during this same month, with 11.97 hours. If each auxiliary had worked just two minutes more, 1hey would have averaged just' 12 hours a week. However, this time was better than they have averaged for a good many months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">, The company workers are pressing the battle to the gate, and the record for the month of June shows that they averaged 4.7 hours this year, i.o compare with 4.1 hours during the month of June last year. WHh this tine increase of average time, there were about 1200 more weekly workers in the field. Isn’t that splendid? The pioneer, auxiliary and company workers are putting forth even a greater effort now than they did a year ago. This shows that Jehovah’s witnesses are putting forth every effort to increase their kingdom interests every day to the glory of God's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the United States only, in just one month, June, Jehovah’s witnesses gave 1,213,321 testimonies. That shows their interest in the kingdom. The Lord surely is prospering his people.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font1">With this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> is being sent a quantity of wrappers for binding together in a very attractive manner the three books of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> and, also, helping to emphasize the special offer being made for only this three-day period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each witness should get his quota of wrappers from the local service director or sharpshooter as soon as possible, and then arrange to wrap his sets of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> BEFORE this period begins. The wrappers should be placed rather loosely around the books, to enable you to easily take them out for display and to put them back In the combination without breaking or tearing the wrapper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each director and sharpshooter is being sent 3 wrappers for each worker. Auxiliaries and pioneers are being sent 4 and 6 wrappers respectively, direct.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Everyone a Full-Time Worker for 3 Days</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The anointed can indeed testify that JEHOVAH lias opened the windows of heaven and poured forth a blessing ‘that there shall not be room enough to receive it’ (Mal. 3:10), in the gift of the wonderful message in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> books. They have been feasting upon it, and find that Jehovah has kept his promise, and is now telling his servant of his purposes &quot;before they spring forth”. (Isa. 42:9) Jehovah's servant realizes that this message is not given merely for their delectation, but that as the Lord directed the prophet Ezekiel, “Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.” (Ezek. 2:1) So now the servant must stand upon his feet, ready to actively go forth in Jehovah’s service In obedience to his instructions. Jehovah has given his servant the privilege of assimilating the message of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font1"> and now commands him to go and deliver it as directed. In Jehovah’s providence September 3, 4 and 5 is the time set for the INAUGURAL </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">VINDICATION</span><span class="font1"> TESTIMONY PERIOD, and during tliat time the three bonks </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> are to be a special offer to the people upon contribution of 75e. Ample time will have been had, and all of the faithful witnesses will be ready and waiting to go forth when the day arrives. The special wrappers for containing the sets of three books will have been received, and so each witness should have his sets all made up, his territory assignment designated, and be ‘standing on his feet’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the servant contemplates the manner in which Jehovah has increased 1.11 e privileges and opportunities of service which he has graciously granted since the coming of the Lord to His temple, they find much cause for thanksgiving unto Jehovah for his bounties. And now, just ten years since the general ‘pouring out of the holy spirit’, according to the prophecy of Joel, occurred, in 1922, when all In the earthly division of the organization of the Lord were com missioned to go forth with the message of truth (Joel 2:28,29), the commandment comes to the servant from Jehovah to go forth with this message of vindication. During these ten years the work of the servant has been greatly prospered find blessed by Jehovah. At different times during this period Jehovah has caused a special message to go forth and be emphasized. Since the great broadcast at Columbus last year by Brother Rutherford the “servant” as a whole has been serving warning upon “Christendom”, so called. Now the sword Ims been doubled the third time (Ezek. 21:14) and the strong message of the vindication of JEHOVAH’S great name must be proclaimed. Many now in the ranks of the Lord’s organization have been privileged to fight for the Kingdom since the beginning of the campaign, and some have joined the ranks during the past ten years. But as never before, Jehovah has revealed to them the importance and necessity that the message of vindication be proclaimed. To the servant it is not an onerous duty, but is rightfully prized as an esteemed privilege which they will joyfully seize upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">VINDICATION</span><span class="font1"> TESTIMONY PERIOD -will constitute a fresh assault upon the enemy organization, and so it might lie expected that it will Injure it, and cause Satan, Gog of Magog, and all their crowd to writhe in pain and anger. This will encourage the servant of Jehovah to fresh, renewed endeavors, and he will pay no attention nor give heed to any attempts at retaliation on the part of the enemy. Jehovah has commanded his servant forward in this new campaign of vindication and, by- His grace, protection, deliverance and strength, it will be vigorously carried ou to a successful conclusion, to the praise and glory of Jehovah’s name!</span></p>

<div>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Almost 600,000 More Hours Witnessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">8,1)64 Weekly Workers to Compare with 6,829 of 1931</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mighty indeed are the works of Jehovah in the eartli at this time. The individual efforts of his people often seem small and discouraging to them, but when the efforts of all are assembled and reduced to actual figures the results are seen to be marvelous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The activities of Jehovah's witnesses throughout the country during the first nine months of the year 1932 surpass anything that had ever been accomplished by the Lord's anointed in the same period of time in the past. At the beginning of the year a quota of 12 million testimonies was set. At the time it seemed very large, und it looked as though it was going to take the best efforts of each of the Lord’s anointed to attain to this goal by the end of the year. However, you will be agreeably surprised to note from these figures that at the end of nine months the total of testimonies has exceeded the quota for the year by almost 30,000, and it is 50 percent greater than that accomplished during the same period last year. But marvelous as this is, there is a still greater surprise in store for you when you compare the number of people obtaining literature this year with that of last. Last year we thought we hud reached the very apex </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font1"> this respect; but notice, this year’s figures reveal almost a 100-percent increase, or, in other words, during the first nine months, 3,530,739 homes obtained the Kingdom message in printed form, to compare with 1,856,437 last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The question naturally arises In each one’s mind, Row was this accomplished? We all appreciate the fact that it is the Ix&gt;rd’s doing, and not that of man, but it is well to look into the manner in which the Lord has accomplished these wonderful things, and thia summary reveals the fact that the Lord accomplished this by his spirit operating through his people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">You will notice that there was an average increase of over 1,200 workers a week this year, coirippred with last, wtiieh increased the total of hours by almost 600,000. Therefore it is the spirit of Jehovah, the zeal of His bouse consuming His anointed and stimulating them to push the battle to the gate to the glory of His name. The Prophet Ezekiel is pictured as being similarly stimulated and consumed in the Lord’s service as he appreciat ed the mighty organization of the Lord going into action and his blessed privilege of having some part therein. We read concerning him : &quot;I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me”; foreshadowing how the Lord puts his spirit upon his people and reveals to them a sufficient amount of the truth to enable them to discern God’s organization and the wicked organization of Satan in opposition io the Lord, and the great privilege they have of being In Jehovah’s organization and going into action against tho enemy and his agencies. When the Lord's people see the hideousness and wickedness of Satan’s organization, they go in the heat of the spirit and with bitterness against the enemy because the enemy Is God’s enemy. Theirs is not a malicious hatred, of course, but a sincere and earnest desire to see the enemy and his organization destroyed and God's name exalted, and the Lord blesses their zeal and devotion to him by crowning their efforts with greater success each year. Blessed indeed is the lot of the Lord’s anointed who see their privilege and take advantage of it at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The one point in the entire summary that did not exceed last year Is the number of bound books placed. We are over 230,000 below last year. However, this is more than offset by the fact that there was an increase of approximately one million booklets during the same period. The drop in bound books brings up a number of points that the anointed must consider at this time. First, the oppressive effects of the adversary in endeavoring to develop conditions in the earth whereby it is very difficult for the people to obtain the Kingdom message In its most effective presentation. Also, it is an indication that the adversary realizes the power of the Kingdom message, particularly in the book form; and this should be a stimulus to each one of the anointed to endeavor to place them in the hands of the people at any effort. We should always watch ourselves and see that we are not permitting the adversary to influence us to present the Kingdom message in a secondary manner because of the conditions that he has brought about on the earth. Emphasize the bound books at all times, and let the people determine what they are able to take. However, even In this the adversary has overreached himself; for, due to the f aet that the smaller combinations of books and booklets are presented, a greater number of people are obtaining some knowledge of the Kingdom than over before, and, undoubtedly, when we go around this territory again, the effect of the booklets will have made itself felt on the people and many of them will be waiting to obtain the bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Viewed from every angle Jehovah’s witnesses have much to rejoice over. No effort has been made in this die-cussion to classify the work done by the pioneers, auxiliaries, companies and sharpshooters. The table Itself presents tho activities of each one of These groups of Jehovah’s witnesses and each one can examine the tabic for himself and undoubtedly receive much comfort and stimulation from a study of it.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>All Can Witness</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>“I Have Put My Words in Your Mouth”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">From lime to time letters are received from brethren (throughout the south and middle west particularly) who state that the reason they arc not actively engaging in the Kingdom witness work from door to door is that they do not have presentable clothing to wear. They feel it Is therefore necessary to cease witnessing until such time as they are able to get together sufficient funds to purchase some good clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is only proper that each witness make himself as presentable as is reasonably possible in keeping with his means. Where the means and circumstances temporarily limit one's best clothes to those which are worn from day to day in the regular secular work, even in the eases where this consists of only overalls, it will invariably be found that such working clothes are fully presentable to witness among one’s neighbors and fellow workers, who are usually no better off, If as well off. When such brethren tidy themselves as well as possible, they will be joyfully surprised to see the success of their efforts. A clean face and hands, a heart-cheering message which lights up the countenance of the witness, will result in a very effective testimony, by the grace of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Scattered throughout the country are small companies, from two to five brethren, who live considerably apart from one another, anywhere from 15 to 30 miles. Many of these find it Impossible to thoroughly witness the territory assigned to them, because of lack of facilities for getting around their rural districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such companies should make their situation known to the Society, in order that pioneers may be encouraged to work such territory. In cases of this sort the pioneers can take these brethren in their cars from time to time and help the brethren to enjoy a larger share in the service. In turn, the brethren can assist the pioneers by purchasing as mueh as reasonably possible of the products which the pioneers have received in exchange for the books; also, assisting the pioneers in any other reasonable way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Will More Workers Be in the Field than During International Thanksgiving Testimony Period?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Days, weeks rind months go so fast that one wonders if there Is really any time between testimony periods. Yes, there is; and it is most interesting and encouraging to note how great an effort Jehovah’s witnesses put forth during these special periods. If you take the first nine months’ report, which includes several testimony periods, you will find that all the workers in the United States pul. in 2,753,043 hours, This number of hours was devoted to witnessing during the first 274 days of the Society’s fiscal year. Jehovah's witnesses averaged 10,047 hours per day in the field. But now compare this with the 200,000-Hour Testimony Period, a period of nine days of extraordinary effort. The Lord's anointed averaged 21,652 hours per day for the nine days, a total of 104,875 hours. This is twice as much work per day accomplished to the honor of Jehovah’s name and Word during a special period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now the Lord has arranged through his organization that on the first day of our fiscal year, October 1, 1932, a special effort shall be put forth to advertise the King and kingdom, and this will be Kingdom Testimony Period. October 1 to 9. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> announced this important period in the February 15th issue.

<p><span class="font1">The 200,000-Honr Testimony Period is now history. Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the United States put forth a noble effort to attain unto this wonderful goal, and almost made it. They came short 5,125 hours, which is so small that it can practically be said that they attained their goal. The table of the activity will show just how close the different groups came to attaining tlie quota set. The companies and sharpshooters put in an average of 9.7 hours, which is just three-tenths of an hour less than the quota of 10 hours far the week. The the organization of tins world. God’s typical people celebrated two periods of the year: one in the spring and one in Ilie autumn season. Those periods were 'holy unto tlie Lord’. (See Ezra 6: 19-22 : Nch. 8 : 1-3, 9-12, 14-18) Why should not God’s anointed people specially observe during the year two days of joy, thanksgiving and praise unto Jehovah God? ‘The joy of the Lord is your strength.’ The Lord ‘lias given us an understanding of his word’ and continues to graciously ‘feed us upon food that is convenient’, (Neb. 8:10,12; Prov. 30:8) The kingdom is here and progresses, and our business is to sing forth the praises of Jehovah God and, as his witnesses, to bear testimony to his name. (Isa. 12:3-6; 43:10-12) October 1-9 inclusive is therefore named and designated as Kmydtwi </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony Period.</span><span class="font1"> Let the companies of God’s people in various communities hold a. service convention beginning Friday evening previous; then let the period of nine days following be devoted to service, this to be a period of joyful thanksgiving, praise and service unto Jehovah God, a feast to the prosperous kingdom work. In that period of time every one of Jehovah’s witnesses, so far as it is possible, should participate in giving testimony and praise to Jehovah and to his kingdom by bearing the fruits of the kingdom to others who desire to hear.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As stated in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Wa left tower, </span><span class="font1">companies should arrange for service conventions in the various communities, and the first meeting of the convention should be on Friday evening.

<p><span class="font1">auxiliaries averaged 22.78, or 2.78 hours move than their quota called for. The pioneers averaged 40.28 hours, which is almost 5 hours less than the quota called for. Taking everything into consideration, this has been the best showing of hours lliat we have ever attained to in a nine-day period.

Au effort should be made to overcome this, not so much for the sake of placing more books or booklets (that should not be the motive), but rattier that the magnitude of the available knowledge of Jehovah placed in the hands of the people might be increased.

For the month of .Tune the weekly reports Show many of the pioneers devoted forty to fifty hours, and even a greater number of hours, each week. This had the effect of raising the total hours spent in the field, and consequently the average of all the pioneers. The average time for pioneers during the month of June was 26.10 hours each per week. This does not mean th a t every pioneer spent that much time in the field, for there are still some not devoting 2G hours each week to the service, for one reason or another. Their lack is made up for by other pioneers who are putting forth extra efforts to discharge their commission as “full-time” witnesses for Jehovah. It is due to the efforts of these brethren who are putting In many more hours per week than 1he minimum that the average of the pioneers has, for the first time this year, exceeded the minimum requirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since the summer and fall season presents the most favorable weather for house-to-house witnessing, and as conditions grow worse among the people, it is hoped that the pioneer witnesses, refreshed and strengthened by the rich food with which the Lord lias fed them, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">'Vindication</span><span class="font1"> Two and Three, will carry on with greater vigor and enthusiasm. There arc mtdiy pioneers who have been in the field for a long time, putting forth valiant efforts to honor the name of Jehovah, and it is noted (hat they are not the ones who have caused the pioneer average to be lower than it; should be. Rather It is those who have more recently entered the pioueor work who are not yet really devoting all their time to witnessing. Evidently some of these newer pioneers feel that having cut loose fromifiocular and other ties and being enrolled as pioneers constitutes all that is required of them. As a matter of fact that is merely the preliminary step preparatory to becoming a pioneer. A pioneer is one of Jehovah’s witnesses who spends all his time in fulfilling his divinely given commission, ‘This gospel of the kingdom must be preached.’ As in the case of Ezekiel, the Lord grants an Individual the opportunity, and. to be faithful, one must immediately become active in seizing upon the opportunity of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The results accomplished by the pioneers as a whole during the month of June arc extremely encouraging, and should cause all the pioneers to go forward with a renewed determination to put forth an even greater effort, especially those who will see that they have been letting their brethren bear the brunt of the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah richly blessed the work of the pioneer witnesses; for the report shows they placed 80,641 clothbound books and 157,065 booklets, with 346,781 persons. They spent a total of 171,406 hours in witnessing to 552,220 people. As compared with the work of the same month last year, approximately 50,000 more hours were devoted to witnessing by pioneers this June than last. This is because of the far greater number ot' pioneers. During June reports were received from 1,772 pioneers. However, there were some 102 additional who were delinquent in that no weekly reports were received from the.m during the month. It is hoped that these will endeavor to quickly remove the obstacles which have hindered them and get busy at once in Jehovah’s service. Time and again </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> has stressed the fact that NOW the witness must be quickly given, and blessed are those privileged to have part therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is of great interest to noIe how many complete sets of clothbound books are being placed by the pioneers, as well as combinations of four clothbound books. During June alone 35,882 books were placed in combinations of either four or ten, and many additional in combinations of six or eight books to those who had the rest of the books. This is a clear indication of the extent of the interest and desire on the part of the people for the Kingdom message, and should encourage Ilie pioneers to always offer the clothbound books. Also, it will be an inspira tion to the brethren as they prepare to go forth during the INAUGURAL </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">VINDICATION'</span><span class="font1"> TESTIMONY PERIOD, September 3, 4 and 5: for it: will show them the opportunity that exists to place a great number of sets of VtH-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dication</span><span class="font1"> One, Two and Three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneers continue to report how greatly Brother Rutherford’s radio lectures aid them in their work, and prepare the people for their call. One of the brethren reports placing 34 books and 18 booklets, 2 Bibles and 2 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> subscriptions, as a result of one call upon people who had been listening to the lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Due to the financial condition of the people, pioneers witnessing in the business sections of cities are placing literature for contributions of various articles of merchandise which they are ahle to make good use of. In many instances brethren in the local companies are able to use these articles and thus cooperate with the pioneers in their work. It is suggested that the directors of companies where pioneers are witnessing take immediate steps to aid the pioneers in disposing of contributions so received. It is found that in many stores it is possible to leave the literature for articles of clothing, bats, food such as crackers, cheese, and all sorts of canned goods, soap, etc. These are all staple articles which the brethren use and they can. readily be disposed of to the members of the local company on a fair basis (O' both the pioneer disposing of it and the recipient. Ono pioueer reports receiving handmade sheets, pillow eases, towels, scarfs, cookies and other things ns. contributions for the literature. Another reports'receiving meal tickets on a good restaurant, and live ducks which were in turn disposed of in exchange for milk and cream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Heretofore accepting contributions of foodstuffs and other things has been confined to the country sections, but now it is found that this is extending to the lurge cities as well us small towns. It all indicates that</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">June One of the Best Months in a Long While</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Auxiliaries Should Try to Place More Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are some auxiliaries who spend almost twice as much time iu , the field witnessing as many others do. 'These brethren really appreciate the opportunity of service that Jehovah has graciously placed before them, and are joyfully taking advantage of It. It is their reports of long hours spent in the field during June that has raised the average shown of the whole list of auxiliaries to 11.97 hours per week for Hi at month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There were 903 auxiliary witnesses enrolled at the end of June, and they reported a total of 37,390 hours in the Held, delivering 148,408 testimonies, placing 10,529 books and 32,224 booklets. These figures indicate that a good witness was accomplished, but they also show that a greater one is possible with the present number of auxiliaries provided each otic devoted at least 12 hours per week to the service. If this had been done during June the average would have bceu far more than 12 hours a week, because many actually spent far more lime than this in the field. The placements and testimonies would have increased accordingly, and the auxiliary witnesses would have enjoyed increased privileges of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While the auxiliary witnesses deliver about 20 i&gt;crceiit more testimonies per hour than do the pioneers, the records show that their work is not as efficient. Auxiliaries ' during June placed approximately one-half as many books per hour, and not as many booklets per hour, as did the pioneers, it is suggested that the auxiliaries should put forth</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sharpshooters — Directors</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Are YOU Reporting as Required ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the average, each month 50 to 100 sharpshooters fail to send in l.hcir reports on time or forget to make them out and need to be specially requested Io send in their reports. In months in which there arc special periods this average is increased to 150 to 200, due to the failure to promptly report for the where there Is an interest and desire for the Kingdom message there usually is some means of obtaining it. One pioueer witnessing In a section where nothing else was to be had as contributions, has been accepting parts from unused cars, such as radiators and storage batteries. These he disposes of to junk yards, and so is able to keep on in singing forth Jehovah’s praises,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One pioneer advises that he is taking advantage of a field for witnessing that has heretofore not received attention in that he is witnessing to drivers of delivery cars, milkmen and such like, as lie meets them in his housc-to-house work. He finds these quite receptive, since their work gives them ample opportunity lo observe how grave conditions really are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">'These suggestions are mentioned to aid tbe pioneers in their all-important work of singing forth Jehovah’s praises. an effort to increase their placements of literature, and realize that merely delivering the verbal testimony is not sufficient. The most effective witness is accomplished where the printed message of the Kingdom is left with the one who has received the verbal testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Also, the auxiliaries placed literature in the form of sets of four or ten bound books to only about onetenth of the number placed by pioneers. Since the auxiliaries as a whole devoted about one-fifth as much time, ns did the pioneers, they should have placed approximately one-fifth ns many sets of clothbound books In combinations.. The fact that they did not is another proof that the more time one devotes to the work of door-to-door witnessing, the more he increases the efficiency of his witnessing and consequently enlarges the number of books and booklets placed. It is suggested Hint the auxiliaries make a strong al.lenipt to take the fullest advantage of each call they make, striving to leave as much of the primed message concerning the Kingdom as is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah (ins provided the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">VINDICATION</span><span class="font1"> TESTIMONY PERIOD, September 3, 4 and 5, and this will afford an excellent opportunity for each auxiliary to make a fresh start and endeavor to spend as much of his time in witnessing as is possible, and to place as many of the sets of three </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> books as he can. Tho pioneer enrollment list la continually growing, and many brethren are rfoqtmsiing to be transferred from the auxiliary ranks to those of the pioneers. Undoubtedly It is Ilie desire of each auxiliary to be a &quot;full-time” witness if that were possible, and so as each one’s efficiency in witnessing grows 11. may, by Jehovah’s grace, pave the way for pioneer privileges.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">'special period or the previous month or for both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Hie case of service directors of companies there are, on an average, 59 directors who fail to report for the SHORT WEEK prior to the special periods. With this ONE exception, the dlreclors arc reporting very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This CARELESSNESS on the part of some sharpshooters and service directors not only causes unnecessary work and loss of time which ciiuld be well dcvoled to other activities, but also means that each month from $3.00 lo $8.00 is needlessly spent for postage and supplies to remind the sharpshooters (in particular) and service directors to make out their reports as required and already Instructed to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let each service director and particularly each sharpshooter carefully read over the report card instructions, taking special notice of that part after the heading “FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS&quot;, and then arrange to make out the reports accordingly. We know that with a little care and a little bit of your time you can make out your reports REGULARLY, PROMPTLY, and COMPLETELY.</span></p>

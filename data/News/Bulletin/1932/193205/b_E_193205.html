<p><span class="font3">A'ow 1* </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the Time to Begin Pioneer Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the winter months many brethren have been awaiting iimre favorable weather conditions as a good lime to begin the pioneer work. They have been settling their affairs, preparatory to getting into liie living line. Now that spring has arrived, they are joyfully entering the fulltime service of Jehovah, with increased privileges of singing forth his praises. There are already 1,802 pioneers participating in Jehovah’s service, and their ranks are steadily growing. At this season of the year weather conditions are belter, roads are in good shape to begin work in the rural ami outlying sections, and usually better physical health is enjoyed, its compared with wintertime. Those who know Jehovah, observing the condition of the people and their great need to hear the Kingdom message telling whence their relief is to come, desire greatly to fulfil completely their commission as Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are many brethren participating in the witness itt their spare lime as members of the various companies and as sharpshooters. If they were free from all secular duties and cures, and could devote till their time to honoring the name of Jehovah, their effectiveness as witnesses would great ly increase and Jehovah's praises would be sounded more widely. This is demonstrated by comparing the results obtained by the pioneers and auxiliaries with those of the company workers and sharpshooters during the recent International Thanksgiving Testimony Period. There were 2,4®) pioneers and auxiliaries in the field, and they iie-coinplishetl almost: ns much ns the I 1,1 55 spa re-time workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thore are some brethren desirous </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">becoming pioneers tint who arc waiting unt.il they can obtain auto- ■ mobiles in which to get about. Of course, an auto is of great assistance when it is in running order, but there are a great number of brethren in the pioneer service who have been carrying on for years and doing valiant service who have never had an auto to work with. Possibly if they had waited until they got a car they would stilt be only hoping to become pioneers, whereas by going ahead they have enjoyed years of great privileges in honoring Jehovah's name. Some of these walk nmny miles each day in Jehovah's service, and count it a privilege to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Others are endeavoring to accumu</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">late </span><span class="font3">a sizable sum of money upon which to live while in the pioneer service. This is not the proper viewpoint at all, and those who go into the pioneer service on that basis usually last but a month or two as (Continued on page 2, column 4)</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font3">The figures covering Ilse activities of the pioneers, auxiliaries, company workers mid sharpshooters for the first six months of 1932 compared wilh (hose of the same period of 193J illustrate the fact stilted in the opening scripture of the May 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> better than words could ever do; “Blessed be the Sovereign Lord I day by day he cnrriel.ti the load for us: God himself is our salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When we started the fiscal year 1932. last October, eleven and one-half niillion testimonies looked like a t renienrlous load. A weekly average of 7,090 workers we thought was even a bigger load, and we wondered if it could be attained and if, should we get that many, they would put in 3,ioO,000 hours during the year and place 7,290,000 pieces of literature. Everyone who has given this matter any serious thought, will ennc-ede that those figures represent :i real load, a tremendous, superhuman load. However, the Lord had demonstrated his ability to carry the load for his people in the past: so the anointed, with the assurance from Jehovah that we can do nil things through Christ who</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">strengtheneth us, went, forward in faith to do the best they could and</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">left, the results with the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is questionable, however, if even the inost optimistic or iliose with the strongest faith were prepared for the thrilling story the table of the past six months’ activities tells. The past six months witnessed hard times unparalleled in the history of this country; and four of the six months were winter months, consequently the most clifii-&lt;mlt for witnessing. Yet despite all this, we maintained a weekly average of 7,914 workers, or 914 more than we hardly dared to hope for at the beginning of the year. We have ; already reached 72 percent of our testimonies quota, indicating that we shall be closer to the twenty million mark at the end of the year than to the eleven and one-half million that we originally expected. We have attained 57 percent of our hours, and practically 5(1 percent of the total of pieces of literature. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Surely everyone can say wi th grat-1 itude, 'The Sovereign Lord is bear-' lug our load and giving ns the vie- I lory.’ The outstanding indication of the magnitude of the witness for this year is shown in the number of homes receiving the kingdom mes-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">sage: 2,028,257, This is over twice as many homes as received the message during t’ne same time in 1931. Also, in this year’s witness work </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">friends participated more consistently than ever before, with an average increase of almost 1,200 workers a week over last year, and the workers that were out this year averaged 1^ hours a week more than the workers did lust year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These are just a few of the outstanding points. We could go on at length discussing the wonderful testimony those figures depict, and which you yourselves can see at a glance in the table below, and which is positive evidence that the Lord has brought forth his war equipment which knows no defeat and is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">now </span><span class="font3">going forward to positive victory. Blessed indeed is the lot of the anointed now to have some part </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">this glorious work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is one point, however, which might be termed the weak link in our chain and which we believe it well lo consider here, and that is the number of hound books placed. In the bound books we have reached only 37 percent of our quota for the year. That means that we have 63 percent yet to go in the next six months. However, there is some reason for this. Considerable time was devoted to the different campaigns with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet, serving notice on the rulers, etc., which took a lot of time from the bound books (Continued on page 2, column 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">200,000-Honr Testimony Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Let’s Keep It in Mind, July 2 to 10</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How Much of Your Time Will Be Used in Witnessing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Rutherford lias designated July 2 to July 10 as the 200,000-HOUR TESTIMONY PERIOD. Jehovah’s witnesses will desire to prepare, so that they will be all ready to take the fullest advantage of the opportunity to glorify and honor the name of Jehovah by bearing TESTIMONY to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During that season of the year good weather usually prevails, which will enable Jehovah’s witnesses to devote as much time as possible to the field work, and a quota has been set at 200,060 hours for that TESTIMONY period. During the recent International Thanksgiving Testimony Period Jehovah's witnesses in the United States devoted 110,668 hours to bearing TESTIMONY. From this it is seen that each witness will have to put forth a determined strenuous effort, so that, by the grace of Jehovah, the utmost in bearing testimony may be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is hoped that by July 2 there ’.-.-ill Jie 2,0(19 pioneers in tiie field. od of tills year, when we had 13,624 workers. This is nn increase of 37 percent over Midwinter Week in 1931 and 78 percent over </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy </span><span class="font3">Week in 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another point is the amount of time each worker devoted to the service. We had one day less in the International Thanksgiving Testimony period this year than we had in the former periods, due to the fact that it did not commence until Sunday. Naturally this reduced the time that the workers had to devote to the service, but even in this the average time per worker exceeded that of 1930, although it did come short about au hour and a half compared with 1931. These facts all indicate that the Lord’s people are appreciating their privileges more than ever before. I</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">n Jj</span><span class="font3">ct, the number of workers fdlWlnternational Thanksgiving Testimony Period exceeded anything that we hud up to the present time. This is our peak to date, and when we realize that this has taken place in the midst of the winter, with rain, sleet and intense cold, in the Bast and North particularly, some Idea of the possibility of 1932 is brought home to us. During this period regional service directors and other brethren advise that in some sections to the northand if for the 8-day period from July 2 to 10 they would each devote 5 hours a day to witnessing they would achieve a total of 80,000 hours in Jehovah’s service. If for that period one thousand auxiliaries witness for 2$ hours a day they will have devoted a total of 20,000 tu.iurs In honoring the name of Jehovah. And if 11,500 witnesses from the ranks of the companies apd sharpshooters could devote a total of but 9 hours each for the whole 8-dny period, it would mean that they' participated in giving testimony for a. total of 103,500 hours; and thus for the three divisions a grand total of 203,500 hours will be reached. If it is borne in mind that this period will present a wonderful opportunity to henor Jehovah’s name, that It conies at a season when most time can be utilized, Jehovah’s witnesses will more than attain the quota indicated. It is suggested that the brethren everywhere join in prayer to the end that their united efforts during the 200,000-HOUR TESTI</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MONY PERIOD </span><span class="font3">may redound to Jehovah’s praise in the greatest pos-west entire companies were sick in bed with the grippe and unable to go out in the service at all and, in other cases, feeble and infirm brethren are handicapped considerably in the wintertime so that they cannot do as much as they would like. With the advent of the spring weather, when the sun is shining, the roads are open, and all the friends can get out, there is not a shadow of doubt that we shall exceed the estimated peak of 14,000 workers very early.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The vital fact that all who partake of the symbolic cup at Memorial should be consistent and true to that which they symbolize and partake of the real cup which the Lord pours for his people regularly Is home home with greater weight to the Lord's people cacti year. This becomes a very vital issue with each one now'. The time for fear, indifference or compromise is past. Each one must now take his stand wholly and completely on the Lord's side, and undoubtedly all are doing this. The heart attitude of the anointed is getting more and more to be that expressed by Hie psalmist when he says, “I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of tiie Loud. I will pay my vows unto tiie Lord now in the presence of all his people.”</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">sible measure. Then let all prepara-I tions proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In many parts of the country there are sections which cannot be reached in the winter months. Durlag the favorable weather of July 2 to 10, these outlying parts, including the rural districts and small coimtry towns, should he visited and the TESTIMONY delivered to everyone residing therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Also, it is suggested that each one’s stock of literature be examined and that anv literature needed for this 200,000-HDUR TESTIMONY PERIOD be ordered soon. Thus, if Lite territory is mapped out, and a supply of literature is at hand, each one will be in position to do his part, and. by the grace of Jehovah, a wide witness may be effected.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">(Continued from page 1, column 4) and naturally cut down the number. The time has now come, however, to recognize this fact and to put forth every effort to overcome this handicap. It will mean a consistent and strenuous pushing of the bound books during the next six months. We believe, however, that if each one puts forth the effort wc can overcome most of this handicap, if not all. Therefore, let the slogan be, ‘Push the four books for .$1.00 contribution, and after you have pushed them push them some more,’ and then commence pushing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Continued from page 1, column 1) pioneers. Of course, it is well, if possible, to have an emergency fund to cover unexpected situations, but those taking up the pioneer sei'vice should do so with full confidence tn Jehovah, seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, confident that all “these things” will be added unto them. This does not mean that merely having one’s name enrolled as a pioneer is sufficient. It means that those who are wholeheartedly in the Lord’s service, and who are really putting in all their time in the field service actually bearing testimony from house to house, are enjoying great privileges and placing the greatest quantity of literature, and thus effecting the widest witness. The Society supplies the literature Io pioneers at much less than the actual cost of production and delivery, and this is for the purpose of enabling pioneers to meet expenses incurred In the work of bearing testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some brethren perhaps are hesitating to enter the pioneers' ranks for fear of being unable to meet their expenses. The best answer to that is in the fact that many of the pioneers have been in the service as such for the past five, ten or twenty years. They arranged their affairs so as to do away with all unnecessary expenditures, and took their stand for Jehovah, and enrolled in his service for all time, looking to him with confidence for the things needful. The tacts show their confidence in Jehovah has not been misplaced. Those who know Jehovah desire to obey his commands. Those who are thus hesitating should carefully consider the Lord’s words in Luke 12: 16-38, and take action accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Others have perhaps felt that they did not possess what they termed 'natural ability’ to make good as pioneers. In this they are looking at the matter from the wrong viewpoint. Jehovah uses those in his service who are whole-heartedly devoted to him mid who obey his commands. (Jolin 15:1-11) Christ Jesus is the vine, and all the members of his body are the branches, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font3"> bear kingdom fruits if they abide in him, keeping his commandments in love. Unselfish devotion to Jehovah ami a desire to honor his name are the requirements for the pioneer service, and not any so-called ‘natural ability'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conditions now existing among the people are extremely propitious for preaching the gospel. Institutions in which the people have heretofore had confidence, and to which they looked for security, are failing them now in their time of need, anti the future looks dark. The only remedy is Jehovah and his kingdom, and it Is the happy lot of Jehovah’s witnesses to be able to tell of the near destruction of the entire organization of Satan, and of the happiness which will come when the meek of the earth have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah and join in honoring his name. The pioneers arc a happy company, and in their ranks it is hoped that many others of the Lord’s witnesses will find increased opportunities and privileges of honoring the name of Jehovah. Now Is a good time to begin the pioneer work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Only 3&lt;/<sub>2</sub> Hours per Day?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the month of March the pioneers averaged only 26.93 hours per week in active field witnessing, and the auxiliaries 10.5 hours. This means that many hours of witnessing were lost, and it is strongly urged Ihat each one </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">do his or </span><span class="font3">her utmost, to make up this lost time. It is hoped that pioneer and auxiliary reports will show a greatly increased number of hours spent in singing forth Jehovah’s praises.</span></p>

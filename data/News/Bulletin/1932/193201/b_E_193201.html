<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Books Placed Is Best</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The light shining upon the Kingdom privileges and requirements is such that daily the issue assumes a clearer and deeper meaning. A few years back the examination of our progress was considered almost entirely from the standpoint of the amount of literature placed, ft became evident, as the issue clarified, that this could not be the determining factor, for two reasons: First, it was not entirely Scriptural; and, second, it was not reasonable, and our God is both consistent and reasonable. The fact was gradually borne home to us that we are Jehovah’s witnesses, not his book agents in an;<sup>1</sup> sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The work of a witness is to give testimony; and that is why the Kingdom work daring recent years is forecast in testimonies rather than on the amount of literature placed. As members of the anointed, we can and should hold ourselves responsible for the number of testimonies we give; but we cannot hold ourselves responsible for the amount of literature placed, because that is affected by too many tilings beyond our control. The Apostle Paul admonishes the Lord’s people to present their bodies a living sacrifice, wholly and acceptable unto God. This means being his witnesses by giving testimony on the question at issue, and the apostle says this is our reasonable service. It is a reasonable service. It is up to us whether we are doing this to the extent of our ability or not. However, giving testimony is not a mechanical proposition. The anointed arc living sacrifices; indicating that their faculties are alive and alert to the requirements of the work assigned to them. The manner and method of giving the testimony will manifest the degree of faithfulness on the part of the creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One may figure that the best testimony is Iris own verbal presentation of the Kingdom truth. .Another may think that reading the testimony appearing in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> to as many people as possible is the best way to testify; and another may just recite the testimony, parrot-like, to as many as possible, and that would be his conception of a proper testimony. Still another may deliver the testimony convincingly and feel that that is all that is required. All these methods lack the vital spark and indicate that to some extent at least those using them do not really know Jehovah. The first testimony considers the witness and his importance; the second manifests an indifference and carelessness; the third is simply doing one’s duty according to the letter of the requirement,' and the fourth indicates that the (Continued on page 2, column 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the Bound Book Testimony Period the Bethel family will have the privilege of engaging in this work the first Saturday and Sunday and also the last Saturday and Sunday of this special period. The factory and office will be closed all day Saturday in order that the entire Bothel family can share in the privilege of witnessing to the people with the bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society will be glad to send service leaders to companies requesting visits from them within a radius of 300 miles from Brooklyn. These appointments wall be for either the first or the last two days of the special testimony period.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">It will be greatly appreciated if the brethren, when writing letters to the Society, put their name and address in the upper left-hand corner on each letter. ’The name of the city alone is not sufficient address, and it will expedite matters very considerably if the street address is indicated on each letter. If there is no street or post, office box number, but the address is General Delivery, please so indicate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Workers Should Be Well Prepared to Deliver Their Testimony </span><span class="font1">Are you ready for the Bound Book Testimony Period? Is your territory properly charted off? Have you arranged for the transportation of those friends who are going to work outside points? Have convenient depots for literature and meeting places for the workers been arranged for in towns and sections you arc going to work? Have all captains been thoroughly instructed and appointed so that they have the details of what is required of them '.veil in mind? These arc only a few of the questions that enter into the necessary preparations for a successful witnessing period. The size of the company, the territory to be worked, the number of workers available, and other such points ns these, enter into the necessary preparation, but the service committee that is really on the alert and anxious to make a success out of this testimony period will go into all these features very carefully and make the required arrangements in advance.</span></p>

It should be used every day you go into the field service. Cheek up on your weak points and take the results of your investigation back to the service meeting. Tell the friends there what you found out; and in this way go over it, cooperating one with another until it is really a. workable proposition. Some have inquired if they can mention the radio or Judge Rutherford in their testimony. That is perfectly ail right. You can start your testimony like this: ''No doubt you have heard dudge Rutherford, who lectures and broadcasts over more than 300 stations each week. As be well says, 'the people need a righteous government ’ ”; and then continue bility of using this testimony as outlined, thinking it is unnecessary. There are a number of reasons why plied with this outline, we can arrange a proper and effective defense. These are vital points now because of the determined opposition by the adversary and his agents, and &quot;it is therefore imperative that this outnumber of letters have been received from companies, auxiliary and pioneer workers who find that when they have finished this testimony their prospect is interested, but not enough to take the books, and they ask, &quot;Are we lawless if we continue after thia testimony is completed, by displaying the books, calling attention the pictures, Scriptural indexes or the alphabetical indexes, which we have been accustomed to doing in the past with some success?” To such we say</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">: Lt</span><span class="font1"> you have opened up with the recommended testimony so that the work and the object of your call are properly presented, and the interest of your prospect warrants</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Business Districts Are Pioneer Territory 132,066 Rulers Reached in North America</span></h3>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">If Company Wishes to Work Their Own Business Territory, Notify the Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What Is “Business Territory”?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Manifestly it is nut only to the interests of the work in general for all territory to be thoroughly covered, but to the interests of the pioneers themselves, as they will not have to move so often. Business districts are part of pioneer assignments, and we encourage those who hold assignments not in. company territory to thoroughly cover the business sections before the assignment is turned back to this office. Business districts have proven to be a fruitful field for many pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In company and sharpshooter territory the business districts are open for pioneers who cannot go to isolated territory. Business districts are not to be covered by the company workers </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">unless the service director or sharpshooter makes a special request</span><span class="font1"> stating that the company workers can cover the business sections, and receives the business district assignment from this office. Auxiliaries wishing to work generally in business districts should get a special assignment from this office, as do the pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Business districts refer not only to retail stores, but also to offices, factories, water fronts, in fact, all but the residential territory of a city. Tn many places there are streets of stores with apartments above. The rows of stores are business districts; the apartments above are residential. Often, away ftota the main, downtown businesses, arc groups of business houses of all kinds, and these also are included in the term “business districts”, and are pioneer territory unless the company specially requests them. What about the isolated neighborhood stores, those located by themselves throughout the residential sections? The service directors should see that these are witnessed to, and the best way would be for the worker having the . adjoining residences to take these little stores as he comes to them. Sometimes directors report that business districts are covered, when only some of the first-floor stores are entered, offices, etc., above being untouched; but these professional men are included in business districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> Reduced</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark21"></a>to 30c January 30</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark23"></a>To Be Used in Four-for-a-Dollar Combination</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">On January 1 the company and auxiliary rates on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> will be changed to correspond to those on the other books. All invoices on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> made out in this office on and after January 1 will be made out at the new rate. The change of price to the public will become effective Jan-nary 30, the first day of the Bound Book Testimony Period. The amount asked for the book from the public will be 30c. In this way it will be possible to include it in the four-for-a-dollar combination with any of the other books, and with the other nine books for $2.50. This reduction will aid in placing an. increased number of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> book, for which we thank the Lord.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark25"></a>THE NEW CATALOG </span><span class="font4">Can Be Used</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark27"></a>in Witness Work</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">About January 15 the Society' will have completed the publication of a revised catalog. It will be practically the same as the one used last year, with a few additions for the new books. A new colored insert will appear in the middle, which will give a better display of the books published by the Society than the previous one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many of the friends have found this catalog a real help in placing the literature by using it the same as they would a prospectus. Some of the sisters and older brothers find it impossible to carry a full set of the ten bound books and all the booklets when witnessing from door to door. They have found that by carrying a few of the books with this catalog they have been able to place complete sets of ten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society publishes the catalog primarily for answering radio inquiries. All listeners desiring to know more about our work and the literature we publish are mailed a copy of this catalog, and it has proved effective in. this manner. It can be used not only in answer to radio inquiries, but as a prospectus, and the Society is pleased to offer these booklets to the friends at cost of production. They can again be had at two for 5c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We should very much appreciate it if the director of each company would order at one time the number the workers desire for their use, with some order for books, so as to save shipping charges. The same would be well for the pioneers and auxiliaries also.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Testimony Booklets</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">A Convenience for Every Worker </span><span class="font1">A request has been made several times for a testimony to be printed in different languages. The Society is now preparing to have the testimony we now have for bound books printed in several different languages in a small 16-pago folder. On each page there will appear in a different , language an exact translation of the English testimony, which will appear on the first page of this booklet. These little booklets will be shipped during January to all companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries, for their use when meeting people speaking languages other than they can speak. This little booklet should he supplied to each worker, so that when witnessing in a certain territory and meeting, for example, an Italian who cannot understand English, all that is necessary is to turn to the page in the testimony booklet marked “Italian” and request the one who answers at the door to read the testimony in his own language. If interested you can either take an order or, if you have the literature in the language required with you, leave some of the books. In this manner there will be a greater witness given among the foreign-speaking people in this conn-try than heretofore.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark31"></a>SPANISH WORK</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Many pioneers and auxiliaries who are working in Texas and other southern states in which Spanish, is spoken by some people can now obtain all the clothbound books, except </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font1"> in that language. We also have ten Spanish booklets in stock, as well as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> booklet in magazine form, for work among the Spanish people.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">Supplementary Report on Rulers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Above is a tabulation showing the report of the placements with the clergymen, politicians, financiers and military rulers both in the United States and in Canada and giving the total so far reported for all of North America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was the privilege of the Lord’s people, as Jehovah’s witnesses, to carry this notice of warning to these rulers, and it was done in obedience to Jehovah’s commands. All of the anointed rejoice in having had this privilege and are glad they had a part therein. Possibly, before undertaking this work, especially of calling on the preachers, some of the Lord’s people had a small lurking feeling of sympathy for these men, but surely, after an opportunity of calling upon so many of them and seeing the spirit that was manifest by the majority of them, and what kind of flock of ‘ ‘ roosters ’ ’ they are, we can understand that, as always, the Lord is right. Perhaps heretofore some have not understood the full weight of Jehovah God’s condemnation of these men, but after noticing, in calling upon them, their oily, sanctimonious manner upon first receiving their callers and then, upon identifying the object of the call, their immediate change into one of the utmost hatred and venom, we know without a shadow of doubt that they are indeed of their father the Devil and that there is no truth in them. (John 8:42-45) Because some thought they were called upon to receive a visit to gossip or, perhaps, to receive a fee for a baptism or wedding, they showed a pleasant expression, but immediately upon identifying the message they lost control of themselves and became abusive. They were willing to talk about petty, unimportant matters of their own, but when it came to Jehovah God and his kingdom they did not wish to have anything to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are sure that in addition to accomplishing the purpose that Jehovah wished to accomplish by this warning to these men, it was a revelation to the Lord’s people and showed them what the clergy really' are and what their fate will be. (Matt. 23: 27; Jcr. 13: 13-27.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(Continued from page 1, column 4) your doing so, make such demonstration. of the books, their Scriptural references, indexes or pictures as you may find necessary in order to convince your prospect, so long as your presentation is consistent with the original testimony and in no wise nullifies or alters the position that it establishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You will also note in another part of this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> that, commencing January 30, the beginning of the Bound Book Testimony Period, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> is to be included in combinations offered to the public at 4 for $1.00, or 10 for $2.50. This will make the bound book presentation the most desirable proposition of which anyone can conceive. The message that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> book contains has been assimilated by each one of the Lord’s anointed before now and, recognizing the positive declaration of Jehovah’s judgment it contains, which every intelligent creature on earth should be aware of now, it should be the greatest inspiration to each one of the Lord’s anointed to devote his or her every faculty to</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">(Continued from page 1, column 1) witness thinks that what he says, and the way he says it, is the important thing. It may be necessary to use one or all of these methods under certain circumstances, and they would really be a testimony under those conditions, if nothing else could bo done; but Jehovah says that we are his witnesses that he is God. Therefore our ultimate object, the ideal testimony, should be to reveal Jehovah, his word, his name and his purposes to our listeners in the most complete way possible. The oral testimony reveals him to a degree. Placing booklets reveals him to a greater degree; and the bound books, which explain his Word to a greater extent, are undoubtedly the best testimony. Therefore the hast witnesses of Jehovah are not satisfied to simply read, recite or deliver their testimony, or even to leave a few booklets. Their great objective always is to leave the bound books in the hands of the people. However, if the oral testimony is all that they can leave, well and good; and if they can place a few booklets, so much the better; but their real objective is to testify that Jehovah is God in the best way possible, and this can be best accomplished by leaving the bound books in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore, let us all be witnesses of Jehovah and bear testimony on the great issue, “Who is God?’’ Let us always strive for the ideal testimony, that is, leaving the bound books, and be thankful for what we are able to accomplish by the Lord’s grace, whether it be an oral testimony, a booklet, or a complete set of bound books.</span></p>

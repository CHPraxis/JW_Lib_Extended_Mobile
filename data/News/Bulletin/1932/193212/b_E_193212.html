<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">THOSE WHO KNOW JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Will Bear Testimony</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Are You Doing Thu?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Eighteen million testimonies given In one year's time is a lot of witnessing. During the year 1932 there were 16,434,258 testimonies given by the companies, pioneers and auxiliary workers. This means an increase for the coming year of a little more than a million and a half test! monies. Jehovah’s witnesses have so constantly increased their effort to magnify ttio name and word of Cod in the earth that we feel certain that those who know Jehovah will Increase their effort and time and will put forth great zeal for the King and the Kingdom during the coining year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah has richly blessed his people, because in bearing this testimony the Lord’s people not only had the privilege of telling the listeners of the Kingdom, but in the majority of cases a testimony was left with them in permanent form. Either a elothbound book or a booklet &quot;was left with the people who were witnessed to, and this is the best form in which to deliver the testimony. If a book or a booklet is on the living-room table, after you are gone the parly can pick this up and begin to investigate and to examine the scriptures that are quoted or cited and they will find there an argument presented which will prove beyond any question of doubt that God’s kingdom is the only hope of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is hoped that while bearing testimony during the coming year the company workers, sharpshooters and auxiliaries will make a special effort to place the booklets in the hands of the people in the densely populated areas. Of course, where the people have sufficient funds the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vintli&amp;ition</span><span class="font2"> books should be left with them, the three fur a contribution of 75c, or the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lii/ht</span><span class="font2"> books, One and Two. Of course, where all tlie bound books can be placed this should be done, but so important is the message in the recent publications that special effort should be made to leave these as the testimony. The pioneers are going to concentrate on books because this is the most permanent form for leaving the witness, and, further, the Lord has made provision for tite pioneers recently, as is explained elsewhere in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hulietiu,</span><span class="font2"> so that they can carry on In the work and place these bound books with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ail we ask as a contribution for a book is a quarter. We believe many more books will lie placed during the year because of this arrangement. The Lord has done (Continued on page 3, column 4)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Sixteen million, four hundred and thirty-four thousand, two hundred and fifty-eight testimonies were given during the fiscal year which ended September 30, 1932! This is truly an amazing total which affords great cause for rejoicing on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses because it far surpasses all expectations. Last fall, in setting a quota for the United Slates and territory under the direct supervision of the Brooklyn office, it was thought that a reasonable figure would be 11,500,000. But Ilie brethren were aroused to their privilege of making known the Kingdom message, and not only far exceeded the quota, but also surpassed last year’s figure by 5,384,914 testimonies. As a result of all these testimonies’ having been given 6,834,433 pieces of literature were placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Bro. Rutherford’s Talks to Be Heard by All Even Though They Have No Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord, through the unfolding of the truth, has made it clear that there is to be a Jehouadab class, who are out of sympathy -with the Devil’s organization and who are looking for, and anxious to avail themselves of, the Lord’s assistance. The majority of these are found not among the wealthy or tlie comfortably situated people of the earth. In fact, a great many of them are among the oppressed and downtrodden who have no means of obtaining tlie message of the Kingdom. They are too poor to own or to maintain a radio receiving set, and in many eases too poor even to contribute the few cents taken for the printed message. They are the poor who deserve consideration. All that many of them Of tins number, 1,640,310 represents bound books, and 5,188,167 booklets. Some of the brethren are under the impression that because of the hard times there has been a great reduction in the total number of bound books placed. You will rejoice in learning that while there have been 70,956 fewer bound books placed than during the previous year, still during 1931 over 100,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> were included in the total and many of these books were given away by the foreign brethren. This therefore means that of Jr books containing the message which is now due to go to the people there has during 1932 actually been an increase In the number placed with the people. The big increase in the number of booklets distributed brings the grand total to 428,077 pieces of literature more than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This increase in the Kingdom interests has come as a result of more of tlie brethren more deeply appreciating the importance of activity in the witness work. The average number of weekly workers has been &lt;8,113, to compare with 6,564, and these have reported 3,961,324 hours in the work, to compare with 2,-know about Jehovah’s witnesses is the garbled misrepresentation put forth through the newspapers by the clergy and other agents of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The antitypical Jehn work Includes assisting these people, for the Lord definitely foretold that they would be considered and helped. To this end the following arrangement is being prepared and advanced in the confident belief that the Lord will bless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society has arranged to procure a portable sound-reproducing outfit which can be connected to any ordinary electric socket for 110-volt alternating current. This machine lias a turntable to play the 33i Rl'M transcriptions of Brother Rutherford’s talks that are regularly broadcast by radio stations in many countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This portable ontfit can be set up in a public park or public square, (Continued ou page 4, column 4) 949,432 hours during 1931, or over a million hours more. While the combinations left with the people have been smaller, more people have obtained the literature. In fact there have been over one and a quarter million more people to lake the literature than during the previous year, the actual figures being 4,579,251 for 1932, ns compared with 3,308,078 for 1931. Surely the Lord is prospering his people in &quot;the land that is brought back from the sword&quot;. It Is this prosperity which arouses the ire of Gog and causes him to assemble his forces to come against the “unwalled villages”. But the remnant, confidently relying upon the promise of Jehovah to deliver them for liis name’s sake, rejoice in seeing the Lord's blessings on their efforts to advance the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An analysis of the work done in the various branches of the work is equally encouraging. The companies, auxiliaries and pioneers all showed a large increase in the number of testimonies given. Tlie companies reported 7,452,519 testimonies, the auxiliaries 2,008,805, and the pioneers 6,972,934. 'The company workers, even though many have left to become pioneers, jumped from an average weekly of 4,733 to 5,739. The pioneers reporting weekly rose from 1,137 l.o 1,611, and the auxiliaries from 691 to 763. In the total literature placed the pioneers showed a good increase in bound books distributed, their total of 1,077,435 comparing very favorably with last year’s figure of 971,013. The companies and auxiliaries decreased in bound books placed, however, the companies dropping from 567,256 to 419,724, and the auxiliaries from 176,003 to 149,157. As previously mentioned, these decreases were In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font2"> and not In the jr publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus by steady, cons!ant work and united effort the anointed of the Lord in ihe United States have had the best year yet and have left the Kingdom message in the hands of more people than ever before so that these may know who is God if it is their desire to investigate. Surely It Is a great cause for rejoicing to see the Kingdom message going out greater than ever in spite of the opposition of the great adversary, in spite of the depression which he has brought upon the people, and in spite of all his efforts to turn all mankind against the great Eternal One. The Lord's people are united for action and they go forward with Jehovah’s great and powerful organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Organization Moves Onward</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Monthly Report Should Show an Average of 6,200 Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Workers, 1,800 Pioneers, 850 Auxiliaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">General Outline of Year’s Work Presented</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is well to make plans for the work of the Lord's people so that the anointed can work together in unity. Tlie plans that are outlined for the year 1933 we believe will be blessed by the Lord, because then-purpose is to advance the Interest of his kingdom. This is his visible organization and ho is using it as his servant in the earth to have a part in the vindication of his name and word- The Lord's people have u most blessed privilege as they bear more and more the fruit of the Kingdom. The longer one travels on the highway, the greater is his appreciation of the Lord’s blessing and favor toward him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The plans for the year 1933 call for increased activity on the part of the remnant. The Quota for the year for the brethren in the United States is set at eighteen million (18,000,000) testimonies. This means that almost every home in the United States should be reached by one of Jehovah’s witnesses sometime during the year. In order to give such a tremendous witness it requires regular activity on the pari, of tlie workers. There has been a constant increase of company workers, pioneers and auxiliaries since 1929. In that year there was an average of 5,142 witnesses weekly in the field. The next year, 1930, the average weekly number of workers was 5,857; in 1931, 6,504; in 1932, 8,113. We anticipate that during the year 1933 the monthly average number of workers engaging in the field service will be as follows: 6,200 company workers, 1,800 pioneers, and 850 auxiliaries, making a grand total of an average of 8,850 workers reporting monthly as being actively engaged in the field work. We hope that there will be more than this, because at different times during the year 1932 a peak was readied of 11,090 different individuals working among the companies and sharpshooters; the pioneers reached a peak of 1,997, and the auxiliaries reached an enrollment of 937. This means that there are nearly 14,000 different individuals that participate in the field witness work. Out of this number surely there should be an average of 8,830 monthly workers. If these workers average the same number of hours during the coming year as they have in the past, we might anticipate that all the workers (pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters and companies) will put in 4,431,000 hours. During rhe year the brethren have averaged a little better than 4 testimonies per hour. This would bring our quota lor the year up to 18,000,000 testimonies, What a witness this will be for the King and the Kingdom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THE UNITED TESTIMONY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the entire year the company workers, sharpshooters and auxiliaries should make a special effort to place the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> hooks, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> 1 and 2, and, later on in the year, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font2"> The other cloth-iimind books should be offered to the people when we see that special interest is shown on their part. However, these particular divisions of the Lord’s army (company- workers, sharpshooters and auxiliaries), in witnessing in their territory, should try to place booklets in every home where it is impossible to place I'ia-</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dication</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font2"> Keep in mind that the more recent literature which we have received contains the message that the Lord wants given to the rulers and the people, because his judgments are made manifest and clearer in these recent publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pioneers, however, should continue placing all of the bound books, especially stressing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> 1, 2 and 3 in a combination upon contribution of 75c. They should continue to place the entire set of 12 books for 83.00 wherever possible ; but with the hard times and oppressive conditions now in the United States it might be well to make a special offer of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> books. When the pioneers cannot place a combination of clothbound literature they should drop to one book and try to place it in every home wherever possible. If this fails, then offer a few booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brother Rutherford has made another very splendid arrangement so that more books and booklets are brought within the means of the people. During this coming year, beginning with December 3, 1932, any one of the elothbouncl books in the English language and written by Brother Rutherford can be placed with the people for a contribution of 25c, or four for a dollar contribution. 'This offer of one bound book for a contribution of 25c will probably increase the distribution of single volumes. Foreign-language books are still placed for a contribution of 35c, or three for a dollar contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another splendid arrangement for the foreign brethren, which will also affect the English brethren, is that all foreign-language booklets are to be offered to the people for a contribution of 5e each, or six for a contribution of 25c. This also is effective December 1, 1932. This means that ail booklets, both English and foreign, can uow be placed with the people at the remarkable offer of a copy for a 5e contribution. This should greatly increase the distribution of the Kingdom message in the booklet form. The English-speaking brethren should keep iu mind, particularly when witnessing among the foreign-speaking people, that we have foreign-language booklets for every language, and an effort should he made to place them with the people, because all must know that Jehovah is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">TESTIMONY PERIODS FOR 1933</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We make mention at this time of the testimony periods that are scheduled for the year 1.933. The details of each one of these will be announced later iu the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> and what special action shall be taken during these periods. The names and dates of these periods are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Servant's Testimony Period Jan. 21-29</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period April 8-16 Ambassador’s Devotional Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">July 1-9</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Kingdom Proclamation Period Sept. 30-Oct. 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah's Witnesses' Praise Period Nov. 18-26</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These special testimony periods have been a great help to many of the friends who have not been able to engage regularly in the weekly field service. They have afforded to many an opportunity to put forth a special effort to magnify the name of the Lord in the earth. They- have helped to create unity of action throughout the entire world, because at this time all of the Lord's anointed arc making a strenuous effort to engage in the field service as one army, ginging forth the Lord’s praises. At all times throughout the year the Lord’s people are bearing testimony, but during these special testimony periods an extra effort is put forth by the lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period and The Kingdom Proclamation Period, a special report will be combined in the Bulletin, giving you the results of the witness accomplished in every land. During these periods the weather conditions are most suitable for a. comparative witness in all parts of the earth, because climatic conditions in the northern and southern hemispheres are then alike and this gives all of the Lord’s people equal opportunity to spend time in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THE TEN CITIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the first Sunday of each month, except the months of July and October, special witness campaigns in the different sections of the United States will be carried on. This affords the brethren everywhere</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers Rejoice Because of Jehovah’s Goodness</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This Will Be of Interest to All the Anointed</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Bible shows that the Lord in dealing with his people deals with them as the “servant” class and that his promises particularly refer to that class. Hence if an individual wishes to receive the special blessings which Jehovah has promised to that class, it is necessary for him to take that course of action whieh Jehovah shows in his Word shall be taken by the “servant”. Jesus promised that those who seek first the interests of God’s kingdom will be provided with those things whieh are necessary for their existence. This, of course, does not mean that they will get everything that they themselves might determine to be necessary, but that which Jehovah sees fit to provide. And now, when times are growing more and more difficult and millions are out of work and do not know whence their next meal is coming, those pioneers who have been in the work for a year or more and who for the twelvemonth period have been faithful in putting in their miuimum time requirements of 25 hours a week or 110 hours a month are to receive special assistance from the Lord’s organization to help them to keep on In the work. an opportunity to come together at one place and carry on a uni led witness in a town where some opposition has been encountered from the authorities or at some other point where a special witness seems advisable. These united efforts once a month will train the brethren to go forth as a fighting unit, and anywhere that opposition may he brought to bear against the Lord's people by the Devil’s organization, the Lord's army upon instructions from headquarters will always be ready to carry on in such vicinities. If the companies are not already organized for this united action, they will be within a few months, according to the schedule in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font2">Every one of the Lord’s people should take an active part in these special Sunday campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord lias given his people much to do, because he says this gospel of the Kingdom must be preached in all the world for a witness, and now the time has come and the Lord has made the arrangements so that it is possible for his people to take this message of the Kingdom to the rulers and the ruled. Every director, every company worker, every sharpshooter, pioneer and auxiliary, should now consider ways and means to increase his activity and his interest in the Kingdom during 1933. The general plans for the united testimony have been outlined by the Society. Now each individual who is a part of that organization whieh the Lord is using should also make plans and arrange to carry on through the coming year. Every effort should be made to increase your hours in the field, and if the time spent in bearing testimony and the fruit of the Kingdom is increa sed, then more literature will be left with the people and a greater witness will be given to the praise of the name and word of Jehovah our God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A special letter written by Brother Rutherford, outlining this special arrangement, was recently mailed to all the pioneers. This provision will also be of interest to those who are interested in the pioneers or who are contemplating entering the work. Therefore we quote the following from Brother Rutherford’s letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“All persons who have been continuously in the pioneer service for one year immediately prior to November 1, 1932, and who have averaged 110 hours per month in the service, will be assisted in the following manner when it seems to the Society that such assistance is necessary and deserving, to wit; Those showing regular service in the pioneer work of 110 to 124 hours per month will receive a credit of 25 hound books. Those serving 125 to 134 hours will receive u credit of 30 bound books. Those working 135 or more hours per month will receive a credit of 35 bound books. When a pioneer is really in need and sends in a report, this will be the basis upon which the assistance will be rendered. Necessary blanks will be sent to each one who may wish to inform the Society at Brooklyn. This fund will have to be made up by contributions from others. We are pleased to inform you that the Bethel family has volunteered to contribute regularly out of their meager allowance to this fund to</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Interest to the Public</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gori's faithful witnesses stand true to him and maintain their integrity toward him. This has been particularly true since 1922. In that time it has been our privilege, as faithful followers of Christ under the supervisory direction of the angels of ihe Lord, to have some part in pouring out God’s vials of reproof and judgments against the ecclesiastics and other portions of Satan’s organization. Not even for expediency’s sake will the true and faithful ones now be branded with the mark of the beast in the forehead or in the hand. The remnant must, and will, be faithful to God and Christ and will continue to boldly tell the truth in this time of judgment. This is going to greatly anger the Devil’s crowd, but it will be a sweet incense unto Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The next testimony period is arranged for January 21-29, and is designated “The Servant's Testimony Period”. The remnant is the only class standing firmly and steadfastly for his name and, therefore, are the ones to take the lead over the highway. The midwinter testimony period calls for more unselfishness, devotion and singleness of purpose than at any other period of the year. Inclement weather, however, is no longer a hindrance to the remnant. Each company, through ttie service director and service committee, each pioneer, auxiliary and sharpshooter, who really has the spirit of Jehovah will make this campaign a. success in the winter as well as in the summer. It will mean that each one will have to plan carefully, dress seasonably, and go forward in the strength of the Lord, and if this is done the Lord will bless one’s efforts with success to the praise of his name.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Reporting Properly?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Read These Questions ■ and Answers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The change in the method of reporting from once every week to once a month has not been clearly understood by all the pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters and company directors, probably because they have not read the former </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font2">article carefully enough. Therefore we are repeating the instructions by answering some questions which have been asked, hoping that in so doing the matter will be cleared up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some have asked if the monthly reports arc in addition to the weekly reports. The answer is No. The monthly reports take the place of the weekly reports, and only one report is required (on the last day of each month) for the entire activities during the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If a spfeial Testimony Period conies within the month, is a separate report to be made out for that period? The answer is Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Is the work done during the Testimony Period to be included in the month's report along with that done during the other weeks? Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Docs that mean that the work done during Testimony Periods will be reported twice, once when the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">special report for the Period only Is</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">The offer to be made during this period will be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font2"> and 13 booklets upon a contribution of 75c. All territory is virgin territory for this offer. This will be the initial public release of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font2"> and it should be presented with enthusiasm and conviction. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation<sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font2">should have an especially strong appeal to the women. It will be read by them, not only with interest, but with a keen appreciation of the manner In which the Lord has been working out his purposes in the past arid their fulfilment at the present time. What could be more absorbing than this book combining intense drama with vital Kingdom truths'? This must not be construed to mean that the book Is by any means uninteresting to men, because the Kingdom truths contained In the vital drama enacted by Mordecai and Esther, and in that by Naomi, Rut.li and Boaz, present the Kingdom message from an angle from which it has never before been presented to the public and which will be appreciated hy all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The booklets, of course, speak for themselves, and undoubtedly the fact that these booklets contain lectures that the people have been hearing over the air every Sunday in Brother Rutherford’s electrical transcription speeches will make them a very desirable thing to all those who have heard his lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Be sure to have a good stock of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font2"> and the 13 new booklets on hand by January 21. Orders for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font2"> can be filled after December 15, 1932. If you get your orders in by that time or later the Society will be able to supply all the companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries for The Servant's Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">made out, and once when added in with the work done for the entire month? Yes. The reason for this is that a special record is being kept of work done during Testimony’ Periods, and another record kept for the monthly activities of each pioneer, auxiliary, sharpshooter and company. The same rule applies to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It. is hoped that with this additional explanation there will be no more difficulty in understanding the correct method of reporting and that from now on each one who has to report direct to the Society will do so correctly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Author’s Edition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Preservation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The author's edition of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font2"> and of all books for that matter, is specially prepared for the brethren, and not for distribution. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">These </span><span class="font2">copies taken by the brethren in tbeir own company should not be reported hy the service committee in their monthly report to the Society. The monthly reports should show only campaign literature placed in the hands of the people other </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">than brethren in the local companies.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The 1933 Year Book</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Everyone should read it. This yea r's i'crrr </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Book</span><span class="font2"> we know every one of the anointed will find </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to be a </span><span class="font2">great encouragement and stimulus to them to curry on in this most glorious work of being a witness for Jehovah. It can truly be said that the past year has been the most blessed year and the Lord has prospered his people. Brother Rutherford's annual report of the work done iu foreign lands and in this country by all of Jehovah’s witnesses will be of the greatest interest to everyone. After reading the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Pook</span><span class="font2"> one can readily see that Jehovah is using the Society, and it is added proof that the Lord’s people are a part of his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not only will the report made of the activity throughout all the earth be of interest to you, but a daily need will be supplied in that texts and comments are also Included in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book.</span><span class="font2"> The year’s text also is discussed, and it will be </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">interest to all to read it. The food the Lord provides his people daily’ through the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font2"> has helped and will help Ihe Lord's people to press on in this witness against the Devil’s organization. Tlse 1933 Year </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Book</span><span class="font2"> is now ready and orders can be filled. They are offered at 50c a copy because of the limited edition, Orders should be placed with the Society’ through the director in places where there are companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord Has Blessed This Divisional Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the brethren throughout Ilie country do not seem to realize the importance of the divisional organization campaigns now being put on: many think they are similar to service conventions which we have had during the past three or </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">four </span><span class="font2">years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We wish to emphasize that these are entirely different and involve instructions and information regarding the field service that it is absolutely essential for allot Jehovah’s witnesses to be familiar with at this . l ime. Therefore, not only should every effort be put forth by tlie service committees of the different companies, but the sharpshooters and each and every’ one in the companies and associated with the sharpshooters should also endeavor to be there. These assemblies have been arranged for In relatively small areas so as to keep the expense incurred in attending them as low as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord has manifested his approval and blessing in a very remarkable way ou the campaigns already put ou, and therefore we strongly urge that all avail themselves of the opportunity of attending Ilie campaign assigned to their area if they possibly can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is not, however, to be const rued as meaning that brethren should go outside their own area to all assemblies within </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">200 </span><span class="font2">or 300 miles. This is particularly true of pioneers, who have to make their monthly quota of hours and keep their expenses as low as possible. If the pioneers can come to, and have part in, the campaigns assigned to their particular area, well and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A 25c Contribution Accepted for English Bound Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">All Booklets 5c, or 6 for 25c</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recognizing the large number of requests from pioneers, auxiliaries, company workers and sharpshooters as an indication of the Lord’s direction, the Society is complying therewith and setting a contribution for any one of the jr English bound books at 25e. The workers in general who have expressed themselves feel that more individual bound books can be placed with the people by so doing, and as the real objective of our work is to extend the witness of Jehovah’s purposes as far ns possible, this arrangement is gladly adopted, and goes Into effect December 1, 1932. The foreign-language bound books are Sac, or three for a $1.00 contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The booklets in foreign languages also have been reduced to a contribution of 5c each, or 6 for 25c. The depression has hit the foreign-speaking people harder than any others in this country, and in order to keep the Kingdom message within their reach the Society is making this reduction, trusting that the Lord will make up In some other way the deficit incurred in so doing.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Calendar for 1933</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">As has been the custom, the Society again publishes a calendar for the use of Jehovah's witnesses. This calendar is specially designed for the Lord’s people. All the special testimony periods are designated on the calendar pad, mid the calendar also contains a very special letter from the Society addressed to Jehovah’s witnesses. Tills will be of interest to all because it has to do with the united testimony given during 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The picture which appears on this year's calendar is most appropriate because it brings very forcibly to our altention the position now taken by the Devil’s organization and that of the Lord’s. We believe that everyone who considers this picture carefully will find throughout the year tliat it will be an encouragement to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The calendar is now ready for distribution and is offered to the friends at 25c each, or five of more copies mailed to one address at 20c each. Your order should be placed now, so that you will have them on hand at the first of the year. Where the friends are associated with companies it would be well to order them through the director, as it will save extra postage or express charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Continued from page </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1, column </span><span class="font2">1) everything, it seems, so that his witnesses can place the literature iu the hands of the people. Now Jehovah’s witnesses should do everything they can and put in time In calling on the people of the earth so that they may have an opportunity to hear and read. In giving these 18,000,000 testimonies during the fiscal year 1933, ttiose who know Jehovah will have great pleasure In witnessing for the King and the Kingdom and leaving literature that the people will have it in .</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Time to Dispose of All Old Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Throughout the year the Society continually receives letters asking, “What shall wc do with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The, People’s Friend,</span><span class="font2"> some old </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font2"> some </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">World Distress </span><span class="font2">booklets, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Desirable Government </span><span class="font2">booklets? What shall we do with our old stock?&quot; It was thought well that we have a “spring eleaning”, as some people call it, only that, instead of waiting till spring, we begin January 1, 1933, and continue until January 20. It is hoped that during this time everyone who has old stock on hand will dispose of it. It is hoped that every director and stockkeeper will get off their shelves all the literature that they have on hand, with the exception of the 12 clothbound books aud the 13 new-size booklets written by Brother Rutherford, and that each worker will put forth a very special effort to place this literature with the people. We hope that during these 20 days not only will the company stock be cleaned out, but also that the pioneers aud the auxiliaries and sharpshooters will likewise put forth every effort to dispose of all of the old literature they now have on hand. The Society hopes that after the 20th of January no more letters will come in asking, “What shall we do with this or that publication?&quot; All of it should be disposed of.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">It comes to our attention that during the past few months there have been a great many unnecessary requests on the part of companies, auxiliaries and pioneers to transfer books from one account to another.

<p><span class="font2">&gt;■ of unnecessary time is wasted yeBjse of some witnesses’ enrolling boiloncors and auxiliaries and ortribution.

The new Price Bist will give you a list of the foreign publications. We hope that everyone will make a special effort, beginning with January<sup>7</sup>1 and including the 20th, lo get off the shelves all the old literature and that when the 21st day of January conies the only thing that you will have will be the jrs and the new booklets and the foreign publications it is deemed well to have on hand. So then, really, your &quot;spring housecleaning” begins in midwinter. We hope that all of Jehovah’s witnesses will make a special effort to participate in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now please don’t start writing the office and asking, How are we going to get rid of them? What kind of contribution shall we take? and the thousand and one questions that are bound to come up. You know the kind of “old literature&quot; you have on hand, you know its condition, you also know the conditions in your territory, the degree of destitution among some of the people. Dispose of your old literature where it will do the most good; but dispose of it first, and write about it afterward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">dering a large stock of books, only to drop out after a few months with their stock on hand. This means that accounts must be adjusted, books transferred or reshipped, additional freight charges paid and expenses incurred, If to engage in the Lord’s work is the greatest privilege that anyone can possibly have, which it is, then the work should be given its proper consideration. When one enters the Lord's work as a pioneer or auxiliary one assumes a responsibility before the Lord to do one's utmost in looking after the Kingdom Interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Therefore we ask the witnesses to do as little transferring of books as (Continued from page 1, column 3) or In a hall, auditorium, theater, or, in fact, any convenient place of assembly where those hungering and thirsting for the truth can be invited to come and hear.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Change of Address Slips Not to Be Used by Other Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are repeatedly receiving “Change of Address’’ slips (which have been printed for the special use of pioneers and auxiliaries In notifying us of their personal change in address) from other than those on the active list or from those on the list for the purpose Of changing subscription addresses for persons who are not pioneers or auxiliaries. We ask that you please do not use these slips for such purposes. They should not be given to other brethren, nor sent in for them, but these should be used exclusively by the pioneers and auxiliaries for notifying us of change in their own personal address. When these slips are received from others, it makes it necessary for us to waste a lot of time checking over our entire list to try to locate the person, only to find that the person has not been enrolled. Printed slips should be used only for the purpose for which they have been printed. Your cooperation will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Continued from page 2, column 4) help the deserving pioneers stay in the field.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to this arrangement, whenever a pioneer who has averaged 110 hours monthly In the work during the past year sends in a report card showing that he has put in at least 110 hours for the month, with the monthly statement of his account he will be sent an application slip showing that on the basis of his activities he is entitled to apply for the allowance. These application slips should be signed and returned only when ordering literature and when flie pioneer feels that such assistance is necessary. They contain further information as to the method of .procedure. If you are a pioneer arid do not get an allowance slip with your monthly statement of your account, it will probably be because you are not entitled to it on account of your not having averaged 110 hours monthly in the work for the year previous or because your monthly report card does not show that the required time was put in during the month.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Surely this is just, like the Lord to see that those who are meeting the requirements arc those who receive the blessings. The more the Kingdom interests are appreciated, and the greater the effort put forth to increase these Kingdom interests to the honor of Jehovah’s name, the greater the hook allowance which is provided. This arrangement has been a great encouragement to those who have been faithful in meeting the time requirements, and we feel sure it will be au encouragement to all who put forth their best efforts from now on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">possible. If a pioneer or auxiliary runs short of books before his order arrives from headquarters, and the need of borrowing a few from the local company or another auxiliary or pioneer is felt, then replace the same at once upon the arrival of the shipment. Do not write to us and ask us to transfer the books from one account to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some of the witnesses, prompted by a desire to help the pioneers, have gone out in the work with them and used their books, turning over to them all the contributions received for books placed. While we appreciate the desire to help, It should not be done in this way. Pioneers are granted pioneer rates on their literature, not for the purpose </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">supplying it to others who go out in the work with them, hut. for their own use. Company witnesses should get their stock from their local service organization, not </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">from pioneers or auxiliaries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">A company of Jehovah’s witnesses can go into a rural community, a small town, or even a section of a larger town, work during the forenoon and a good part of the afternoon witnessing to the people from house to house and at the same time advertise the assembly to be held in the late afternoon or evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even in the monthly field campaigns (concerning which instruction is now being given as rapidly ns possible at special assemblies of Jehovah's witnesses announced in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower)</span><span class="font2"> this portable outfit can be set up at the “contact point” and workers while witnessing from house to house give notice to the people of the assembly at the contact point, where tile message can be heard during the afternoon hour chosen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All that need he done when the time comes to start is to plug in on an ordinary electric socket, adjust the amplifier, put on the record, and let it go. One, two or three records may be run for each assembly, according to circumstances. Appropriate announcements will be supplied for introducing each talk. A supply of literature, for distribution among those who desire it, should be on display al. each of these points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries the Society can supply this equipment complete al a cost, not exceeding $150. As the distribution affects the cost, we should be glad to know how many of the friends desire the equipment as soon as available. Transcription records of Brother Rutherford’s talks will bo supplied by the Society free, aS required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We believe that in every territory there are sections where the poor people have no radio sets and where those who do possess sets are unable to keep them up for lack of means to buy tubes or batteries, and such are thus deprived of the opportunity to hear the Kingdom message as broadcast by radio. Let each service director, sharpshooter, pioneer and auxiliary<sup>7</sup> who can afford to do so obtain this portable transcription outfit and make arrangements to expand the witness for the benefit of these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the winter months particularly this can bo done to very good advantage in the South, where unemployed native residents, both white and colored, as well as a great many tourists from the North who have nothing else to do, will be only too glad to attend an assembly of this kind and hear the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This will establish, in addition to unity of faith and unity of action, a unity of presentation throughout the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brother Rutherford’s speeches are prepared in a concise and orderly manner, bringing to the fore in a dear and simple way the salient Kingdom truths now to be brought to the people. The same lectures given in Maine will he given in Florida, California, Australia, Canada, and probably in every Englishspeaking country in the world, in a very short time. This is as it should be. The printed message we present to the people is uniform and up to date; so likewise should be the spoken message. We are undoubtedly in the time when ‘the watchmen shall lift up the voice, and with the voice together shall they<sup>7</sup> sing, for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion'.</span></p>

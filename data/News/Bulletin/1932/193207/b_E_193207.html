<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Many Will Find Such in Establishing Vacation Service Camps</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses are willing servants, eager to seize upon additional privileges of service. They are not yet all engaged in the full-time field service; some still find most of their lime taken up in secular employment because of reasons beyond their control. Many brethren tire planning as to how they may put the time to use in the field service during periods of vacation from their secular work. It is suggested that by establishing vacation camps in desirable locations in company assignments the outlying parts may be conveniently reached with the* testimony. These need not be ornate or expensive, but simple, comfortable affairs suited to the needs of those to be accommodated, in order to reduce the cost, these may be established for the whole summer vacation season, and all the brethren who desire may join in their use during their own particular vacation time. In other words, one camp may be established in each company’s territory where found expedient, and then different brethren take turns spending their vacations there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This same suggestion applies to house ears aud trailers. Some of the companies arc arranging for one of these Io accommodate six or more persons, and to use it to cover their rural sections, the personnel of the group using it changing as found convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus those who are not in the full-time field service may devote the time they have available from secular work io the best possible use in Jehovah’s sendee. If one is unable to be in the full-time service, the next best thing is to make the greatest use of the time they do have. So doing, greater privileges of service will be gained. Indeed, many who enter the field service for “vacation periods’’ may find the way open to remain in the full-time pioneer service and share in the great privileges of service and the joys which I he pioneers have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Summer vacation camps have proved very successful. Territory not readily reachable during other seasons can be witnessed to, the farmers are disposing of their summer vegetables and crops and are able to procure the testimony in printed form, and the fruits, vegetables, milk, cream, berries, chickens, eggs, taken in exchange can be put to n very good use in the camp kitchen. Then, loo, it provides a change of scene for those brethren who have been witnessing mostly in city ierritory, and they may enjoy privileges of witnessing to I he folks in the country while themselves eu-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Home and Factory Closed</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>August </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">22</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> to September 5</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">As has been the custom for many years, the Bethel home and factory will be closed for two weeks. The time fixed is from August 22 to September 5 inclusive. This will give the brethren a relief from the regular routine and will afford them an opportunity to engage in the field work. The last three days of this period have been set aside for the special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindicatian</span><span class="font3"> Testimony Period at which time all the brethren of the family will be offering </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> on contribution of 75c. A report of their activities will appear in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font3"> along with the special report from the companies, pioneers, auxiliaries and sharpshooters for these three days’ work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The family have great joy because of their part in the vindication ot God's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society requests every director, sharpshooter, auxiliary, and pioneer to have his special order blank, which is enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin, </span><span class="font3">filled out and mailed to the Brooklyn office not later than August 1. Between August 1 and 22 all orders received will be filled and shipped. Be sure that you order enough slock to last all your workers for at least a three-month period, and fill In answer to the question on the order blank. 'The exception is pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All mail (ineluding special delivery letters) received after August 22 will be held unopened and unanswered, and they will remain nt the factory unopened until September 6. We hope, therefore, that all the mail we do receive will be weekly report cards and mail that is from strangers who are inquiring about our literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">joying the fresh air and pleasant surroundings which the country affords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let no one misunderstand the real purpose of these camps. They should be established to expedite the giving of the witness, and all activities in connection with these camps should be controlled by that fact. The name “Vacation Service Camps” means that while enjoying an intermission from a stated procedure or employment, such as one’s secular work, service under the standard of the reigning King may he enjoyed. These should be camps for those “pioneering” in the interests of earth’s new and mighty government. Jehovah continually provides for his witnesses, and I hey desire to show the utmost appreciation of the opportunities granted and to render a good account therefor. It is hoped that vacation service camps, or pioneer camps, will enable many of .Teho-vah’s witnesses to have a greater part in singing forth his praises.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>A Wonderful Witness Against the Devil and for Jehovah</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">All the anointed in this country have read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> One. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The IVatehtower</span><span class="font3"> has carried the article on “Gog and Magog”, and you will have received your first article on “Jehu” by the time this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font3">reaches you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brethren throughout, the eastern part of the United States undoubtedly heard Brother Rutherford deliver that epochal chain broadcast June 26, discussing &quot;Gan the American Government Endure?” and appreciate its vital relationship to our future activity. All of these bring home to us the pertinent issue that is facing the Lord’s people now and the absolute necessity of carrying out the Lord’s commands speedily by giving a thorough and effective witness with the literature carrying his revealed judgments against the Devil’s organization, visible and invisible. This is particularly emphasized throughout the book of Ezekiel, where we read repeated expressions such as “son of man, prophesy”. This expression can be construed only as definite instruction to God’s remnant to speedily deliver the message revealed against these different branches of the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The great truths contained in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> books Two and Three may be approximated from the message contained in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font3"> article on “Gog and Magog” and also the first on &quot;Jehu”. These truths are not revealed to us for our personal comfort, enjoyment and peace of mind alone, but mainly, after we have made them our own, that we may be Jehovah’s witnesses to declare his judgments to those against whom he directs them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore, In order that this testimony may be given unitedly and speedily, a special Inaugural campaign is being arranged for September 3, 4 and 5, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Monday being Labor Day, the Lord’s people throughout ihe country will he relieved from secular employment! and have the time to devote to the Kingdom activities. The’ time for compromise is past. This is no time for the anointed to slack their hands. Brother Rutherford called to our attention the vital issue that is facing the people of this country in the near future, and, undoubtedly, when the Devil's crowd obtains control in the particular manner that he suggested in bis speech, the first thing they will endeavor to do will be to stop the Kingdom activity. This, of course, will not disturb the anointed. We know that God's anointed King is pushing the warfare victoriously. However, tlie Scriptures indicate that Jehovah is going to permit the enemy to make a final attack against this organization and that in that attack His remnant will stand out as His witnesses with His approval and will not be cut off from His organization. In order to have and to maintain this enviable position, everyone who is on the Lord’s side now must push the battle to the gate, must push an aggressive campaign according to the Lord's instructions, carrying the Kingdom message to the people. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> books contain an explanation of the Lord’s written judgments against the Devil’s organization. This is what is to be placed in the hands of the people during this campaign: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> One, Two and Three on a 75c contribution. Do not let depression, hard times or any other smoke screen th ut thq Devil has raised np turn you aside from offering tills combination very earnestly to the people. Their protection depends upon seeing the Devil’s organization in all its malignity arraigned against Jehovah and His creatures and in their having some understanding that Jehovah has the provision for the deliverance of the people now if they will avail themselves of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We believe that in making this arrangement for this special campaign we arc only anticipating the desire of the truly anointed on the earth. Wc know that such a course will be pleasing to Jehovah and that the arrangement will have his blessing. Therefore, let everyone enter wiiri enthusiasm into tills </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindica^ tion</span><span class="font3"> inaugural campaign. After September 5 the three </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font3">books will bo placed with the public on contribution of 90c, the same as the other books, or, if they are placed with some one of the other books, the four may be given on a $1.00 contribution. Now is the time to plan your territory and make definite arrangements as to how you are going to devote your holiday period to the glory of Jehovah. Do not wait until the last minute. Let the Lord’s service predominate. Anything else that is liable to come up and Interfere with it, push it aside. Do not let anything that might take place in the Devil’s organization in-limidate you or turn you aside from pushing this campaign to the glory of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Territory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Cooperation by pioneers In regard to witnessing only in territory assigned to them will be appreciated. Sometimes brethren en route to their assigned territory' stop off in a town not assigned to them and work In it. Then when it is assigned to some other pioneers, they find that it has just been covered. This is extremely disappointing, especially when they may have journeyed some distance to their territory.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">The Hay figures here shown for ihe pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters and company workers are well worth a careful study by each one of the Lord’s anointed. A comparison is given witb May of Iasi year in order to make this possible. You will recall that in May of last year we inaugurated the ‘four bound books for $1.00’ with very great success in every branch of tho field activity. The. pioneers, with more workers in the field this year than last, report over 5'2,000 less in bound books for May of this year. The auxiliaries, with more workers, report about 18,000 less ; the sharpshooters, with more on the list, almost 7,000 less; and the company workers, with more workers, over 58,000 less, making a grand total of over 135,000 less for May this year than Inst. It may be argued that the hard times are such that It is impossible io place a larger percentage of bound books. It is true that times arc hard and unemployment and want are prevalent throughout the country. However, we are wondering if 1lie knowledge of these conditions does not affect: the friends to such an extent that they do not offer the bound hooks to the people, but, believing that the people are in such hard circumstances that they cannot afford the bound books, offer tiie booklets instead. This is entirely an improper course. The Lord knows the need of the people. His judgments and also his message of comfort are contained in much greater detail in the bound books and, therefore, they will be of much more help and comfort to Ihe people. We strongly urge that the brethren every where present the bound books. Jj«t the peo</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> is a special order blank at the top of which appears “Vindication, Book 2, and Vindication, Book 3” and also the names of six </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font3"> booklets. This order blank should be used by all the pioneers, auxiliaries, company directors and sharpshooters, and they should order enough of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> 2 and 3 and these new booklets to last their workers for at least a three-month period. Of course tho pioneers will order only their immediate requirements, as they cannot si orc many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All of the English booklets are to be offered to the public on contribution as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One booklet, 10 cents</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two booklets, 15 cents Fou r booklets, 25 cents Ten booklets, 50 cents Please note that henceforth all the English booklets, Including all the present ones that we have had and the new ones, are io be offered at ten on contribution of 50 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Also any other literature that you need during the next three months you should order on this special order blank. ple determine whether they are in position to afford them or not. In tho crisis that is now impending the bound books will be the things that will be preserved and read. The booklets will be much more likely to be destroyed. Each one should take his instructions from the I.ord according to His arrangement, and not permit conditions on the earth to determine how he is going to serve the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1 n the placement of the booklets approximately the same ratio was maintained this year ns in May of last year, the pioneers, auxiliaries and sharpshooters showing a very-decided increase. However, the company<sup>7</sup> workers, iu addition to a drop of 58,000 in the bound books, dropped by over 30,000 booklets, making a total drop for them also of approximately 90,000 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is particularly called to the attention of all the Lord’s people at this time so that they- will not permit the conditions in the world to affect the presentation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication-</span><span class="font3"> with conviction and enthusiasm during the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> campaign, September 3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The number of workers in the field, the time devoted to the service, and the number of testimonies per hour are all very encouraging; and also the number of people receiving the message shows u decided increase over May of last year. However, all they have is about one or two booklets, which deal with the Kingdom message in only<sup>7</sup> a very' limited way. Try to leave the bound books, by all means; but if this cannot be accomplished, then drop to the booklets and present thciu.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">It. would be a very good thing to have a large supply of literature scattered throughout all the country at this time. With the hard times and the oppression upon the people and the talk of a dictatorship in America, no one can tell what the Devil and his crowd might try to do in the stopping of the witness work. Gog is opposed to the remnant, and would do anything to stop the progress of God’s kingdom. Of course, he cannot do anything that Jehovah would not permit; but the Lord advises us to be “wise as serpents, and harmless as doves”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With this iu mind, would not it be a wise move for all the companies, sharpshooters and auxiliaries in the United States to carry a large surplus slock?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The three above-mentioned divisions should order just what they need for three months, and fill in the last line of the enclosed order blank which reads: “We can arrange to store in a dry, clean place ......... cartons of bound books in addition to the above order.” According to the. number of cartons filled in in the blank space, the Society will determine what cloth bound i books to ship to tiie companies, sharpshooters and auxiliaries, and ।</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Pioneer rates and privileges are gran ted by the Society to those brethren devoting full time to the housc-to-houso witness work. This doos not mean that one who devotes ail bin “spare” time may be properly classified as a pioneer. A pioneer is one who has enrolled in the service of Jehovah and is devoting </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> his time to this most important work of giving tho witness. Those who love Jehovah supremely do not feel that when their name has been listed</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">upon the pioneer enrollment their obligation is completed, but rattier that it has just begun. That which determines whether one is a pioneer is the amount of time one devotes to the actual house-to-house witnessing. Time spent at other things is not considered. What does It matter if the time is spent disposing of produce, building a new cow-barn, helping the wife do house-cleaning, or anything else, so long as it is not spent in singing forth Jehovah's praises?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The point, is, those who have the Interests of Jehovah's campaign at heart desire to spend as much of their time in the house-to-house witness as can possibly<sup>7</sup> be arranged for, and they will permit nothing to interfere therewith. The amount of time spent in the field by the average pioneer has become surprisingly low, and iu the past few months the brethren have been putting forth a valiant effort to Increase it. The blessing of Jehovah is upon this effort, and the average is increasing, but there is still room for great improvement. These remarks arc not intended for, nor do they apply to, the many faithful souls who have been in the pioneer service for many years and who are not at all times iu the best of health. They arc and have been doing their utmost, and their work Ims manifestly hud the blessing amt approval </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of Jehovah. </span><span class="font3">Tins is stated for tho benefit of the many newly enrolled pioneers who have not yet learned to make the best and most profitable use of their time. Of course It Is necessary to dispose of produce, patch the roof of the house car or wash the floor of the trailer, but such things may be done during time that is not suitable for house-to-house witnessing. consistent efforts in the field work are the ones who are placing the greatest number of books and booklots. The placements per hour a verage very nearly the same for all parts of the country, and the more hours put in witnessing, the more are the placements of literature.</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">In view of the fact that pioneer rates and privileges are granted to those devoting full time to actual witnessing work (tiie minimum being 25 hours per week), manifestly fair dealing would require that strict adherence to the requirements be had. The strenuous efforts by the pioneers to increase the number of hours spent in bousc-l.o-house witnessing is very much appreciated, but some are still letting their privileges slip. The records show also that those brethren who are putting forth the most this literature will bo charged to them on their accounts. As you use this literature and place it with Ihe people the remittance can he made to the Society for the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers should order as usual, because they cannot curry excess stock with them; whereas the friends that are situated at one place all the time can store bound books to an advantage. In other words, let the Society know on this order blank how large a con sign men l. of hound books you can handle and slore now and we will make the consignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">You </span><span class="font3">will note that these special order blanks state “To be filled on or after August 1” ; so please keep in mind, when you fill out this order blank, that it will not be filled before .August 1, because it is about</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers state that in many instances “no money” is but an excuse and that when the testimony is properly presented and the need for the message is pointed out the hen rer soon finds the means to obtain the literature. Not all have produce or foodstuffs to give as contribution for the literature, but where they really wish it, there is usually some moans of obtaining the printed message. It is suggested by pioneers that there are many other articles, such as handmade quilts, etc., which will prove equally acceptable ns contributions for the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Questions are asked continually as to how a pioneer should count time to be indicated on his individual weekly report, card to the Society. This should be calculated from tiie time of his first call until that of his last for each day, deducting such time as is spent in eating and resting al: noontime. Time spent driving to territory, or to conventions, or at sessions of conventions other than in the field, should </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font3"> he counted. Some brethren report driving sixty to a hundred miles each day. Surely such expensive trips should be avoided, and can be by properly laying out ihe territory in advance, and moving to central locations from which to witness. Loss of time can be avoided by splitting up parties while witnessing in rural a. Time spent waiting outside a farmhouse is wasted. Be assured, dear brethren, that these suggestions are made that your efficiency in Jehovah’s service may be increased and that a greater witness might be given for Jehovah’s kingdom. No criticism is intended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REMEMBER, NO ORDERS WIH, BE FILLED BETWEEN Till'] DATES AUGUST 22 AND SEPTEMBER 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PRINTED TESTIMONIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many brethren use the printed testimony cards to send in to people who cannot come to the door, and they find that the cards soon become soiled. To prevent this, a celluloid envelope about the size of the testimony card may be purchased in almost any stationery store, and since these are transparent the card may be Inserted and the whole thing handed to people to be read without handling the card itself. In this way one testimony card will last a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">that time that these new booklets will be completed, also </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font3">and 3. The special orders we receive before August </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font3">will be held until the stock is on hand for shipping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We ask the brethren to specially </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">keep </span><span class="font3">in mind that during September 3, 4 and 5 the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vmdieatwn</span><span class="font3"> books J., </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font3">and 3 are to be offered on contribution of 75 cents. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">now booklets should not be used during this three-day period, except that when the J iw</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mention</span><span class="font3"> books arc refused you might drop to the booklets. However, do not use the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font3">books and four booklets in a dollar combination.

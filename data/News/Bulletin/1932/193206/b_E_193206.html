<p><span class="font4">In Ephesians 5: 16 the Apostle Paul says “redeeming the time, because the days are evil’’. In the context he calls attention to the fact that some were inclined to be sleepy and drowsy: not awake to their privileges and opportunities. The truly anointed now clearly see that the Kingdom is not </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">coming;</span><span class="font4"> the kingdom is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">here.</span><span class="font4"> Jehovah God has placed his Klug upon hlg throne; all allegiance and devotion belong to hint That means the time of every living creature legally belongs to Jehovah and his Kingdom arrangements. However, we know in the light of existing conditions that until Armageddou cleans out the Devil’s organization completely there are certain hindrances and obstacles which must be overcome in order to devote our faculties entirely to the Kingdom. The apostle's argument implies that as time goes on we would awaken to a clearer appreciation of the necessity for doing this; and isn’t it true among the auointed today that each one appreciates much more forcibly the need of devoting all his faculties to Jehovah than he did a year ago? An understanding of the new name and its significance has had much to do with this; also the honor and responsibility conferred upon his people by Jehovah in permitting them to serve notice on the rulers and the people that the time has come for the vindication of Jehovah’s name and the establishment of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font4">behooves everyone, therefore, who is in the covenant for the Kingdom and anointed by Jehovah to examine himself and ascertain if he is redeeming the time. Are we devoting more time than is necessary to some secular employment or endeavoring to get promotion from some worldly organization? If that is true, we are redeeming the time, but we are redeeming it from the Lord's service and consecrating it tow ard our worldly advantages, and this is not what the apostle means. Are we devoting more of our time and energy to the care and consideration of our home life than is necessary? Are we trying to have a nicer home, nicer lawn, flower beds and other things than anyone else in the neighborhood? If this is true, we are redeeming time, but we are redeeming it in the wrong direction. We are taking it away from the Kingdom and devoting it to something else. We might go on in this examination indefinitely and still not come near to covering all the circumstances that might be af-(Continued on page 4, column 1) j</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">‘When will </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> Book Two be ready, so that I can read it?’ is the inquiry many times coming in to the office.

It is deemed important that Jehovah’s witnesses acquaint themselves with the contents of these books ns soon as possible. They arc now in course of manufacture, and will be ready for distribution about July 15, 1932. To meet the initial and extra cost of the typesetting and the plate-making for these books, the Society will deliver the autographed edition of these two books for one dollar. There will be only a limited number of this edition printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be greatly appreciated if the auxiliaries and company workers will send their orders to the Society through the director. This will save considerably in postage and express charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Leaders to Be Sent on Request to Companies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the 200.000-IIour Testi -mony Period, the Bethel family will enjoy the spending of four full days in the field work. On tiie first Saturday and Sunday and the second Saturday and Sunday, the service leaders of the Bethel family will be able to bo with the companies who request such leaders. These requests should be sent in early and should state clearly whether they are wanted for July 2 and 3 or for July 9 and 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bethel family will be going out 100 percent strong, as usual, in this special Testimony Period, and they hope to put in in these four days an average of nt least auxiliary time, which would be 12 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Change of Time on Radio Stations</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When any change is made in time schedule of the Watchtower programs over any station that will necessitate a change in the time published in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> or the radio folders, the one in charge Of local radio should immediately inform the Radio Department at Brooklyn of this change. When change of lime is only temporary or for only one or two broadcasts the listeners should so indicate on report cards.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Almost Every One Will Have 4 or 5 Days Off Out of the 9 for Field Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Good Time to Work the Country and Farm Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">July 2 marks the beginning of the 200,000-Hour Testimony Period, As the magnitude of this comes home to each one, the question will naturally arise, How can this be accomplished: 200,01KI hours in9days? Some of the friends who are inclined toward figures will say, “Why, that represents 4,545 44-hour weeks, or over 87 years of the ordinary working days without allowing any time for holidays.” That is actually what it would amount to for one man, over 87 years, hut the “servant” does it in 0 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to accomplish this it is going to require careful and prayerful planning by each one, and then real work in carrying into operation the plan determined upon- Each pioneer, auxiliary, company worker and sharpshooter, after having carefully mapped out his course of action, will have to see that everything that might interfere with it is definitely set aside. Most people find it easy enough to plan and figure how things may be done, but the real test comes when carrying the plan into action. However, when this matter is carefully analyzed and figured out it will be found to be much simpler than it may have seemed at first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the information of all concerned, and that all may see how really practicable this plan is, we here make a brief analysis of how this “200,000 hours” may be attained. To he very conservative, we will first estimate 1,600 pioneers, working 5 hours a day, making a total of 45 hours each for the period, or a total of 72,000 hours for all of them. Then from among the auxiliaries, another conservative estimate for next July is 700 auxiliaries, working 20 hours each, or less than 214 hours a day for each one. That will give us 14,000 hours more. From among the company workers we expect 7,440 English and 2,470 foreign, and, in addition to that, 1,490 sharpshooters, making a grand total of 11,400 workers putting in an average of 10 hours a week, or a little better than one hour a day, which will give us 114,000 hours. Adding the 72,000 hours for pioneers, 14,000 for the auxiliaries, and 114,000 for company workers and sharpshooters, we have a grand total of 200,000 hours. VVe hello.ve that this will not be considered an exces-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>in Hours Witnessing</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">sive expectation by anyone. For the pioneers, 5 hours a day is the very minimum they should put in, in order to maintain their standing as such. Many of them are putting in 6 to 8 hours of actual witnessing daily, so that the total for the pioneers should be made without any difficulty, particularly when it is considered that the 1,600 pioneers estimated for July are well under the actual number that participated in the Kingdom testimony period for March. We find a similar comparison reveals the requirements of the auxiliaries to be very coaserva-tive. Only 2^4 hours a day is a very small amount of time, and undoubtedly most of the auxiliaries will attain their quota during the first three days of the campaign, July 2, 3 and 4, when most of them will be free from all secular responsibilities aad have the time to devote to the Kingdom service. The company workers also, with only 10 hours for the entire period, will, in the majority of cases, complete their quota before the evening of July 4. However, this should not mean that when one attains the quota, which has been suggested for (he different classifications he should cease activity from then on, but he should endeavor to increase his Kingdom interests by devoting every available moment to pushing the battle at the gate, that the. name of the T.ord may be exalted in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now, having established the reasonableness of reaching our 200,000 hours, the next question we must consider is, How can we use these 200,000 hours most effectively to the Lord’s glory? In examining this subject we find that the time is in the midsummer and it embraces the chief summer holiday period, when most of the people who can afford to do so will leave the large cities end will be found at the seashore, mountains, golf courses, and back in the old home on the farm. Tiie possible exception to this may be the suburban residents of the larger cities, where the people have, comfortable, separate homes and a certain amount of lawn space. Many of these people will choose the comforts of their homes and the peace of their own surroundings rather than the rush and bustle of the crowds at the various resorts. In view of these conditions, then, where shall we witness during this testimony period? It would be pretty difficult to testify among the 4th of July crowd at tire beaches or the mountain resorts or on the golf links. Therefore the most practical and effective places to work would he in the country, which would include Ihe rural and the small towns and the suburbs of the larger cities (Continued on page 4, column 2)</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Sections of the Country Put In More Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">than Others</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When Will All Sections Average over 5 Hours?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A survey of the activities of the companies and sharpshooters of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the United States, by districts, for the post seven months, reveals some very interesting points which we are going to state here for tire encouragement and guidance of all the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this survey it was found that the best results were obtained in District No. 1, which comprises New England, New York and New Jersey. In this area the friends averaged 2.3 placements an hour. The poorest results were obtained in District No. 3, which averaged only 1.2 placements an hour, or about half as many as those obtained iu District No. 1. District No. 3 comprises the mining area of West Virginia, southeastern Kentucky, aud the states of Ohio and Michigan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When one considers the figures above lie would be inclined to conclude that District No. 1, with the greater encouragement because of better results, would show a larger percentage of time per worker in the service than any other district; but such is not the case. Workers in District No. 1 averaged only 4.1 hours a week, while those iu District No. 3 averaged 4,'J hours a week. District No. 1, with every advantage in the way of encouragement from better results, did not put in as high average time in the field as District No. 7, which comprises the northwestern section Of Wisconsin, all of Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, the northern part of Colorado, and all of Nebraska and Iowa. In this snowbound territory, during the winter, the workers averaged 4.6 hours a week, or half an hour a week more for each worker than that put in in District No. 1. In this comparison, the workers in Districts No. 3 and No. 7, the first having to contend with the unparalleled destitution of the mining regions, and the latter with the intensely' cold winter weather, arc to be highly commended for their zeal and devotion to Jehovah and the Kingdom responsibilities that the Lord places upon his people now, while the friends In District No, 1, with conditions JOO percent more favorable than those in uuy other of the above areas, with the lowest average time per week of any section of the country, have food for very serious thought This is a matter that each individual worker, service committee, service director and regional service director in District No. 1 should seriously consider and try to remedy. There does not seem to be any good reason why the friends in this territory should not average well over five hours a week. In this respect it might be well to notice what would have been accomplished if the workers in District No. 1 had averaged the 4.9 hours a week that: the workers averaged in District No. 3. Under the present conditions the total number of testimonies for District No. 1 was 585,805. tbc total of placements was 222,931, and the total of literature disposed of was 285,964 pieces. Had the additional time been devoted to the work it would have resulted in 700,180 testimonies, 266,465 placements, and 341,762 pieces of literature. This is rather</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">an eloquent testimony of what might have been. Districts No. 2, No, 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 8 clicked along very nicely with District No. 5, which covers the South from Virginia to Louisiana, reaching the peak of 5.1 hours a week. Of course, these brethren hud the favorable weather conditions to help them. However, all things considered, this is a splendid average, and one that the friends throughout the country should endeavor to attain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The general average for placements iu the entire country was 1.6 per hour, and all the above districts, with the exception of No. 8, which comprises the Pacific coast, hovered very closely around the average. The Pacific coast, Iio we ver, was the second lowest in placements average for the entire country, reaching only 1.3 placements an hour. In the East,</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Interesting Points to Consider as to Responsibility The Witness Must Be Given</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In going over the sharpshooter list for the past seven months we find that there are 148 out of 840 that are listed who have not maintained the very low requirement of au average of 2 hours a week. There are certain responsibilities resting upon the Society in thus connection which it might be well to consider here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord places the responsibility upon his visible organization to give the witness at this time. “This gospel of the kingdom must lie preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.” Where sharpshooter brethren are holding territory and not witnessing In it an average of 2 hours a week It cannot be said that that territory is receiving a proper witness. The territory is being held up; other brethren who would and could give a witness in It are not encouraged to work it, because It is assigned to the sharpshooter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another point that comes up in this connection is that In order to maintain a sharpshooter classification it is necessary to have printed elaborate office files and report cards, and brethren appointed to sec that these report cards are received and properly posted. Where the sharpshooter does not put in an average of two hours a week it does not seem that the Society would tie justified in coutinulng to spend the Lord’s money and take the time of tiie Lord’s people in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The third difficulty we run into iu tliis connection Is that sharpshooters on our list have a supply of literature consigned to them by the Society ; an account is opened in their name iu this office. Where the sharpshooter does not average two or more hours a week to the service, the literature is not put out. It is in many cases kept at the different sharpshooter points until it is old and not fit to be distributed. Then the sharpshooter- is ultimately taken off the list for inactivity, the literature is returned to the office, the Society has the expense of paying freight to the point, and paying the return freight, the literature cannot be disposed of after it is received here, and the whole thing results in a loss, and money that might have beeu expended effectively in theproc-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Districts No. 1 and No. 2, comprising New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and District of Columbia, one placement was made for every 2% testimonies. In Districts No. 4, No. 5 and No. 6 one placement was made for every 3 to 3.3 testimonies, and in Districts No. 3 and No. 8, where the friends seem to be met by the greatest obstacles, one placement was made for every 4 testimonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These figures are quoted in order that each one may examine himself and ascertain whether he is maintaining the average in his particular district and, if not, endeavor to find out why; for if all the friends in the territory can come up to the average outlined, there does not seem to be any reason why the Individuals should not, by examining themselves, come up to that particular standard.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">One Here and One There, Sharpshooter Witnesses Doing Well</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">lamation of the Kingdom message is simply paid out to the railways or express companies or some other branch of the Devil’s organization and no witness given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wheu all these points are considered it seems that all will appreciate the fact that, in justice to the Lord’s commandment to his people now, and the responsibility resting upon the Society to see that this witness is given, and the necessity that territory that is not being properly witnessed to be kept open for pioneers and other brethren who can work it, sharpshooters who are not devoting at least two hours a week to the service should be removed from the sharpshooter list. Tills would not mean, however, that such brethren would be prohibited from giving a witness as they were able. The small amount of time that they would devote to the service in their territory would not affect the field one iota. They could continue to devote the same amount of time to the territory, working in their own neighborhood, telling the people about the Kingdom, but the territory, from the standpoint of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brooklyn office, would be considered open for assignment to anyone who wanted territory In that vicinity. The small amount of literature re</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Take Care in Handling Literature</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Remember It’s the Lord’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is heart-breaking sometimes to see the manner in which books are returned to the Society by those who are leaving the Lord’s service or by some company that thinks it is overstocked with certain literature. Mauy of these hooks returned arc packed in almost any kind of weak carton, apparently dumped in carelessly, and then the carton Is just tied shut, with the expectation that the books will arrive in good order. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">They do not!</span><span class="font4"> The Society cannot give credit to auy company, sharpshooter, pioneer or auxiliary for books that are received in bad order because of being improperly packed. If you are returning books which were received with the cover upside down, or pages missing, or something like that (which is rarely the case), then, of course, you will be credited for them; but even then they should be</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Six Books for Three Large Hens or Four Ordinary Hens </span><span class="font4">“Last week it was necessary to make two trips to Montgomery to dispose of the week’s poultry, 675 pounds. About a year ago one of our party listened to other pioneers about taking poultry in exchange for books, so he paid a visit to the local store and procured a tall bushel basket, and the next night a grave had to be dug for every chicken except the top hen. Last week he brought in 270 pounds of liens in a nicely constructed coop on the side of the car,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Experienced pioneers suggest that oftentimes chickens can he disposed of to better advantage by shipping them or taking them to the nearest large city. Also, it is necessary to vary the number of chickens accepted us a contribution for the literature in accordance with the value of chickens in that vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">quired for such work could be purchased outright by such brethren and kept in their homes to dispose of as they had opportunity. Therefore, those sharpshooters ou our list who, by the end of July, are not maintaining an average of at least two hours a week will he removed from the sharpshooter list. Brethren who feel that they have not been as diligent as they might have been, and can with greater effort average up to two hours a week, will have the remainder of June and all of July to demonstrate this before we make a final check-up on our files.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">am! the establishment of the Kingdom is going out throughout the earth in a very thorough and com-| plete way.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">However, this represents only 17 percent of the total number of sharpshooters on our list, and we do not want to create the impression that the majority of the sharpshooters are not complying with the requirements, because they are. These brethren are to be highly commended for their activity in the field, the majority of them being isolated in remote sections of the country far from the larger companies, but even under those circumstances the Lord is using them to lift up a standard for the people so that the testimony of the vindication of Jehovah’s name returned in good condition, because in many cases they can be repaired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No books should ever be returned to the Society unless you first have authority from the Brooklyn office to do </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">so.</span><span class="font4"> All books should be shipped by freight prepaid, and not by express collect or by mail, as is often done. Always remember that it is the Lord’s money that is being used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the future please write about your stock and await instructions before shipping it to us. There may be some one in your vicinity who Is in need of the same books, and by arranging a transfer, shipping charges can be avoided both way's. Please remember, however, that no books should be transferred without first having authority from this office.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">746 Auxiliaries Put in Company Time</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">To Make a Success of Anything, One Must Work How Many Want to Be</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Auxiliaries in Name Only?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the month of April 086 auxiliary witnesses reported as engaging in the house-to-house witness. However, In entering their weekly report cards upon the records, It is found that actually there were only 240 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">real awriliarien,</span><span class="font4"> because 746 of those who had been granted the benefit of auxiliary rates and privileges failed to meet the minimum time requirement of 12 hours spent in house-to-house witnessing each WCCk</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That these 240 faithful auxiliaries are really accomplishing an effective witness, and that their efforts have the approval and blessing of Jehovah, is very manifest from the fact that in time, testimonies, placements and obtalners, they accomplished an average of about two and a half times as much each as did the members of the other group of 740 Itsled auxiliaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">'Die real auxiliaries gave 00,234 testimonies. They placed 4,130 books and 13,G59 booklets, with 12,112 people, in 13,463 hours of witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The auxiliaries who failed to meet the time requirement delivered 74,103 testimonies, placed 5,802 books and 17,646 booklets, with 16,010 persons, in 17,350 hours of witnessing. Notice that the total work of these 746 who claim to be auxiliaries is not very much more than was done by 240 auxiliaries who did spend 12 hours each week in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just consider the opportunity of service which these 746 auxiliaries ; failed to grasp. If they had been on the job the way the other 240 were, the total placement of literature by auxiliaries for April would have been almost twice us great, or 16,959 books and 56,103 booklets. They would have delivered 245,000 testimonies and left literature with 49,694 people, if they had devoted the time to witnessing whieh they had agreed to do!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On an individual basis, the auxiliaries who really performed auxiliary service by devoting 12 or ruore hours each week to the witness placed on an average 17 clothbound Iwioks and 56 booklets each during April. Those making up the group of 740 auxiliaries who fell down on time averaged only 7 elothbonnd hooks and 23 booklets each during April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This fact is a clear refutation of the claim that territory has </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4"> to do with placements. It shows plainly that those brethren who are devoting their time to the work are the ones making greater placements. As a matter of fact, an examination of the tabulation shows that the placements per hour were practically the same for the members of the 746 group and for those of the group of 240 auxiliaries. The difference is that the 240 put in an average of 14 hours per week and the 746 group averaged only 5.8 hours per week. If the 746 had each devoted 14 hours to witnessing, their placements and testimonies would have been proportionate to those of the other 240 auxiliaries, who enjoyed greater results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Auxiliaries are granted special privileges and rates upon the basis of their devoting not less than 12 hours each week to the house-to-jionse witness. The purpose of this</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">arrangement is to encourage the brethren to devote more of their time to the honoring of Jehovah's name, and to aid them in doing so. The Society bears the loss on literature shipped to auxiliaries in order that a wider witness may be given. During 1931 the company workers averaged 5.4 hours per week in the service. If tho auxiliaries do not average more time in the field than do the members oT the companies, are they entitled to special privileges and rates that the company workers do not enjoy? In fairness to the general interests of the Lord's cause, and to the zealous members of the various companies, they are not entitled to such unless they actually meet the requirements of the auxiliary branch of tho Lord’s service. It is not proper for one to receive and enjoy auxiliary privileges if he is not actually performing auxiliary witnessing, nor could such a one expect to have the blessing of the Lord upon Ills work In the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reference to the tabulation of April's figures will show that these 74G listed auxiliaries spent an average of only 5.8 hours per week in the house-to-house witness. Actually, they were doing only what the members of the company organizations throughout the country are doing. From this it will be seen what a great improvement must be made by these brethren if they arc to continue as auxiliary witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is a matter between each enrolled auxiliary and the Lord, because it is Jehovah who has extended to each the privilege of being one of His witnesses enjoying special advantages over their brethren in the work. Apparently some of the brethren who have enrolled as auxiliaries must feel that the mere fact of their being listed and known as auxiliaries, and going out in the field work just occasionally when it suits them, Is sufficient and that they are thus discharging their obligation and responsibility to Jehovah. If there are such, it is hoped they will awaken to their true situation and at once get busy and actually do auxiliary witnessing, so that the results may be to the greater praise and honor of Jehovah’s name. It is not a matter of doing just enough witnessing to &quot;get by” as an auxiliary, but those who have been brought into the temple by the Lord desire to do everything within their power that will widen the extent of the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It Is hoped that every one who is enrolled as an auxiliary witness will closely examine his own record, and see wherein he can do more In the service of Jehovah. Let those who have been faillug to devote sufficient time to the house-to-house witness arrange to spend more time in the field. Each auxiliary should keenly feel the responsibility that he bears as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. It is not alone an obligation to their local service organization, and to the Society, and the people living within their territory assignment, hut it Is to Jehovah God himself. He has entrusted them with the commission of carrying the message to the people concerning the vindication of his name, the destruction of the Devil’s organization and the blessing of the people through the kingdom of heaven. He has, in fact, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">eommandetl</span><span class="font4"> that this witness be given, and all those vvli-i really love film will oliey the command.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Furnish Some of This Information?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A large number of the friends who are entering the pioneer service, as well as many already in the fulltime work, are writing to us for information on house cars and trailers. Some of these wish to buy such a home complete, and many more want to build their owu. It is quite a problem for one who is not familiar with house-car or trailer construction to decide on what to buihl, and how to make it, or where to get the finished product. There arc hundreds of pioneers who have homes on wheels, and information and suggestions from these would greatly aid their brethren. If you will write any information you have on the subject to the pioneer department, we shall be in position to pass such 'lefmile information along to others, and in this way the witness can be advanced. If you have something good and helpful on house cars and trailers and their construction, let us hear from you about it. Pictures are valuable in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The friends want to know how to build house ears on automobile chassis, and also how tomake trailers, and the advantages of the different types; what material to use, and where this can be obtained; also what furniture they should have, and where they can get it. The cost is important ; also, can such outfits be taken into any territory? If you know of any trailers or house cars for sale, or if you have the names and addresses of firms or individuals who build them, furnish the running gear, or other material, or who supply especially suitable furniture, give this information. In passing along such information, of course, we will not recommend that any particular firm be patronized, but will simply supply information, and the friends cau use their own judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Licenses for automobiles and trailers are quite high in some states, and many pioneers find them quite burdensome. Those brethren operating ears and trailers should keep in mind the cost of these licenses during the year, Including it in their budget, and laying aside a little toward It regularly; and thus at the time for obtaining them, the means wall be had to do so. In many states the cost is quite nomi-I nol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Society’s Depots and Instructions on How to Order</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Read Them Carefully</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Enclosed witii tills </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Uullelln</span><span class="font4"> is a copy of the new shipping instructions, which should be carefully read by all the directors, stockkeepers, sharpshooters, auxiliaries and pioneers. If these suggestions are followed out a large amount of money now paid to the post office and express company mid also to the railread can be saved, by carefully ordering and anticipating your needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whenever you can, order 100-pottnd shipments. During the six months from October J, 1931, to March 31, 1932, 37 percent of the freight shipments made by the Society were under 100 pounds, 011 which the ininimum charge Is made by Hie railroad. In olher words, the Society could have shipped 53,743 pounds of literature without any additional cost; or, should wc say it in other words, we paid the railroad companies for carrying two carloads of books and booklets which in reality they never received from us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society receives quite a number of orders for 80, 90, 93, 95 poun ds, anil, of course, we must pay for the 1 CM) pounds whether we ship it or not. But could you not just as easily add to your order 20, 10 or 5 clothbound books or some booklets in order to make it a minimum shipment of 109 pounds? These books could be shipped to yon at no extra cost to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Won't you please read these instructions carefully and try to help save where wc can? Wc know you will, but sometimes our “forgetters’’ work overtime.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Folders</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We notice In the correspondence coining to the office that many of the friends, in the isolated sections particularly, do not understand the proper method of distributing the radio folder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seems that in some sections the friends got the radio folders and distribute them all over the territory periodically, many times leaving the same folder they left formerly. This was not the method of distribution intended by the Society. Each worker should take sufficient radio folders along to leave one in every home called on in the regular house-to-house witnessing work. It was not the idea to devote the time exclusively to radio folder distribution, but to leave them in conjunction with the regular witnessing. In this way it will usually take from four to six months to cover the territory. That would mean leaving folders with the people two or three times a year, whieh is all that is necessary. Therefore, the only time that special distribution of radio folders should he made is when specifically instructed by this office to do so in order to advertise some special hook-np.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The report for the month, of April is a most Interesting one. The Lord's anointed in the United States have put forth a strenuous effort and during this time much praise was sung to the honor and glory of God's name. In all, 1,134,204 testimonies were given to the people of this country. Also, 270,068 hours were spent in the field work, by 7,996 workers. The weekly average number of workers in the field for the month of April is higher than the monthly average for the past seven months. We hope that we shall shortly go over the 8,000 mark of workers weekly, as we need only </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4 </span><span class="font4">more to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the most Interesting things about the report which follows is the amount of work which the pioneer division of the Lord’s army is accomplishing. The 1,566 pioneers who have reported weekly delivered almost half of the total number of testimonies. They put In a little more than half of the total number of hours, and half of the placements</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">(Continued from page 1, column 1) footed in this. What the apostle has In mind is that we should redeem (cut away everything else) every moment that we possibly can and use it in the Kingdom activity, manifesting real faith and devotion to Jehovah. The prophet of the Lord centuries ago said: &quot;Bring ye all the tithes into the store bouse, that there may be meat in mine bouse, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive It.” The way to effectively prove the Lord is by being ohedient to his command, redeeming the time and using it according to his direction. Many friends today are devoting too much time and energy to worldly pursuits that may be wiped out over night. The only abiding thing that exists is the Kingdom. The only one whose approval is worth having is Jehovah God, and if you have his approval you are going to have the approval of every creature who Is in harmony with him. Satan’s organization is crumbling on every band. Let each one, therefore, be obedient to the commandment of the Lord when he says, ‘When yo see the abomination that maketh desolate stand in the holy place, let them that are in Judea [praising Jehovah] flee to the mountains,’ to the great Rock which is the salvation of the anointed.</span></p>

Two-thirds of all the clothbound books were placed because of the activity of the pioneer brethren, and when we look at the number of booklets we find that they are short only a few thousand of placing half of the total number of booklets. The Lord is greatly blessing these brethren in the work, and, as this April report shows, the pioneers, only 1,566 workers, accomplished as much as all the auxiliaries,, company workers and sharpshooters put together. They are devoted to the Lord, all their heart, mind, soul and strength, and the Lord is greatly blessing their efforts because of their continued zeal In the work. However, the pioneers should keep in mind that, even though they did about half of all the witnessing work during April, they averaged only 22 hours a week, or 3.7 hours per day, for the six days. What would it have been if the 1,566 pioneers had averaged the minimum time of 25 hours?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Up to the present time we have reports for seven months of our year’s activities, and we have already reached 9,446,315 testimonies. Literature was placed in the homes of 2,896,279 people. Surely' this is the Lord’s doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Continued from page 1, Column 4) in your assignment The farmers cannot all leave their homes. Somebody must stay there to do the chores and look after the place In general. Consequently you will be able to catch someone in every home there. Likewise the small towns in the farming districts are the homes of retired farmers and elderly people, who do not enjoy rushing around but prefer to remain at home during these periods. Therefore those places constitute the best available territory for this campaign. The majority of companies have territory of this nature a considerable distance from home. It might be well to arrange for three-day camping parties to go ont to these places for July 2-4, to work in the morning and the early afternoon, or whenever they could expect to find the people at home, and then use other parts of the day for relaxation and recreation, In this way a witness Is given to the name and purposes of Jehovah, and at the same time a desirable change and recreation is enjoyed by all participating. Each service committee should have this in mind, look over their territory, see where such camps could be established and what means are available for arranging for one or more parlies, and then immediately get busy in the preparation. Working the suburban districts of the larger towns will, of course, be in the regular organized way. Plans should,</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>840,340 Pieces of Literature Placed</span></h5>
<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>710,638 Obtained Literature</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">It was thought well just to mention a few more interesting points in connection with the International Thanksgiving Testimony Period report. The Lord's people went forward as one army, fighting together in unity with one purpose in mind, and that the vindication of God’s name and word. Never in the history of the church, that we know of, were there so many workers in the field at one time singing the Lord’s praises. In Proverbs the Lord says, ‘‘My son, be wise, and make my heart glad.” Many of those who partook of the Memorial were “wise”, mid they made Jehovah, their God, glad. What a blessed work the remnant are engaged In!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is always interesting aud encouraging to see what literature is actually left In the hands of the people as a result of the effort put forth hy Jehovah’s witnesses. International Thanksgiving Testimony Period resulted In leaving the witness In a more permanent form in tbe way of literature in the homes of 710,638. This would mean that probably at least an additional two million people who did not get to hear the testimony of one of Jehovah’s witnesses during this Period would also have access to the message by having some literature in their homes. When the 2,447,840 testimonies actually given are added to this estimate, almost four and a half million people throughout the world are thus shown to have heard or to have been given access to the Kingdom message because of Thanksgiving Period. Surely this is the Lord’s doing and it is marvelous in the eyes of his people. The total literature placed numters 840,340 pieces, of which 179.660 were books and 660,680 were booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the variety of conditions prevailing, such as thickly and sparsely populated territory and modes of travel, the averages of testimonies per hour vary considerably in the different countries reporting, but the average for all was 6.98. Some countries averaged well over this, not only because of their territory’s being thickly populated, but also due to the fact that they did special work with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font4">booklet. 'The total results therefore however, be made for a definite starting time each day, so that a real, organized witness may be given to these people during that period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Both of these types of territory shonld lie ideal for the bound books. An effort should be made to place the entire set wherever possible. However, If conditions in your territory warrant it and in the judgment of the service committee and the workers the 4 bound books for $1.00 is the best offer, then, of course, concentrate on the dollar combination. However, in rural sections that are worked only once a year and that represent considerable effort and expense in reaching them, the entire 10 bound books should be offered in every case, dropping from there to the 4 for $1.00, a single book, or the booklets, according to the best judgment of the worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each one will have had the opportunity to digest the contents of the recent special Instructions on &quot;Bearing Testimony” and will have i show that the average number of booklets placed per hour was 1.88, . and the average number of books per hour was .51. This makes a to-tai of 2.39 pieces of literature per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be found that the number of bound books per hour is somewhat higher than most of the countries individually average. There is a reason for this. The report for Germany shows that out of the 94,377 bound books placed, which is more than half of the total of bound books placed by all the countries, 68,730 were paper-bound </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font4">books which have been published in Germany to meet Ilie distressing conditions prevailing there. Thus, by deducting Germany’s total, the average for the other countries would be only .36 bound book per hour. Due to the paper-covered </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> in German, the brethren there were able to average .83 book per hour, and 1.10 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another point which must be taken into consideration is the special work with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet carried on by some of the countries during this Period.

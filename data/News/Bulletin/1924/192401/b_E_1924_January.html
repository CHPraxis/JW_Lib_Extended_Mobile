<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark3"></a>GIVING PROOF</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.”—2 Timothy If :5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">E</span><span class="font1"> VERY Christian now in the race for the prize of an office in the kingdom of heaven should learn to appreciate his relationship at the present time to the King and the kingdom. The great King of glory, who shall rule the whole world in righteousness, has committed to each one of his members this side the vail the honorable and important duty of representing his interests on earth. The King, now,present in his temple, is testing the faithfulness and loyalty of each one of his ambassadors, to whom he has committed these respective interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Our Most Important Interests</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">St. Paul, inspired by the holy spirit, had a clear vision of the conditions existing at this period of the church’s development and a keen appreciation of the importance of the time to each member. His admonition to Timothy applies with stronger force to each anointed one now than even to Timothy. He shows that the time would come when many would not endure sound doctrine, but become followers of men who desire to appear great in the eyes of others; that some of these would turn away from, the truth and turn to fables, or foolish things. This means that they once knew the truth; otherwise they could not turn away from it. We see that we are in just such a time now, wiien many who profess to be Christians and some who profess to be in present truth have turned away from the doctrines of the Lord’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Apostle then admonishes each one who would be faithful to “watch in all things.” That would mean that each one is to watch for the things which would tend to destroy the interests of the kingdom and to war against them; that he is to watch the fulfilment of prophecy, that his faith, might be strong; that he is to watch himself, that he continues loyal and faithful; and to watch especially for the interests of the church and that the message of the kingdom be given to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Evangelist Identified by Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We do not understand that the Apostle meant that an ambassador should lie still and watch; but that he meant that while at work each one should look carefully about him and safeguard the interests committed unto him. He says: “Do the work of an evangelist.” This would mean that he must be active and diligent and not be idle, but faithfully performing the duties assigned to him. An evangelist is one who proclaims good news to others. This text would mean, then, that each one of the anointed must diligently work in proclaiming the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unrequited Confidence</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The world is in sore distress. Not one word of good news has any worldly man or worldly system for the people. There is, however, a little company of people on earth, true followers of Christ, who by the grace of the Lord have the message of good news; namely, that the kingdom of heaven is at hand; that the King is here; that the world’s distress is due to the fact that the old order is passing awaythat the King will establish a government of peace and righteousness and bring salvation to mankind; that those who obey him live forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The office of each one of the anointed is that of a minister. The Lord has committed to each one of these holding such office the duty and obligation of telling to others the message of his kingdom and by this means safeguarding the interests of his kingdom. So important did St. Paul regard this office that he said: “Make full proof of your ministry.” To make full proof means to accomplish entirely the purpose of that office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Ministry of the Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Briefly, then, the admonition of* the Apostle means that each one who is now begotten of the holy spirit and is anointed occupies an official position in the Lord’s arrangement; that he must be watchful for the interests committed to him; that he must fully and completely perform the duties of his high office as a minister or ambassador, and that in doing so he must tell the good news concerning the kingdom to the world. Some may do this by word of mouth; while others do it by speaking little and inducing many to read the literature. The latter is the more effective way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are now beginning the year 1924. The indications are that it will be a wonderful year in announcing the new order of things. Never was it so important, then, to heed the admonition of the Apostle as her$ given. To perform faithfully the duties of this high office will bring some afflictions, trials and tribulations.. This is to be-expected. The. Apostle foresaw, and said: “Endure afflic-. tions.” By that we understand that the faithful servant of the Lord would suffer some inconveniences of body and some misrepresentation, some hardship; but these are small matters compared to the far greater and eternal weight of glory that faithfulness to the high office is working out for the one who does it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1924</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is a good time at the beginning of the year for every consecrated child of the Lord to take heed to himself and to take heed to the Apostle’s words here; to ask himself whether he is rendering a good account, making full proof of his ministry; and to look for wider opportunities of service, that he . may make greater proof of his ministerial office. Let each one appreciate the honorable position that he occupies and joyfully do with his might what his hands find to do, at the same time praying to the Lord to open wider the door of opportunity and to increase his capacity to glorify the Lord. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By the grace of the Lord the books and literature are being provided. It remains for each one to perform his duty faithfully and thus to make a full proof of his ministry.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Methods of Work</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Placing literature in the hands of the people leads to two certain ends. It will be an everlasting testimony to the one met. You tell of the kingdom. Your message is in such diametrical contrast to every other message that this of itself plants your call in the minds of the people; for every one has a longing for what you tell them, and each in his own way is groping for it. Since people believe that that with which they are occupying themselves will bring them happiness, one cannot expect them to abandon their interests quickly and accept what you offer. It is certain, however, that your remarks will leave-them thinking along the lines of your message just because of its singular difference from everything else; and this is one of the results which assures success in your work. The other result Is dependent upon the first above mentioned; for when people are sure that your message is worthy of investigation they will purchase the volumes to investigate. Then the message has been placed in concrete form and is certain to be sketched through at present and perhaps fully read later. Literature placed is proof that canvassing has been worth the effort. It is the evidence of the success of your mission.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Recalling on Uninterested</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">As you go forth in the work, appreciating the message to the extent of devoting time to its distribution, you are quite likely to conclude that what you have to say will meet with ready acceptance. Sometimes workers who being entirely occupied with the truth in Studies, reading, and lectures, take for granted that those canvassed are acquainted with the message ; and they make the mistake of approaching them as one would an individual known to be sympathetic with the work. Instead, generally they are total strangers; or the most that could be said is that while they may have tieard of the message, yet their interest is that of a casual observer. Many called on will remember some point mentioned at the previous call, but this has probably been a year of more ago and the matter is indistinct.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Per Cent Sales Per Call</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Expecting good results from your efforts, it is essential that you be alert to the effectiveness of your canvass. The number of sales should be judged by the number of people you have canvassed rather than by the homes called at or by the time you have spent in canvassing. Be as brief as possible. Reduce the canvass to talking points that experience has proven to be the best, thus assuring a greater number of calls.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Lost Lessons</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Continued or regular service always produces the best results; for the lessons of one week’s canvassing can be applied the next week, whereas spasmodic working a day every month or so finds the worker persisting in using the same tactics, as it is easier to rely on what has been attempted before than to change. Hence in improving your ability to place literature a matter of importance is to plan regular service, inasmuch as experience best develops proficiency. With greater proficiency your time in the service will become more productive; with the same amount of time you will be placing literature in more homes because your experience has helped you to profit by the lessons of previous work, while the points requiring adjustment are still fresh Jn mind.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Whye Large Sales are Had</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">This more than “territory” governs sales. There is no territory where people are waiting to spend their money for what may tie brought to their doors. If what is called “good territory” exists anywhere, the worker has to create it by helping people to<sub>j</sub> see that what he offers is what they are looking for.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Singular Distinguishing Feature</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Discovering what way you can present rhe books so that they will be exactly what people are looking for is best done by use of your<sup>1</sup> experience in your work. What Interests people changes constantly, they are governed mainly by the course of events. Singling out the application of our volumes to the people, there must be some way in which the volumes serve as does nothing else. People would hardly agree that they should purchase them for pleasure. Novels more directly serve this object in reading. Few would be interested in the training that the books would afford them; they would rather purchase technical books. Education is hardly a point of sales argument; for improvement such as edu-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">cation is designed to accomplish people seek in the classics. For information on daily events the newspapers serve. But </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font1"> things are happening, in fact the manner in which they are occurring, cannot be satisfactorily explained other than from the Bible view. Here the volumes serve; for every one is directly concerned with what it to become if the world. People’s plans for the future are involved ; their comfort and enjoyment of life are threatened. In making such a direct application to their lives it is well</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ to emphasize that the books disclose the Bible prophecies of the future. If you tell them that ultimately matters will be adjusted, they are likely to be quite content to take your word for it, since you have in your talk demonstrated your thorough knowledge of the Bible. The proper method is to point to the events and their significance without satisfying their curiosity, perhaps adding that happenings of this sort are certain to reach a climax within the next two or three years. Here then assume the position of. their having purchased, using the pronoun “you”; frequently mention some event of recent occurrence; picture to them their perplexity and concern; how they can take one volume from the bookcase and turn to page — and read — . Thus you have made the matter actual to them, and they see the use of the books. You have not been dogmatic; you *have not forced your opinion on them; your call has brought something entirely new to their attention. In short, it has been a welcome exchange of views.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Information to Gain Favorable Action</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Contrast this with a call in which you tell people a good deal about the plan. What you may say is likely to contain a point on which they differ. Your view is correct; they are in error; you proceed to quote Scripture to substantiate your view, and they cannot gainsay you. You have won the argument but they still have the right to refuse to order. They may smart under your convincing talk. Y'ou have antagonized them. You may have settled one point, one problem is over with, so why should they buy the books? They reason that you probably had to read all the books to be enabled to put forth such a succinct argument; and that since you confined yourself to one subject, that is likely the chief subject of the books, and now what need have they for the books? There is a big advantage in supplying just information enough for a decision, in demonstrating the wide scope of the books, their ease of use, the many varied subjects dealt with, and only subjects germane to everyday life.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Understandable Terms</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The kingdom is a new message; it marks an advance step in civilization. As desirable as it will prove itself to be, people generally have not the ability to look forward and appreciate its blessings for them. To represent the kingdom, to work for its adoption, requires a strenuous effort as is demanded of every pioneer, regardless of his field. People of-today are no more receptive than in the days of Jesus and the apostles, and the lives of these early ambassadors are an example of the sort of effort required to announce the kingdom. Because you talk of a new kingdom and people think in terms of the present order of things, the words you use are generally foreign to their thinking, Hence, the words you employ should as far as possible be such as give them the thought quickly. Avoid common slang expressions that , do not do justice to the message you are giving. It will help people to understand what you are telling them if you progress from point to point in their natural, sequence—one point leading to another and each point rounding out the theme of your message, emphasizing and repeating your central and important theme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember that your message will be considered only as important as you make it. Always consider that you must supply them with the message of the kingdom; for they know little about it, and it will command attention only as you make it important to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">UKE 8:1 furnishes us the key to all the preaching that Jesus did, so far as the record goes. His one message was the good tidings; and any of the Lord’s people who have not yet learned that the kingdom of God is the very center and essence of the hope of the church and the hope of the world, have not profitably read and believed the Bible. The Jews, not being ready for the kingdom, were as a nation rejected from becoming Messiah’s associates in that kingdom. But not all Jews were rejected ; hence we read that to as many as received Jesus, to them gave he liberty to become sons of God by the begetting and anointing of the holy spirit, which first came at Pentecost.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Surely This is Good Tidings</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">These sons of God, if faithful, are to be with Jesus by and by heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ their Lord in this heavenly kingdom. Their honor and blessing will be great; for they will be like their Master, and see him as he is, and share his glory. But this will not be all. If they develop this spirit of love, they will thereby be qualified for association with the Master in his great work of blessing mankind, rolling away the curse and uplifting humanity out of sin and death conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Surely this is good tidings, as stated in Scripture! And the same good tidings were heralded by those angels who proclaimed the Masters birth, saying, “Behold, we bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be unto all people!” Thus far it has been good tidings only to God’s servants and handmaidens, the church. But it shall be good tidings to all when all the deaf ears shall be unstopped and when all the blind eyes shall be opened, and when they shall see the glories of Messiah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While Jesus was thus declaring the kingdom, he was not begging his way. We have no suggestion that he ever took up a collection or in any manner solicited</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">money. Many think that this is a suggestion that the followers of Christ should likewise make no appeals for money, but merely use of their own substance and such other moneys as shall voluntarily be given unto them. However, each should decide for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let Me Bury My Father”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some were attracted to Jesus, evidently, with the thought that one so gifted and so well supplied with the necessities of life must be wealthy. One such said to the Lord: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“I </span><span class="font2">will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.” But apparently his ardor was cooled when informed that Jesus had no property, no home of his own, although there were numerous homes to which he was welcome. Foxes have holes of their own, and birds have nests of their own, but the Son of Man had no home that he could call his own. None but the very sincere would likely be attracted to follow a leader under such circumstances. Wealth attracts many; poverty few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another said to Jesus, in substance: ‘Lord, you may count me as one of your disciples; but I have a father, and I feel as though I must stay with him until his death.’ The reply of Jesus shows us the importance he attaches to every service we can render to the heavenly Father’s cause. He answered: “Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Is It Not Time to Awake?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the divine standpoint the whole world is already dead. The sentence of death that passed upon Adam involved all his children. The only ones whom the Scriptures recognize as possessed of any life at the present time are those who become related to the Lifegiver, Jesus. The Master intimates that all such should take a different view of life from others. There are plenty in the world who can attend to the earthly things. There are but few who can attend to the greater and more important work of proclaiming the kingdom and gathering the kingdom class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is the most important work in the world, because it is God’s work, and those who engage in it are co-laborers with God. Be it noticed again that it was the kingdom of God that was worthy of this preaching and this sacrifice. Alas, how strange it is that so little of the preaching of later times is along this line! In other words, the Gospel message that Jesus and his disciples delivered has been lost, forgotten, neglected. Is it not time for all Bible students to awaken to the great privilege of preaching the same message that the Master and his appointed ones at the first advent preached?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Lessons to be Learned</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Another came to Jesus, saying, <sup>f</sup>I will follow you, but I wish first to go and bid farewell to those who are at home. I will spend a little time with. them; and before long I will be with you in the work.’ It was not heartlessness on Jesus’ part that suggested the answer: “No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.” According to these searching words, who then, even amongst the Lord’s consecrated people of today, is fit for the kingdom ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are not to judge others, but each one is to judge himself. And yet, in a general way, are we not confident that many not only are looking back and making special provisions for the social amenities of life, but additionally are plunging into many of the luxuries, pleasures, and frivolities of the world? The question is a searching one. How many of us will the Lord consider fit for the kingdom—fit 'for a place with himself in that glorious Messianic empire, which we trust is nigh—at the door ? There seems to be a principle involved. Those who are not absorbed with interest in the kingdom, desiring its blessings and desiring a share in conferring blessings upon others, would probably not be qualified by the resurrection change to accomplish the work which the Lord has designed shall be done for humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Gospels present special services tvhich were rendered at different times during our Lord’s ministry. Acceptable service, like acceptable praise, must come as a fruitage of love to the Lord. He who loves much will serve much. Salaries cannot purchase such service, nor persecution hinder it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Progress of Work—1924</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Inclement weather has probably hindered the work in many, classes throughout the East. For the encouragement of those who have not been in the service regularly this year, we are pleased to report that the people are in a more receptive attitude for our message than in any previous year. Those who have engaged in the service have placed the literature in a larger number of homes than the same number of workers did last year. We are certain that as each one seeks to retrieve, in a measure, the time lost on account of the weather a blessing will be received in noting the. greater response to the message, and the joy that comes with placing the literature in more homes will be experienced.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>More People Interested</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The workers throughout 1923 were enabled on an average to place literature in about . every 2<sup>x</sup>/2 homes in a day’s calls, granting that the workers called upon 25 people each day. Those who have engaged in the service this year, have placed literature in 314 homes in a day’s calls; and where we consider the work of 1924 in the terms of quantity of books that were placed, we can report that the books sold far exceed that of the same months of 1923. We believe, however, that this is an unfair view; for the efforts of all are not to sell quantities of books but rather to get the literature into a greater number of homes and also to call upon and witness to a greater number of people. In this respect the work is quite in arrears of 1923. In fact, in January, February, March and April of 1923, the workers called on 101,225 more homes than they have called on in 1924, which means that in terms of witnessing for the Truth, bringing the message to the attention of the people, the work thus far has been greatly interfered with by the weather.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Message Pertinent</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Though much was accomplished in the past year in offering the set of eight volumes to the people, still we believe that the conditions in this country and throughout the world call for such a witness as contained in the “Desirable Government” booklet. Hence our work for 1924 is to bear this message of comfort of the “Desirable Government” to the people. Events all over the world have lent significance to the message and it will be accepted more readily, as is evidenced by the homes in which the literature has been placed, in comparison with 1923’s work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Do not Postpone for Broadcaster</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">It is hardly proper to feel that in witnessing this year we are repeating a work that was accomplished last year. Rather the work is extending and increasing in a great measure. Probably one influence that tended to impede the work, was the feeling of some that the Broadcaster and its work is the principal feature of 1924 service and consequently it is well to wait for the Broadcaster to begin its work before taking care of canvassing. Although we hope the Broadcaster will accomplish a great work yet it is probable that a year’s circulation is almost necessary before great results can be expected; and the results that the Broadcaster will produce will be mainly to reach those who did not respond to the short witness given at the door. The Broadcaster should be viewed more as an extra effort to reach what might be considered as the obstinate cases. We hardly feel that work on the part of anyone should be stopped until the Broadcaster can begin. Many' delays have been encountered that were not foreseen; and it appears as though the first issue of the Broadcaster will not be published until about the second or third week of June, which means that in all probability the follow-up work will not begin until the last of August or the first of September. We believe it to be the Lord’s will that the witness be given this year and a more, advanced and up-to-date witness can be accomplished through the Broadcaster if the message contained in the “Desirable Government” booklet is first presented to the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>How can Time be Redeemed?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Our suggestion to the workers as a means of retrieving the witness thus far lost is for each worker to assume the responsibility of encouraging some member of his class to join him in some canvassing during the year. This office mails out in the neighborhood of 15,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins</span><span class="font2"> every month; and the greatest number of workers that ever engaged in the service in any one particular week was during 1922, when approximately 2,800 were in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From this you can judge the proportion of those receiving the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins</span><span class="font2"> who have not engaged in the service; and our suggestion is that, finding who the individuals are, you suggest to them that they accompany you one of the days you go out in the work. The Director will arrange canvassing parties and endeavor in other ways to redeem some of the lost time. We shall have to depend mainly upon the assistance of those who have not been in the work, as all who had engaged in the work regularly have probably taxed themselves to the utmost in order to engage in the service. As a second suggestion we appeal to those who can engage in the service only cnce a month and ask if they cannot adjust their affairs to engage in the service twice each month of the summer.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Convention’s Influence on Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">During the week preceding the Convention, the two weeks of the Convention and two weeks thereafter, there will be another large reduction in the force in the field, which will necessarily reduce the number of homes called upon. Probably some workers can adopt the same plan that we are employing at Bethel, to make up this time. All engaged in the service here are putting forth an extra effort to get their work two weeks ahead. Watch Tower and Golden Ages will be published that far in advance, additional numbers of booklets will be published to make up the amount of literature we shall lose by the actual suspension of work for two weeks. Hence when we return we shall not feel that we have to work overtime to move the accumulation of work, but we can then take care of our work daily. Probably some effort of this sort can be employed by the friends in the field, especially in obtaining the assistance of those who have not engaged in the service for some time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As indication of the difference in the number of workers between the spring months of 1923 and 1924: During 1923 there were 20, 131 out in the work; during 1924, 15,182. One advantage that the field at present has to offer those who have not engaged in the service at all, is the receptive attitude of the people. They will probably be encouraged by the larger number of sales they are capable of making; and we trust that this encouragement will develop them into regular workers. Hence the assistance you can lend is of twofold nature, throughout the coming months: That of assisting other members of the class to employ all of the advantages within their reach to develop spiritually, sharing in the joy of the service and that of extending the witness for the Truth to equal, if not exceed, the homes called upon during 1923. May we have your individual cooperation along the lines suggested herein ?</span></p>

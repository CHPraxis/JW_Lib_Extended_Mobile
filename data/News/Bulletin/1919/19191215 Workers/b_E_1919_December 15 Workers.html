<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Survey of</span><span class="font3"> The work that is to be </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Activities</span><span class="font3"> accomplished through The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Golden Age, we believe, is making very good progress. There is no other magazine that has a record such as The Golden Age, so far as subscriptions and circulation are concerned. The subscription list is now over the 50,000 mark, with approximately 1,200 new subscriptions being received each day. We believe that a subscription to The Golden Age is more effective in the dissemination of the , message of truth in many instances than the placing of a set of books, the latter in the majority of cases being placed on a shelf, seldom, if ever, to be looked into, while The Golden Age, coming regularly every two weeks, is certain to be read more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The statements at the Cedar Point convention as to the large subscription list expected seems to have left the impression that all that would be necessary would be to approach the people and find them waiting to hand out their money. We still anticipate that our hopes as to the list will be fulfilled; but as yet the people in general know very little of it. A worldly organization - -usually introduces a new publication through most extensive advertising, and to place it properly before the people may expend several hundred thousand dollars in newspaper and magazine advertising. Since the Lord has not provided the money to be used in this manner, ,we assume that whatever advertising is undertaken he wishes to be by the sacrifices of his 'saints: namely, their going from door to door announcing the message and introducing The Golden-Age to the people by word of mouth, ,'ofad in time it^tfill be mentioned to their neigh-^efR'apd f^lked^ibout in the community, gradu-• ajtjy-eiiueing a. dei^-nd for The Golden Age. i-- This^iSt-,v^wfc'«^»ti&lt;odjicing the magazine Is • sometimes/t&amp;Mfais; <sup>?</sup>tryiag^ paid not as inviting </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to some of the' trteijdS as ’galng from house to house ' and receiving&quot; subscriptions. ; However, </span><span class="font3">results are being </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">obtained ’and in </span><span class="font3">numerous dnStaiipes^pebpie, not being-ai»le to locate the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">canvasser who left the sample hay# written this </span><span class="font3">office, sending in their subscriptions.

<p><span class="font3">, It is surprising to this office to note the numerous complaints of the public regarding many so called “leading” magazines at present being published. Large weekly magazines that attempt to discuss current events are not as well received as one might conclude from, the size of their subscription list. Furthermore, many of these “leading” magazines have ,a comparatively small circulation notwithstanding they have been in the field far t&amp;hfwenty and thirty years. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our subscription list should eventually mount up into millions, and we believe thht the distribution the samples, as outlined in the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">pi-evious Bulletin, will do much to overcome the obstacles. These obstacles will become fewer as the public becomes acquainted with The Golden Age. This is already beginning to be evident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A brother in Massachusetts writes us:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“The more we think of the Idea of leaving one at a house before trying to get the subscription tlie more it impresses us. Surely the magazine will speak for itself; it is different. I had this experience with a patient to- whom I loaned one. I told him to take it home to read. I had never been able to talk to him along the lines of the truth, because, being a business man, he gave such matters no consideration. Yesterday this same man was in and I asked how he liked Tur. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Golden Age. ‘Do</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> you • know,' he said, ‘I was reading that at four o'clock this morning? I could not sleep, and I thought of it. got up, brought it to bed and read it.’ It must have . made quite an impression on his mind to prompt him to get up and read it. How wonderful is our God !”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Instances of Ibis kind indicate the progress of the campaign. A colporteur working in Indiana writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“This morning as I was waiting in the machine for my partner, a gentleman stepped up and gave me his subscription. J had called there a few days previous and left him a sample copy. However, I had made ten calls before samples arrived and no material results.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When we realize that the Adversary has had his propaganda' abroad for approximately fifty or sixty years in the form of magazines, and that each publication has tried to give the people something satisfying, and hits failed, we can better appreciate why the public is now dubious and exacting. The use of extravagant language has been so much employed to get people to subscribe for further reading matter, which eventually proved to be what they did not' want, that It will take time to overcome these obstacles. Bogus magazine solicitors have repeatedly exploited the people. It is only natural for the public to be cautious when approached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But people want a rational explanation of present affairs, which is evidenced by an excerpt of a letter from Pennsylvania:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Two of the sisters have been colporteuring for the Scenario and one afternoon recently were returning home from work. They with a few other travelers, were waiting at the Station for a traction car, when a traveling man began to talk about the industrial situation, making some pointed remarks about present conditions and that certain ones were crying, ‘Peace, Peace, when there would be no peace.’ Tliis gave the sisters• an opportunity to make some remarks along the lines of the truth. He seemed interested and to their statement that prophecy was being wonderfully fulfilled replied, ‘Yes but it is not very pleasant for us to have to pass through the things they prophesied way back there;’ Upon entering the car one of the sisters gave him a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> which she had taken along to read while going and coming, calling attention to an article along the lines they had been discussing. He looked through the magazine with much interest and finally Said, ‘This is the very thing I have been looking for. Are yon young ladies taking orders for this magazine? Upon being told by the sister that she could take his subscription, he Immediately handed her the subscription price for one year.”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Know Your</span><span class="font3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When canvassing for The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Territory &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Golden Age thoroughly study</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">your territory. Note the various reasons given for not subscribing and what particular item seemed to be of sufficient interest to clinch the subscription. By cooperation in this way with the Director you cun assist Hie work in your community. The workers in one class have cards printed, on which are listed the various reasons why people did not subscribe, a check being made after the proper item each time a subscription is refused. At the end of the day the worker knows just how to improve the canvass for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In one particular town it developed that out of 106 calls. 49 did not subscribe because they were Socialists; 9 because they had too many other magazines; and 23 because they were not interested. When people give as a reason for not subscribing the fact that they have too many magazines, attempt to assist them over their difficulty by showing them how different this one is. They merely conclude that they’ have too many, and never stop to reason just why they do not find anything of interest in the magazines they have. If they were interested they would read. Put the question to them, Why do you not read the magazines you have now-subscribed to? Did you ever stop to determine the reason? I believe it is because the ordinary magazine tells you what you already know, or else tries to force you to accept some things that you know are not true. You would read the magazine if it really gave you some assistance on your present-day problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another objection might be that It seems to have too religious a trend. For example, one colporteur writes us: “An insurance agent, thinking I represented some church teaching, said it was the church teaching that brought the trouble upon the world. He was a believer in Darwinism and became quite excited as he talked about the way the priests and preachers <sub>4</sub>had fooled the people.” This man really was in trouble and needed some assistance, and going to those he thought qualified to aid , him, he received a stone instead of bread.- Can he be blamed for concluding that The'Golden Age is merely another magazine along the same line? Certainly not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The people are realizing now more than ever before that Pastor Russell was a reformer along religious lines. For this reason it is to be expected that they would desire more Information on the subjects about .which he taught. As was stated in the. last Bulletin, we recommend to colporteurs that they make use of this publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In fact, tell them that you are canvassing for Pastor Russell’s Studies In The Scriptures, or that the magazine enlarges and assists those desiring to read and understand Pastor Russell’s books. A colporteur writes us from New York: </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Jinny people ask when I tell them about the magazine, ‘Is it Pastor Russell's teaching? ’ And It is only rarely now that I find people prejudiced. Yesterday 1 found a young man who was interested. He was a Catholic, but did not believe their teachings. He heard of the Studies lx The Scriptures and ordered them, and has been reading and enjoying them very much. Several of the subscriptions I have taken are from Catholics.”</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Trapping the Seed of the Serpent in his lair</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">Along the same line,, the preachers are making capital of the brethren having been in prison, endeavoring to mislead the people and have them • believe that they were placed there because they were guilty. We learn of one incident where, after a sister left the sample copy, the people went to their preacher, who, of course, identified it as ‘Russelllsm’ and prejudiced them with the story about the brethren being in prison. When the sister called again the people told her that they did not care for the magazine. Our thought is that if, when introducing the magazine, the sister had said that it was edited by these men, she would have had the advantage of having told her side of the story first, and forestalled inquiry from the preacher. In this connection, a sister writes us from California: “These last two names refused to subscribe at all until I told them the publishers were the men imprisoned for loyalty to the truth as brought out In The Finished Mystery.” If the truth of the matter were known, the people would see that the reason other ministers were not imprisoned is because they do not teach the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The statement in the canvass about not taking up a collection immediately identifies the canvasser to the majority of people. One colporteur writes us: “Regarding the clause about the collection: I have found it very advantageous. I felt a little doubtful about it at first; but I find that when it is mentioned to the people they are either amused or a look of disgust 1 isses over their faces, whereupon some begin to tell us about the churches cpllectlng ten percent of their income, or other similar things.” A brother writes us from Virginia: “When the truth is given to the people, showing how they have been bamboozled by churchi^nlty regarding money, they certainly appreciate it. One woman remarked that she had given her last penny; that she had previously thought she had to give it or be roasted hereafter.” The clause in the canvass about the collection, to our minds, is a very effective one, and the people should be left under no misapprehension as to your position in this inattei*.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Opposition and Persecution Indicative of Direct Hits</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">One source from which we can gain some knowledge ns to how the battle is progressing is by observing the activities of Babylon. As stated</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">in the Third Volume: “It will probably be in an effort at self preservation on the part of Babylon (Christendom), when she sees her power in polities, priestcraft and superstition waning, that the work of truthspreading will be stopped as detrimental to her system.” Consequently, if we see indications along this line we may know that the spread of the truth is gaining momentum. Wo quote part of a letter received from Ohio:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Presbyterians and other churches have been conducting a regular campaign against us. They have had a Hebrew Bible teacher (?) here for a week, ami the evening before he left he preached against the I. B. S. A., saying that everything we teach is lies ; that there is a place of eternal torment. I then tried to advertise The Golden Age in our home paper, and they refused to take anything from us whatsoever, even turning down the paid advertisement, because it would advertise ‘Kussellism,’ of which they (the Presbyterians) did not approve. However, the opposition Is not keeping us from taking subscriptions, for out of ten calls I nave taken five subscriptions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A sister in Pennsylvania had quite an experience. While she was canvassing for The Golden Age men and women congregated in the street, taunting and jeering her, one woman going in advance of the canvasser and warning the people as to what she was representing, telling them to have nothing to do with it. However, two persons subscribed forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only when an organization is hard pressed will it resort to such tactics, and it is not surprising to us when we see those who pose as being very* ardent Christians and believers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">. in the teachings of the Lord resort to the methods of the Adversary to gain their ends, i even as indicated in the Scriptures. Though this opposition Is very rife in some places, yet we believe that here too there is an advantage in approaching the people and letting them know what you are canvassing for. If you tell thhm that you are canvassing for Pastor Russell’s Studies In The Scbiptukes and they bring up some words of protest, then, knowing wherein they oppose, you can overcome their opposition. These Instances are in localities where the people have not progressed to the point of true Americanism, to think for themselves, but are - letting the clergy element think for them and practically tell them what to do; they are<sup>-</sup>closing their eyes and opening their mouths and swallowing whatever the clergy put therein.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Success Governed By Mental Attitude of the Canvasser Toward The Golden Age</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">Colporteurs in some localities are meeting with excellent success. A brother canvassing in Virginia writes: “I went to work Thursday, took a subscription in the first house, and have averaged one</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">every three houses, fine man Scenario, but did not trust to</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">individual average of subscriptions from people oanvassed has been 81%. Today in our office I secured subscriptions from 100% of those I approached. I took six subscriptions without the need of sample copies of any kind. When we compare it with $5.00 magazines and then mention $1.50 they snap it up. One woman bought before we finished our canvass.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The point is worthy of adoption. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New Republic,</span><span class="font3"> a weekly magazine, somewhat similar to The Golden Age in get-up and appearance, costs $7.00 a year. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Literary Digest</span><span class="font3"> costs $4.00 a year.

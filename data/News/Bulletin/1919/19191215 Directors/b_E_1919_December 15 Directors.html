<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gradually</span><span class="font3"> Our daily record of subscriptions </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Growing</span><span class="font3"> <sup>is ver</sup>-<sup>v</sup> interesting. Tbe average number of subscriptions received per Hay around the first of October was about 500; later this dropped to about 251) a day; but we are glad to report that since the use of the samples the subscriptions are averaging around 1,200 a day. and one day touched the high-water mark of 4,741 subscriptions. No other magazine ever published has a record to compare with The Golden Age. With its start of 1,544 subscriptions in thirty minutes after it was announced, aitd 2,568 subscriptions on the first day, it can he seen that the 100,000 mark will soon be reached. From the quota given in the last Bulletin you have no doubt determined the proportion of that quota that is expected from your particular territory, and art; carefully watching the progress of the work wit., a view </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">attaining the mark set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is regretted that repetition with regard to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">report </span><span class="font3">cardsjs necessary. In our monthly letter, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font3">attempted to emphasize the necessity of Bending these in weekly.. Less than a third of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">classes organized are reporting as requested. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font3">trust that all will kindly have their reports mailed </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">promptly</span><span class="font3"> at tbe end of each week, whether there is anything to report or not. In •rder that an intensified campaign may be ■undertaken, it is absolutely essential that information be had as to the progress of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">work </span><span class="font3">in your territory, so as to l&gt;e able to guide the work in general. Each report card should indicate the date of the week for which </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ft </span><span class="font3">is rendered. Tbe object in asking that the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">•.eport </span><span class="font3">be mailed as early on Sunday as possible was to give this office the time necessary to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">adjust </span><span class="font3">the order for samples, so that shipments to be forwarded during the week will contain </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">required supply of the latest issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Additionally, it seems necessary to again emphasize the necessity of placing workers in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">territory for </span><span class="font3">which they are best fitted naturally. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A worker </span><span class="font3">would have difficulty in approaching </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">someone </span><span class="font3">whom he would be inclined to recognize as Ms superior, whereas he could talk freely and confidently to people of his own station in life. On <sub>x</sub>the part of the one being canvassed, it is necessary that |;he magazine have a proper introduction. &quot;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some friends write us that in their locality they are unable to d9 Very well due to steel strikes. It would be best to canvass other parts of the town before that section In which the steel workers live. However, rather than be idle, we believe it would be well to distribute the- sample copies in these districts, even though you may not receive subscriptions. The Director could arrange to distribute sample copies to such houses where interest is found, as the. issues come out, until they are so situated as to be able to subscribe. It is when the heart is bowed down with grief and sorrow that it can be most responsive to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The change in the method of operation obviously cuts down the number of samples re</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sample Requirements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">quired. We would appreciate it if the Directors would advise us immediately their requirements of samples in harmony with the new outline of procedure, so that the printing order for samples will supply your, needs. The monthly statementwill be forwarded as soon as possible. As yet our books are not altogether in shape. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the workers’ Bulletin the suggestion is made that each one arrange to note the various reasons why people subscribe and why they do not subscribe. Having this information you can study very closely your territory, and thus plan to overcome the obstacles that are in the way of the canvasser. In going over the correspondence of the last month it has been noted that there are principally seven obstacles the friends are meeting with: first, indifference on the part of some; second, opposition to the religious feature; third, cries of the high cost of living; fourth, people say they have too many magazines; fifth, spending-money has been diminished by drives of various organizations: sixth, strikes; and seventh, complaints of being exploited by bogus magazine solicitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One Director, in compiling the reports of his workers, gives these reasons for not subscribing in his territory: Out of 106 calls, 49 were Socialists, 9 compained of having too many magazines, and 23 were not interested. The reason “not interested” seems a little vague, and could be enlarged so as to give some real definite reason for such a condition. Likewise, the solicitor should report the reasons he notes for the -people subscribing, and thus Directors will be able to instruct canvassers generally how to adjust their canvass. This will need particular watching, as conditions vary in different territories. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The subscription rate for England will be 8s. or $1.92. When sending orders to this office, all subscriptions to The Golden Age should be mailed to The Golden Age, 124 Columbia Heights,' Brooklyn, N. Y. All orders for books and other Watch Tower publications should be mailed to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do not especially encourage six months and three months subscriptions. Rather, when canvassing, talk in years and the one you are addressing will think in years and subscribe i’ll years. If you talk in months, of course he will think in months and subscribe in months. . We hardly think many occasions will arise wherein people Will wish to procure single copies of The Golden Age, especially under the new plan of distribution; for they will have had opportunity to read it. However, in such instances single copies should be remitted for at the rate of 7c each, and the worker should have a commission of 3c each.</span></p>

Some plans along this line are under advisement, and eventually we hope to handle such an undertaking, perhaps from this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The placing of The Golden Age on the news stands has been taken up with the syndicate controlling many of the stands throughout the country. However, we believe that for the present this can be better handled by this office through the Directors. In addition to the regular news stands in the .cities, magazines can be</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">News Bureau No. </span><span class="font4">J-3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">supplied to department stores, stationery stores, hotels, etc. The news stands in the stations are controlled by syndicates, and these agencies ordinarily will not handle any publications uh-less authorized to do so by the home office. Our suggestion is that each Director choose a brother of good address to interview the operators ot' the regular news stands, and the sales managers of the department stores, laying before them The Golden Age, telling them of its object and purpose, and also that a commission of 33% will be granted for each copy sold or subscription taken. Orders so received can be sent to this office, and we will arrange to have The Golden Age “forwarded so as to be on the news stand the date of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is customary for publishers to take back from news stands all unsold copies of back issues at the full wholesale price. Your News Bureau is the local agency of The Golden Age, and your Director is its representative. Hence, the Director can arrange with the news stands to have these unsold copies collected at the time each new issue arrives, replacing the old issue with the new one and merely charging for the extra copies to replace the ones sold. You can then arrange to have these back issues distributed in the regular way in your territory. We do not know what results there will be in sales of the magazine through the news stands, but we believe that as an advertising feature it is well worth taking advantage of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In approaching the news dealer, make mention of the present size of the subscription list, and particularly that the first issue was dated October 1, and before one copy was Issued the subscription list amounted to over 10,000 paid subscriptions; also that paid subscriptions are being received at the rate of over 1,200 per day. Do not attempt to evade telling who the publishers are when interviewing, especially if you are asked who is publishing it and what movement is in back of the publication. By answering them plainly we are assured that the magazine will be continued on the stand; whereas, if the publishers’ name is hidden, it is quite likely that ihe preachers, stirring up opposition, will use , this as a good instrument to have the news dealer cancel or take the magazine off his stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Regarding the commission on subscriptions , received by class workers, we have purposely left this to be decided by the classes. If the <sup>1</sup> class, by vote, determines that the commission shall lie turned in to the class treasury, and the treasurer in turn reimburse the worker for his expense in connection with canvassing, such should be the procedure. On the other hand, . they may decide that the commission shall be retained by the worker, and the worker donate to the funds of the treasury as he or she desires,.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the convention, when it was suggested that territory be canvassed and recanvassed, this statement applied particularly to classes where the whole town could be covered in a short time. It was not intended to convey the thought that Directors should attempt to limit workers to a certain amount of territory and have them canvass that territory and then recanvass it to the neglect of the balance of the assignment. As soon as the samples have been distributed and subscriptions solicited, the worker should geu--erally proceed to. territory that has not as yet been covered. After the present assignment of territory has beerf thoroughly canvassed, then the subject- of recanvassing cau be taken up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All communications mailed to this office should contain the name of the town or local News Bureau. In many instances the Director. Assistant Director or Stockkeeper lives in a town other than, that in which the class is located, and It Is difficult for us to determine the class of which he is an officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The object of suggesting a card instead of a slip of paper for the receipt to the subscriber was that the subscriber would be more likely to keep a card, perhaps using it as a book mark, and thus he would permanently have the address of the local class, which he will require at some time If he becomes a reader of The Golden Age. Receipt cards will be furnished in quantities on order from the Directors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When sending in remittances, do not relist the subscriptions that have been sent In during the week. ‘ Merely send in the remittance and indicate the total number of subscriptions that the remittance covers. Lists are superfluous and confusing. We do not know whether they are new lists or whether they merely confirm the subscription blanks already mailed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Delays In entering subscriptions and in attending to correspondence have been due to various errors. In writing, endeavor to avoid the 'following;, omissions which cause extra trouble, so that the handling of your correspondence may be expedited in this office:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In no instances should The Golden Aon or Studies Is The Scriptvbes be sold at reduced prices; in other words, at prices below those listed in the publications of this office. A revised price list appeared in the November 15th Toweb, and sales should be conformed thereto. Uniformity in price should prevail in all of the Society’s publications. We desire that there be no misunderstanding on the part of the public as to the /Society’s work and then, too, other colporteurs will not lie placed in the embarrassing position of explaining why they are asking more for the publications than you did.</span></p>

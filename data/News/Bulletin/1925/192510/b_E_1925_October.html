<p><span class="font6">T</span><span class="font2">HE commission given to the church is to declare the day of vengeance of our God, and to comfort all that mourn. All of the anointed and faithful will joyfully perform this commission. They will tell the people that the long, dark night of oppression that has resulted from Satan’s misrule is ending, and that God will dash to pieces that wicked one’s empire; that the kingdom of righteousness now being established will bring peace and prosperity to the groaning creation and will open the way that leads to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In ancient times cities were walled. The gate was a way of entry into that city. A city represents a government or kingdom; in this instance the kingdom of God. The saints know that the kingdom of God is here. These are the representatives of God on earth to be his witnesses that he is Jehovah. Now the command to them is to “go through the &gt;&nbsp;gates; prepare the way of the people”. This means that by their course of action they must point the people to the kingdom of God that the people may know the way that leads thereunto. It is the anointed class that must cast up the highway. That means that the saints must point out the way of holiness that the people may turn to the King and prepare for his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The stumbling stones of error that have caused the people to stumble must now be gathered out that the people may know the truth. The anointed must do this work, because the command to them is so to do. A standard must be lifted up for the peoples that the peoples may know where they can find a rallying place of security and peace and how they may be guided into the ways everlasting. This is the present work of the anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Elisha did a restoration work. The church, that is the anointed ones now on earth, must do a reconstruction work before they leave the earth. That reconstruction work is to prepare the people for the kingdom now being set up. There must be Restored at least to some of the peoples the great fundamental truths of God’s Word taught by Jesus and the apostles, which key of knowledge was taken away from the peoples by the representatives of the enemy, Satan the Devil. The peoples must be given a knowledge of the truth. Those who have an ear to hear will hear.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">This work is now before the anointed. If you are one of that class you will do that work. None others will do it. The work will be done with gladness of heart. Those who do it will enter into the joy of the Lord and appreciate the prophetic statement that “the joy of the Lord is your strength”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord has provided the message in printed form. All the anointed can have some part in sending this message out to the people. Rejoice and give praise to God, ye anointed and blessed ones, that you are privileged to perform this sacred commission as witnesses on earth for the Most High God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On October 31st, “The Message of Hope” in the form of a tract for free distribution will be given out to the people. Let each one prepare to participate therein who desires to represent the Lord’s cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">November 24th will be a general bookselling day, at which time the actual result^ of the distribution of the Message of Hope may be ascertained.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Special Privileges this Month</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">October holds for the workers many special opportunities in addition to the regular privileges of service that they enjoy daily in the field; and since the month thus offers more work to be done may it not be that the Lord would have each enjoy these opportunities as added blessings, without permitting them to interfere with privileges which the workers already enjoy in the field? A worldwide distribution of the “Message of Hope”, passed at the Indianapolis Convention, is planned for the month. The Society has arranged to print a sufficient quantity to supply every home in the territory assigned to each class. October 31 has been set aside as the date on which this distribution is to begin; but before the tract can be distributed there is much to be done in obtaining your supply; having the territory set aside for your work, and assisting in the preparations necessary to getting the tract distributed in the rural districts. In the Letter of Instructions sent to directors an outline of work to be done, together with instructions as to how to accomplish the work, will properly take care of the details.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Checking the Results</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Since the Message of Hope is one attempting to provide the people with a new outlook, with a view of the future that penetrates the trouble and perplexities of the people, we think it advisable to try to ascertain as nearly as possible the results of the distribution. As nearly as we can gage the ability of the different classes it seems apparent that the distribution can be finished by November 24. Hence November 24 has been set aside as a world-wide witness day for field service. All who have engaged in the distribution will be invited to participate in the follow-up work; and our instruction to the director is that he send workers into as many different localities or to as many different towns as possible in the territory, and report what results the workers find in these localities that they would attribute to the influence of the Message of Hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In your field service work on November 24 we would like you to observe especially the attitude which the people have taken as a result of the reading of the Message of Hope; how many are favorably impressed, and particularly how many of those who place orders for the complete set of Studies ix the Scriptures and the Harp Bible Study, Course do so because of the Message of Hope. We will then advise you, through the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> of the result of the distribution in other territories, and we can then know of the influence of the Message throughout the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Reaching the Rural Districts</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Certain rural sections can be reached only by mail; and in order to facilitate the distribution in these sections we have instructed directors to have sufficient copies of the Message of Hope ready for mailing by the evening of October 29, so as to guarantee the simultaneous distribution throughout the rural sections on October 31. Meanwhile there will be much work to do in addressing the wrappers, stamping, folding and wrapping the Message of Hope for circulation; and though this work will entail a great amount of time our appeal to the workers is to endeavor to assist the director as much as possible without interfering with their regular canvassing from door to door throughout the week. Likely there are others in the class who are not able to engage in the house to house canvassing, but who can find time in their home to assist in this volunteer work. Likewise there may be many of the workers who will have time to do some of this work in their homes on days they could not engage in canvassing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>An Army in Two Divisions</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">We would like to have as many as possible engage in the work of canvassing on October 31, so that there would be two divisions in the field; the first division going from door to door canvassing for the Studies in the Scriptures and leaving a copy of the Message of Hope at every home visited whether they canvass the people or not; and the second division, those who cannot engage in canvassing that day, giving some time to distributing the Message of Hope and thus opening the way for back calls, which brethren could make in the evening. In addition to reporting to directors the quantity of books sold, include on your report the number of the Message of Hope distributed. December 2 is the Wednesday evening for joint testimony and service meeting; and being the first Wednesday after the world-wide service day, November 24, it will provide an excellent opportunity to report the results of your observations of the results of the distribution of the Message of Hope.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>A Constructive Message</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The distribution of this constructive Message impresses us as being far more important than any other distribution that has been attempted in times past. Isaiah prophesied that when the enemy should come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord should raise up a standard for the people. The enemy has flooded the country during the past year with theories attempting to destroy the faith of the people in God’s Word. The wide publicity given to the evolution theory and the over-confidence placed in the findings of scientists seem to us to be this flood that the enemy would bring in; and it is the R°rd who says that He will then come to the people with a standard. The Message of Hope will raise the standard for the people; and since the prophecy says that the enemy would first come in like a flood it is evident that this flood of the enemy will be so directed of the Lord as to arouse greater interest- and more attention to the standard for the people which the spirit of the Lord would raise up for them at this time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>“Ye are My Witnesses’*</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">“Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord,” to the workers throughout the world; and as witnesses we carry not only the Message of Hope, but also a library of reading matter that will enable the people to strengthen and revive the hope that the Message will bring to them during November as providing a new and more promising outlook of the future. Raising a standard for the people, bringing them the message of hope, is to them a new work. It is a work of the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The blessing of the Lord maketh rich,” and we are assured from this statement of Proverbs 10:</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">22</span><span class="font2"> that God has much in store for all of his witnesses in blessings in connection with the work of bringing the Message of Hope to the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Nearing Her Goal</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">“Enclosed find money order for 1,000 handbills ordered for the public meeting held at St. Louis, Mich. About fifteen persons were present at the above meeting. Bro. I. O. Biery of Midland gave the witness. Much interest was shown. I have canvassed thirty-six towns and sold 1,360 books this year so far; so my goal of 2,000 is in sight.” (Letter dated Aug. 10, 1925.)—Sister C. G. Morgan, Colp., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Three in the Warsaw class went out in the service with me Thursday, and we find in these places some hearing ears this year. Last year these same people closed the doors in our faces.”—Sister C. A. Miles, Colp., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ind.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>I. B. S. A. “War Record” Admired</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">“I<sup>-</sup> am nearly through with the work in Albany and expect to go to Harrisburg next. We sold twenty-seven sets here, besides quite a number of Habp Bible Study Courses and other books. One lady said, ‘Yes, I’m interested. Come right in. I watched the I. B. S. A. all through the war, and I think they are wonderfui. They declared their principles so fearlessly, and then stood by them when all the other religious people failed. But the hard thing for me was that I was ill and kept at home, and could do nothing for them when they were being persecuted. But the thought came to me, ‘He tiiat is faithful in that which is least’; and I thought if I am faithful now at home in the little things the Lord may give me larger opportunities of service later.’ She had some of the books but took more. I greatly rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation. I find an increasing joy in His service.”—Sister Mabel Barton, Oolp., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Oregon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Sells Full Sets Readily</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">“Enclosed find report of a few days per week. Often I wish that I could be in the service five hours a day, but my strength </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">will not permit There are a great many </span><span class="font1">scattered homes and much walking. Have made back calls where I sold a Habp</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> or a </span><span class="font1">booklet last year and find good results. In one home I received an order for two complete sets and the address of the lady’s brother, who would be likely to buy one. One Adventist woman bought a set; and when I delivered them, her daughter also wanted one. In another home I also sold two complete </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">sets. </span><span class="font1">Most of the orders for complete sets </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font1">from back calls. Had almost ■ finished canvassing the three small towns assigned by the director when I had to stop work last October and could not go ahead with them until this summer. By the time I finished almost every home will have some of our publications. I can testify with others that the people are anxious to know the outcome of present conditions.”—Sister B. S. Messenger, Hyatts-■ ville, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Md.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Harp'Course in'Schools</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">“Most people think the full set is a wonderful bargain when they find out that there is nothing funny or fanatical about it. It is surely good to see the unbelieving satire disappear from tone and countenance, and reason take its place. One lady said today that she had to buy one of the Harp Bible Study Courses for her children to use in their grade school; that the school children had not been able to get correct answers to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible </span><span class="font1">questions they had to take; and as </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font1">understood it, she was told to get the Harp Course 1 She herself had not read the book, but it was at the schoolhouse. Another woman said that the Sunday School classes at one of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">church</span><span class="font1">es here had split up and part of them </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font1">using something else, as some were dissatisfied with the International Sunday </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">School </span><span class="font1">questions and answers. I </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">could </span><span class="font1">not find </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font1">what they were using Instead. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Have been </span><span class="font1">wedging the Habps and Courses among </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font1">young and old of the Sunday schools, telling them that even the Sunday School teachers were using them (and they were). The outbreak has come in the last </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">week or </span><span class="font1">so, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font1">I have wondered if the Harps have caused the discontent with the Babylonish wisdom or not.”—Sister Nellie Elliott, Oolp., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Indiana.</span></p>

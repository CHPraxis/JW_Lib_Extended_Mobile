<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font4">HE saints are those- who have been purified through the merit of Christ Jesus, begotten and anointed of the holy spirit. All such who are now performing their divinely-given commission are trying to comfort others that mourn by pointing them to the precious promises and provisions of God’s Word, While pursuing their vocation as saints, they will have many trials and will sometimes be in sorrow' and distress. But the more faithfully they perform their duties, the greater will be their joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Only One Message Worthy</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sorrows of the world are ever on the increase and the distress and perplexity is such that men know not where to turn. Many of these earnestly desire to be comforted. If perchance they see a person who is joyful and singing the praises of Jehovah, it is such an unusual thing that their attention may be attracted thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The colporteur or the class worker who goes forth in his labor of love is not singing his own praises; but the high praises of God are in his mouth. He delights to honor, Jehovah and the I.ord Jesus. But how can he best do this? This scripture answers: By having the two-edged sword ■ in his hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sword is a symbol of the message of the kingdom. Hand is a symbol of power. The sword in hand, then, represents the saint as using the power with which he is endowed, find as set forth in God’s Word, to Jehovah’s glory. The sword is sharp in the hearts of those who are op-</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">posed to God’s kingdom. To those who are blinded by the adversary and who are real- ' ly seeking the light, the sword cute away the covering which holds their eyes, that they may see some of the beauties of the divine plan and to that extent have their hearts comforted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Comfort for Perplexed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year 1925 holds many sorrows and much joy. There are many to be comforted, and few who are the comforters. Let each one, then, ask himself: Am I doing my part by bearing the message of consolation represented by the sword to those who desire to be comforted? If you are not, then take the message of the truth, which is sharper than any two-edged sword, and go forth to the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you are engaged in using this blessed instrument, rejoice more in your heart, and again rejoice, because telling forth the message in a joyful manner is your strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will he observed in the context that this honor have all the saints. Would it. then, not necessarily follow that all who are anointed of the Lord but who fail or refuse to wield the sword of the spirit, the message of truth, are missing the greatest of all honors?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">strength in the Lord will increase, as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year, 1924, there were fewer workers in the field than during 1923, but the result was greater. Thus is demonstrated that from him who hath, but who does not Increase, opportunity is taken away; and to those who are faithful, their opportunities are increased. With the beginning of 1925 may every consecrated child of the Lord search his heart earnestly </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">see whether he finds there the desire to enter more fully into the Lord’s service. If he has not the opportunity, pray the Lord to open the way. If the opportunity is open, enter quickly and seize It. In such the Lord has pleasure. He will beautify them with his salvation, and honor them with Increased opportunities of service here, and prepare them for shining forth more brilliantly in the kingdom beyond. It is not the work itself that develops the Christian ; but it is the joyful enthusiasm with which he undertakes it, the real, sincere desire to be a glory to the Lord and to do good unto his fellow creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">METHODS OF WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That you might share with us the encouragement there Is In finding the general feeling among the friends, as well as the general attitude of tlie public toward our work, we are publishing herewith letters from as widely distributed points throughout the country as we have space. To find that there is tills general feeling toward the Truth is encouraging. It means to the workers that they have a more sympathetic element of the people to approach; for wiien people have begun to think to the extent of being thoroughly dissatisfied with the conditions that exist in the churches, it is encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Predicament of People</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But what is before the workers is to meet the people and point them to the Bible. The people in general are dissatisfied with what exists, and not knowing where to turn for a better understanding, make the mistake of thinking that the Bible is to be blamed for the faulty views of Christians. Therefore they are little interested in anything that seems to he of a religious nature. This probably accounts for their not seeking put the meetings throughout the country as we might expect. They have probably concluded that all churches are wrong. It is in this regard that there is a famine In the land. Not knowing where to go to seek food, people become famished and give themselves over to feeding on other things, or at least amusing themselves or absorbing themselves in amusements and pleasures. Surely, tn the heart there is an undertone of reverence and much regard for the Lord and his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Finding the Hungry &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To reach these people directly It is necessary to take the message to their homes. If the message is not taken directly to their homes it is given but general notice, and Is looked upon as just so much of a religious movement. The necessity of taking the message to their homes brings more directly to our attention the vast amount of work before the workers. Since those who are in the field report ^conditions such as the following letters mention, it brings us face to face with the opportunities there are before us this year for activity, opportunities to go forth and feed these people who are hungry, by talking to them directly about matters which you know they are interested in but which they have already despaired of really understanding. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Complete Library Placed</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We believe that the work of the canvassers is the most direct method of reaching the people; for it places in their hands a complete set of Studies in the Scbiptures. In all of our activities, whether the work of the radio or that of public meetings or other means of witnessing, the primary motive is to place the complete set of Studies in the Scbiptubes and Habp Bible Study Course in the homes of the people. The worker, then, by going from door to door, approaches people directly with the frankness of a friend by letting them have what advantage there may be in talking and propounding questions; for people naturally feel more at ease and have greater liberty in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1925, then, should see one of the largest years for witnessing for the Truth, because the opportunity exists; and our privilege then is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">see whether we take advantage of more opportunities than we did in other years. The work in years heretofore has been mainly to go out and Incite interest In the Truth, whereas at present the work is mainly to go out and satisfy the interest that exists. To satisfy this interest would be not only to give the people the Truth -which you might be able to bear to them in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">few minutes’ talk, but to leave in their homes something that they should refer to throughout the remaining days of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">15 Minutes Yearly</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regardless of bow many times the territory has been covered, if we sum up the, time we actually spend, it amounts on the average to about one witness to each individual each year, and' that witness generally confined to from fifteen ' to thirty minutes’ time. Though an impression was made the first call or the second call, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">though probably no sale was obtained at </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the. </span><span class="font4">third call, yet the worker should remember that the people have likely forgotten what </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font4">said to them before; and each time talk </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font4">the viewpoint that what you Have . to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">say is </span><span class="font4">new, because they have not been progressing with the times and watching the fulfilment of prophecy. Therefore It is well tor the workers to keep in mind that each call is a witness </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the Truth, and though it is recanvassing territory yet it is bearing to them a new angle that events have given to you, events which are of Interest to you but which puzzle the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It might be well to point out to the people that you had called before but that you wish now to place; in their hands something that they may usd to satisfy their Interest from time to time as questions arise that puzzle them. We believe that a strenuous effort should be put forth this year to place literature in as many homes as possible, because of the prominence of 1925 In the Bible and the necessity for the people having something that will com; fort them—the Lord's mind and plan, and what he may deem wise to bring forth during this year. 1925 will be a year of large witnessing; and we urge that all take advantage of the conditions in the field and the opportunities that are before us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“While the weather has ranged from 15 to 36 degrees below zero for eight days, I have lost only two days from work; and I wish to say ' that I see quite a difference in the attitude of the people since we put out the Indictments. I overlapped one street, going to four houses that I had canvassed some time before, and took an order at every place. Yet they had refused me when I canvassed them before the Indictments were put out.”</span></p>

Some carry it to their neighbors to read, and discuss the ser-monette and items. I believe that because it is a brief little three-minute paper every word is read.

<p><span class="font4">“A lady told me that there seemed to be a longing in the people’s hearts for something comforting, hut that they did not get what they should at the churches.

<p><span class="font4">“It seems that people are increasingly ready to listen; and they venture the thought that someone will have to take hold of earth’s affairs or something will have to come, the way things are going—-that it cannot go on this way much longer. They seem glad to know that Jesus is here to do just that</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“A Slav-Catholic with a mind of her own told me that a former Catholic priest of this place said that he was tired of fooling the people and pntting their money so ruthlessly gotten into his pocket, and he left the Catholic church and went into,a New York bank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“To those who say they have their Bible and that is enough, I say that the books are not offered to them to take the place of their Bible;, bnt that just as present-day conveniences make it possible to get at different worldly topics of interest, so the books set in an orderly, convenient way the things now due to be understood, so that just as in regard to other things we are enabled to the more quickly get at any feature of the Word which we wish to investigate or study. I get them to admit first that such is the case in other studies, in this day of hurry; and then they are reatfy to see that it is not unreasonable to expect Bible study to be made easier, especially us they know’ that the light is to increase, as the perfect day approaches, and more light means ability to see more plainly, and these conveniences assist. Many people here are suffering for lack of work ; necessities rise in price. Flour has risen in price ninety cents in three months on 48 lb. sacks. Bacon and other things have risen to correspond, and little four-room houses rent from $25 to $40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I owed ten hours’ work on the week before on account of illness. Have made it all up, excepting 45 minutes; so am reporting one day extra on the card, and will finish and report the other next week.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I found that nearly every one asfkcd me right in, and I had a good chance to witness. People have me spotted evidently; for I was one of a few who were out. They said: ‘That woman who goes around canvassing must find it rather cold.’ Looking out at the havoc of the storm and seeing me, they think; ‘Millions Now Living Will Never Die is what she is around telling.’ This helps to keep it In their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Haye been meeting so many Catholica I found one Catholic lady’s gold wedding ring, and took it in to her and gave her the canvass. She asked questions, ahd said that she thought the Truth was beautiful, and acknowledged that the folderol and formalism of Catholicism was bondage. Bnt she did not take a book. Another Catholic lady surprised me by taking one. But it is rather surprising how they will drink the Truth iu and let you speak against their doctrines without a protest; that is, the majority of them will. I tell them that Catholics are getting awake to their God-given rights; that I have Catholic relatives myself, hut that my own father could not tell me that there is hell fire; etc. Thus I try to get them on a confidential sympathetic foundation; and by so doing I find that I can tell them many things in a nice way, and It is certain that they will think.”</span></p>

We fdund only two who were not at home; and out of eight canvasses made we sold two Habps and one DG.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In my own canvassing I have found that one of the strongest selling points is the set of Quiz Cards. I take the whole set with me, and demonstrate with them. I have marked several questions on each card to facilitate locating them; and I usually read quite a few of the questions, interspersing them with remarks appropriate to the individual. Then I explain that these cards, coming each week, emphasize the most important points in the assignments which they have just read. Displaying the whole set of Quiz Cards seems to afford them a better comprehension of the extent of the Course than does a mere verbal description. Many of the class workers have adopted this method and they report increased interest iu their canvass.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“After the first week canvassing </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Broadcaster </span><span class="font4">names, I am glad to report as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The block assigned to me I had canvassed about two years ago. and remembered that most of the people were Catholic and that they did not even give me a hearing. This time even those who did not buy did hear the reason for my call; so I feel that I really announced the kingdom to every one to whom I spoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Our records show that in the block there had been formerly seven sales made; one Combination, three GA subs, four booklets. This .time out of 86 names, 56 were out or had moved. Number of sales made were 26—four sets of 8, 12 Hasp Study Courses, and the rest booklets. Not all of these had received the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Broadcaster, </span><span class="font4">but most of them had. One Catholic lady was very indignant apparently over what she called the ‘roasting’ the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Broadcaster</span><span class="font4"> gave the Catholies. But she stated that she had read every 'copy; and when I offered her the Habp she bought it without any hesitation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TENNESSEE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Went into a store to tell the message to the store merchant, When I entered he seemed so angry that he would not talk to me; but I kept on telling of onr glorious kingdom soou to be established. After I had talked to him for a while, he looked at me so sour and said: • ‘Lady, did you know you can not sell me one of your books?' I told him that I did not come iu to sell him a book. He said: ‘What did you come for?” and I told him to tell him the message. He then said: ‘What did you bring the books for?’ I answered that I brought them so that after I had told him the message if lie wanted to know more about he could get the book and learn more about the message. He said: ‘Well, I will take the three, Habp, World Distress and Desirable Government.’ After I talked with him a while longer, he showed me where I could sell three more; and he said he certainly would read his or he would not spend money for them. I find that the best way for me to canvass is not to say too much hut always to leave the people with a question answered just enough to make them anxious to see me again, so that I can finish answering it for . them the next time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The people are hungering for the Truth, but still some do not want to bear it. One lady to whom I gave the Indictment asked me what to do with it, saying that everything she and her husband got from the I. B. S. A. they burned; and she started to tear the Indictment up. I told her that the responsibility was off from met for I did what was required of me; and that I put all responsibility on her, that it was up to her now, but that if I were she I would look at it first. She was afraid to tear it up then, and took it into the house.. I think that if we only would think what we are doing and how much responsibility we are putting on others, we would go forth with more zeal and love.”</span></p>

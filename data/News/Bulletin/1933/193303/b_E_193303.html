<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Goal Three Million Testimonies in 94 Countries</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Can We Place 1,000,000 Booklets in 9 Days for Greatest Assault Against the Devil’s Organization to the Present Time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Never before lai the history of the church has Jehovah God brought his people to such a state of unity. The remnant Is now preparing to go forth as one army In the greatest assault against the Devil’s organization ever made up to the present time. Jehovah will vindicate his name, and God’s faithful people in the earth are enjoying the privilege of having part in this great anil marvelous work by serving notice on the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Remnant’s Thanksgiving l’e-riod begins April S and continues to the 16th. During this period of time the Memorial Feast will he celebrated with much joy. On Sunday, April 9, after 6 p.m., the anointed will ha ve the pleasure of commemorating their communion with their Lord in drinking the new wine of the Kingdom. This feast they will greatly appreciate after having spent two days or parts of two days in witnessing for the Kingdom, After this supper they will continue to drink the new wine by zealously carrying out their commission of bearing much fruit to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother Rutherford believes that this particular testimony period is of such great importance that he has written a letter addressing it “To Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth”. Uis letter is reprinted in this </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font6"> and every one of the remnant will be filled with joy upon reading his message and noting the importance of this period as set forth therein, Each one who reads it will realize the necessity of going forth in united action without fear of man or devil. Every reader of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The IValiMoicer</span><span class="font6"> who professes to be one of Jehovah's wit</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">nesses is being given the opportunity to read this message and make arrangements for his participation in lids special Remnant's Thanksgiving Period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Has Come!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother Rutherford has just completed a new (j4-page booklet, and it is hoped that during this period of 9 days all of the English-speaking countries and us many as possible of the other countries throughout lire world will have been supplied with them so that all of them will have the privilege of concentrating on the distribution of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> to the people and the rulers. A day and a night shift have been working at the Brooklyn factory to make this possible. Freight shipments are being rushed to England, Australia, South Africa, India, Canada and other English-speaking countries. And why? Because the message it contains is of greatest importance to all. In the first place, it conlains the much demanded lecture, “Can the American Government Endure?” This question Is one of vital importance, not only to the United States, but to every other country upon the earth; for if the American Government, the world's banker, cannot endure, what hope is there for the debtor nations? Only God’s righteous government, his kingdom, can and will endure. The nations of earth arc facing a tremendous crisis. Those who are looking for a remedy should know the only possible one. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> not only gives them this, but will afford them the opportunity of taking their stand either on the Lord's side or on that of the Devil and his organization. It is a marvelous booklet. In addition to this thrilling lecture, it also contains “Jehovah’s witnesses: Why Persecuted?” as well ns a powerful lecture on “Love” wliieh presents the issue so clearly that there is no room for equivocation. Its cover is one that will rejoice the hearts of the anointed, inspire the people with awe, and strike fear into the hearts of the Devil's organization as God’s army moves into triumphant action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">T.et Jehovah’s witnesses push this</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font6">To Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">My beloved Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah discloses to his people that Satan and Iiis agents have formed a conspijiicy against him and against his anointed, the purpose of which is to cut off Jehovah’s people “from being a nation”, Then he makes known his purpose to destroy Satan’s organization and to cover himself with victory and glory that ‘<sup>1</sup> they may know that [he] whoso name alone is Jehovah [is] the Most High over all the earth”. The time for the vindication of his name is at hand. He commands his witnesses to go forward now with full confidence and absolute courage and to deliver his testimony to the rulers and to the people before he executes his judgment upon the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A specific time has been set aside for the united action of all who truly love Jehovah. That time is April 8-1G inclusive and is designated “The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period”. I am sending this message of greetings to all countries of the earth where the consecrated are known to be, and this ineludes ninety-four different countries of the earth. Remember that Jehovah commands his people that love him to have boldness in this day of judgment in declaring his message. Will you join this company of faithful witnesses to his name? The church is now at unity. Let all move out in exact and harmonious action to do this work as God commands it. Be not afraid of man or devil. (Deut. 33:27) Trust in Jehovah and do his work with joy. Let all workers be organized and move orderly and sing the praises of Jehovah. The day of deliverance is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A blank for your report is sent to you. At the end of the testimony period please fill it out carefully and mail immediately to the Society’s office at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">May the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and of our Father, Jehovah God, abide with you richly now and forevermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With much love and best wishes, I remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your brother and servant by His grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">President,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">booklet, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis,</span><span class="font6"> as they have never pushed anything before, for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the crisis</span><span class="font6"> is at hand. Sometime during this year this booklet will be translated ami distributed in more than GO languages, so that all nations, kindreds and tongues will have the opportunity of reading Its important message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brethren not speaking the English language, but who will also engage in this strenuous campaign against the Devil's crowd, will use the very latest booklets that have been released in their language. Combinations of the booklets they have should be offered to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(Continued from paie 1, column 4) Many of the countries that will not have </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> for this period now have Wfco is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Godf</span><span class="font6"> Wfcat is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Truth} </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty.</span><span class="font6"> These, with the other booklets, will be used hy them during the campaign. All of Jehovah's witnesses have the Kwigdowv booklet In their own language, and if their territory has not been covered thoroughly with this booklet it also should be* used by them during this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Remember, this is a booklet campaign and we should try to place literature in the hands of every person. Concentrate on </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis </span><span class="font6">if you have your supply; otherwise use the latest booklets you have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the nine days appointed for tills special witness -we are setting as our goal 3,000,000 testimonies, these to be delivered to the peoples and rulers of the world in at least 94 countries. So far, brethren In 94 countries throughout the world have been sent Brother Rutherford’s letter and have been invited to join in the Memorial Feast and participate in the witness work. We hope that all the brethren will make a report to their branch office, or to the office at Brooklyn if they are not connected with a branch office, stating what has been accomplished because of their activity in the door-to-door witness. Do you believe that during these 9 days, in these 94 countries, 3,000,000 testimonies can be delivered and 4,000,000 booklets placed? If you do believe this, then every one of you will have to work hard and put forth an extraordinary effort to carry this message to the people. If 40,000 workers each place 25 booklets it will total 1,000,000 pieces of literature. Every one of us should be able to do that in 9 days, shouldn’t we?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last year, during the International Thanksgiving Testimony Period, which was from Mnrch 20 to 27, only 38,585 workers engaged in the field service, out of the 81,778 who partook of the Memorial. We wonder how many will partake of the Memorial, and also whether a greater number will engage in ^witnessing for the King and the Kingdom than did last year. All who partake should also witness. This year the period falls a few weeks inter than last year. From April 8 to 16 the weather conditions in the Northern and Southern hemispheres should be similar, and at this season of the year it is a wonderful time to be out in the open singing forth Jehovah’s praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period, April 8 to 16, we believe will be the greatest season of joy and manifested unity of the Lord’s people ever experienced up to this time. Every one should make preparations to have a definite part in this most glorious work. The time for serving notice on the enemy prior to the vindication of Jehovah’s name is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do you remember what the 1933 calendar has to say for the month of April? Anyway, we repeat it here. You will enjoy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ ‘Fully assured of God’s protection and preservation, the remnant now rejoice in gladness and arc feasting and having a good day because of what they see approaching. These are saying one to another; “Let us be glad and rejoice.&quot; To them the approaching fight means the vindication of God’s name and the everlasting joy of those who follow in the right way.’ . . . Make the Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period a service feast.”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Place Orders Nov</span></h4>
<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Be Sure You Have a Good Supply</span></h6>
<p><span class="font6">So that Jehovah’s witnesses maybe supplied witfi ammunition for The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period, April 8-16, a consignment of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> will be shipped with orders received by us between February 20 and Marcli 15 and added to the invoices. tf </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> is included in the order received before March 15, the order will have preference over the consignment and the consignment, will not be shipped. In certain instances, however, it may be deemed advisable to reduce or increase the amount of the order to fit the particular case. To those from whom we haw not received orders by Marcli 15, the consignment of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Name of JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is a Strong Tower</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font7"> Time </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of The Crisis</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time has come to call upon all those to whom the name of Jehovah is a strong tower to pul forth another great effort, in fact the greatest effort ever. To flee into this strong tower indicates that, they will make haste to respond. The special call to act®n comes for The Remnant's Thanksgiving Period, April 8-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What arrangements should be made? First; During this period every witness should endeavor to place </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> iu the hands of as many people as possible, whether such a witness be a company worker, sharpshooter, pioneer or auxiliary. To do this an adequate supply of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> should be on hand. (Read the article on consignments and ordering, in tills Bulletin.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Second: Thickly populated territory should be set aside for this particular period. I'Ians should be made for covering the territory thoroughly and quickly. Pioneers should do this as well as companies. If they have covered their city territory with the oilier literature and have only riimis left, then go over the city territory with the booklet. Pioneers as well as all other workers will be confining their efforts to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> for this period. If they have been saving their city territory, a preliminary witness with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis </span><span class="font6">will be just the thing for an immediate follow-up with the rest of the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Third: To reach more people with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> will mean more time than ever must be devoted to the field work. Directors should arrange for parties io go out into the work for every day of the campaign. Don’t be content, if you are a company worker, with two or three days of a. few hours each in the service. If you can’t get out during the daytime, plan to get out an hour or so each evening. In fact, seize every possible moment for notifying the people that “The Crisis” is here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pioneers, do you know that your best average for a service period was during 150,000-Hour Week, in July, 1930, at which time you reported nil average of 45-80 hours each? Cun you boost this to 50 hours? During the same period the auxiliaries reported an average of 24.82 hours each. What, do you say about making tins an average of 28 hours? Company workers and sharpshooters, you made your best average during Witness Week, September, 1931, at which time you averaged 9.9 hours each. Can you increase this to .12 hours each?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has placed tills message in the hands of the remnant. Uis work must be done speedily.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>for “The Crisis”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font6"> will be shipped, so that all may be supplied with this booklet by April 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of the companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries have allowed their accounts to get In poor condition because of not sending in remittances for the literature distributed. These should be sure to get in their orders for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> before March 15, accompanied by a remittance to cover, so (hat they can be adequately supplied for this special period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By ordering </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> together with whatever other literature maybe needed in the near future, shipping expense can be saved. For this reason we request that you get in your orders before March 15 if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The consignments to companies and sharpshooters are to be based on what is considered to be adequate for the special service period and a few weeks following. In most instances pioneers are to be consigned 360 and auxiliaries 100 (except where working in parties, when n carton of 460 will be consigned to each two pioneers and 360 to each two auxiliaries). Exceptions will be made to this rule when deemed advisable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">REMEMBER, THESE BOOKLETS ARE NOT TO BE PLACED WITH THE PEOPLE BEFORE THE REMNANT’S THANKSGIVING PERIOD, APRIL 8-10, PREPARE NOW FOR THIS GREAT ATTACK.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The importance of The Remnant's Thanksgiving Period, and the necessity of eliminating everything that might in any w-ay interfere with it, is further emphasized by the fact that Brother Rutherford has instructed us to cancel all divisional campaigns for April 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This, therefore, is to advise all divisional leaders and all field workers that the campaigns scheduled for that date are hereby canceled, and that, instead, you use the time for regular service in your own territory and for making arrangements for The Remnant’s Testimony Period. Everything that can be taken care of In advance, so as to allow more time for field service during this special period, should be taken care of during the week preceding it. Let our slogan be; Everyone iu the service at least some part of each day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Lord is richly blessing the progress of the work of manufacturing the portable transcription machines, mid (hey are now being assembled ami shipped. We hope to have 11 considerable number of them in use within a short while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These machines will afford another splendid opportunity to give public witness to the Kingdom message in the territory. Pioneers who have a machine, as well ;t<sub>S</sub> others, are advised to arrange for schoolhouses, empty churches, or other free buildings, to which the public may be invited, and to put on a program of one or two transcription records and then present the books to the people. There are many who are becoming too poor to afford radio sets, and this will afford a way for them to hear the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under no circumstances are transcription records supplied for radio broadcasting to be used on the portable transcription machines. This is very important. Use on the portable transcription machines only such records as have been supplied yon for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Care should he taken that only needles specially prepared for ‘33-1/3 revolutions per minute’ records are used. Use a new’ needle for each running. Should records become cracked or scratched so that the presentation is to any degree distorted, advise this office, with a full description of the damage. The clarity and effectiveness of the presentation of the Kingdom message by tin's means depends upon the full cooperation of each one. Therefore we request that those who own and use the portable transcription machines give careful consideration to the above.</span></p>

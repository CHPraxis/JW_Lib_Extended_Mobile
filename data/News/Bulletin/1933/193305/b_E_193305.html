<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Name of JEHOVAH Is a Strong Tower</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">To </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Those Who Love Him Supremely</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jeiiovali preserves and blesses those who love him. The love of the creature </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font3">the Creator is shown by keeping his commandments. God’s Word makes it plainly to appear Iha I. lie will not permit one to become a member of his house and abide there unless that one proves his love for Jehovah. Only such eonld have a part in the vindication of Jehovah's name. This </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">point can</span><span class="font3">not be overstated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Love is an unselfish devotion to the I-o rd. Real love is expressed in works, and not in words only. The truly anointed, having a vision of their kingdom privileges and a burning desire to serve the Lord, are anxious to consider ways and means for practically demonstrating their love for Jehovah and his kingdom by their works. The following are a few suggestions for the aid of such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Summer is near, bringing to n great majority of the anointed who are unable to devote all their time to the Lord’s kingdom service, periods of from two weeks to a month or more of vacation. What is to be done with this time? Why not use it in the Kingdom service? That is a manifestation of love. Inquire of your local director what territory he has available and commence making your plans now for devoting all the additional time you possibly can to the service this year, so that when vacation time comes around you will be all set to start in. If your local service director hasn’t enough territory, have him write the Society regarding more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the duty and responsibility of service directors everywhere to cooperate whole-heartedly with all who want to devote additional time to the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dayliifht Saving Time</span><span class="font3"> begins April 30. What arc you going to do with your evenings? The Lord says, “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” If the Kingdom is our life and our treasure, then these long evenings are going to afford a splendid opportunity to demonstrate this to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And again, there are those who are working 30 hours a week<sup>-</sup>, 5 days of 6 hours each. This allows those brethren affected by these conditions more than enough time to qualify for the auxiliary service. Almost, all the brethren have Saturday afternoon off, and each director should arrange for field work for those who can participate at this time, as well as every Sunday. The more hours in the witness work, the more people will learn of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Keep in step with the advancing march of the Lord's army by taking advantage of every possible opportunity or opening provided to devote more time to the service that the name of the Lord may be exalted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These are only a few suggestions. Undoubtedly local conditions will open up to everyone many additional opportunities that can be used to advantage to increase their Kingdom interests. Tho Lord is our strength and our song in this day, and his name is the strong tower to. those who love him supremely. The issue is laid down by the Lord in Ihese words: “The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription Machines </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Splendid Way to Aid the People</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The electrical :md spring-wound machines which the Society had manufactured especially for the broadcast of Brother Rutherford’s transcription lectures have proved very successful. The brethren who have received their machines throughout tho country are very much pleased and are arranging public meetings along the lines suggested in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The- 'Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the </span><span class="font3">special letter sent out as to how a meeting should be conducted. Many people fire too poor now to keep themselves equipped with tubes and to keep their radios in repair. Tho Jonadab class are anxious to learn the way of escape and take their stand on the Lord’s side, and it is the privilege of the remnant to bring to them this all-important message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We wish to announce again that the electrical machine can be obtained for $140, and the spring-■wound for $120. Both types of machine are supplied with an extra set of tubes, which are packed underneath the turntable. A few inquiries have come to the office in regard to the spring-wound machine and its equipment. Concerning this machine we wish to state that, it is equipped with Eveready type No. 7111 13-volt cell batteries and also Eveready type No. 486 45-volt. These batteries may be secured at any place where batteries are obtainable. Most radio dealers and hardware supply stores carry them. They may also be obtained direct from Cleveland, if anyone so desires, and the brethren purchasing I hem will be given the benefit of any reduced cost. The approximate life of the tubes in this set is 1000 hours of use. The approximate battery life of the fd ament supply battery (Eveready type No. 7111 Ij-volt cells), screw terminal, should be about 200 hours. The approximate life of the plate supply batteries (Eveready type No. 486 45-volt) should be between 400 and 500 hours.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses Put in 219,228 More Hours</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tho first six-inonth period of the fiscal year 1'033 came to a close with the activities of March. You are curious to know how the work thus far compares with that of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1932. </span><span class="font3">Times have been exceedingly strenuous, and the prevailing opinion is that the work has therefore decreased. It has been extremely difficult to plane literallire, because the people have been filled with fear. The Devil and his organization have succeeded in turning many against Jehovah, and opposition to the Kingdom message has increased ; </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">but</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wanders upon wonders!</span><span class="font3"> the figures show more literature placed with the people, more testimonies delivered, and more hours devoted to the service by Jehovah’s witnesses than during the same period last yea r.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>‘Whosoever Will, Let Him Partake’</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">This is the time, of course, when Jchovnh’s anointed, his witnesses, arc going to take the lead In pressing the battie to the gate and lifting up a.standard for the people. However, the Bible clearly states that not only are tlie spirit and the bride to say, Come, but he that heareth is to say, Come, and he that is athirst may come, and whosoever will, let him partake of the water of life freely. These scriptures indicate that, in addiiion .to the anointed, a great many whom we now refer to ;is the &quot;JehonaiJab class&quot; are going to hear, drink, and be instrumental in carrying some knowledge of the Kingdom message to others. These should be encouraged to do this. It is the privilege of the anointed not only to encourage but to instruct</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Divisional Campaigns</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>All Workers to Have These Points in Mind</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">in order that ail may be familiar with tlie details and requirements of the divisional campaigns, we are presenting a brief summary of this work in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bulletin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the instructions to divisional leaders the following statement is made: &quot;Each division is to work its own assigned area and Is not to go outside of that territory without definite instructions from the Brooklyn office, Flense do not w’rite to other divisions requesting them to come to your territory. If you believe that in your area there arc cities where you encounter opposition that are too large to be effectively worked without additional help, write the Brooklyn office explaining the situation and yon will be instructed.” We ask divisional leaders and all the brethren in (he division to please comply with this requirement and avoid confusion. Divisions are to put on special campaigns only when they receive instructions from the Brooklyn office. Therefore, company directors, sharpshooters, pioneers or auxiliaries should not request campaign divisional lenders for assistance when they encounter difficulty in their territory, hut they should write to the Brooklyn office explaining the entire situation, and the necessary arrangements will be made from here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Where an emergency arises that requires several divisions to concentrate on one town, no one shall be asked to travel more than 200 miles from one division to another. This will be the outside limit between division points. This, of course, wilt not preclude anyone from going who desires to, but when the brethren travel long distances it is depicting Io their strength and minimizes their ability- to perform the duties that they have to perform,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren attending divisional campaigns should, as far as possible, take their own literature, radio folders and calling cards and thus avoid the necessity of trying to get additional literature at the city where the campaign is being put ou.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In reporting divisional activity a report is to be made to the divisional leader as outlined in the car drivers’ instructions. However, this is simply a divisional report, and the service director of the company where the divisional campaign is held should report to Brooklyn on them in doing this effectively to the praise of Jehovah’s name at this time. Whether these be young or old, anyone who wishes to haem part in declaring the purposes of Jehovah should be helped and instructed. No one should take himself so seriously al this time as to think that he should in any wise try to discourage or hinder anyone else from serving Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From tiie number of reports received in this office covering the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font3"> campaign, it is evident that there arc a great many people of good will throughout the country who want to have some part in carrying this message to olliers. In the majority of cases these have been encouraged and helped by the brethren. Some of the brethren, not seeing the issue clearly, try to discourage these people from doing this work. This is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">his monthly report only tlie work done, by the workers in his company. The workers from each company, and sharpshooters, should report to their own service director the amount of time worked, testimonies given, placements made and literature distributed, and each service director should include tins report in his monthly report to the Society. Tims participation in divisional campaigns should not reduce the activity of the individual company, for they get credit for the work done by their workers regardless of where that work is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Continued from page 1, column 4) of 2,786,536. This means that 138,492 fewer bound books were placed, or 681,959 as compared with 820,451. It seems quite remarkable that there should have been such a big increase in tlie number of booklets distributed, in view of the special work last fiscal year with 11'ic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet during the months of October anti November; especially so when this work resulted in 846,988 more placements being made during those two months than during the same tw-o months this fiscal year. This big lead in placements, during the last four months, has been cut down to 691,164, and, with tlie special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis </span><span class="font3">campaign, we anticipate it will he overcome completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">8,471,339 testimonies, or 47 percent of the year’s quota of 18,000,000, have already been delivered, during tlie most dlfficnlt six months of the year so far as weather conditions are concerned. With the succinct testimony for tlie </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font3"> booklet, and the best months ahead, we can with confidence look forward to not only making the quota, but possibly surpassing it, by tlie Lord's grace. Last year it was possible to make 50 percent of the year’s total testimonies during the first six iriontlis, in 45 percent of the year’s total hours reported, because of the special work with tlie </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font3">booklet. Tliis year, without a singlebooklet campaign, last year's figure lias been surpassed. What will tlie total of testimonies be at the end of the next six months? In hours, 45.7 percent of the year’s quota of 4,431,-(X10 have been reported so far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By steady work, taking advantage of every opportunity of making known (he Kingdom gospel and pressing on in the work in spite of Ihe opposition of the enemy, we can wil.Ii confidence look to the Lord’s blessing upon tlie efforts put forth to the honor of his name.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Try to Leave It in Every Home</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">Tlie message contained in the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The. Crisis</span><span class="font3"> is one which should be placed in every home, if possible. The very fact that the Lord enabled arrangements to lie made for so many different countries to have it really for distribution during The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period is proof of its importance. Willie the campaign with the one booklet alone has come to an end with the conclusion of this period, eaeh one of Jehovah’s witnesses should endeavor to leave a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis </span><span class="font3">booklet with as many as possible. Therefore be sure to include </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font3"> in eaeh combination placed, and before leaving a place where the other literature is not taken present the booklet as a final offer with ihe special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font3"> testimony.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Back Calls on Radio Listeners</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">The large number of letters requesting copies of Brother Rutherford’s lectures over tlie chain broadcasts arc now being bandied in the office and arrangements are made to forward the copies of the lecture to those listening to the first broadcast : tlie, others will follow in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After tlie lecture is mailed we arc sending ihe names of these people to the different companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries throughout Ihe country, to be called uiH'ii immediately. Please give this matter preferred attention. As soon as you get your list of names see that prompt effort is made to eall upon these people and give them an opportunity to obtain all of Brother Rutherford's hooks. In the case of large companies where there are a number of pioneers and auxiliaries working in conjuricl ion with the company, all tlie names are forwarded to the service director. He should distribute them among the pioneers pariJeularly, and where the pioneers cannot handle them tlie others, of course, can be distributed among the oilier company workers. See that the names are given to brethren who are competent to eall upon these people and explain the I.mill and present tlie books in a proper way. We shall be glad to hear of any ouislanding experience connected with the reception you receive from these people.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Report on Radio Dramas</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">The whole-hearted and enthusiastic cooperation of Ihe brethren in reporting on the radio dramas put on over WBBR between 6 and 7 a.m. on Sunday, April 2, Wednesday, April. 5, and Wednesday, April 12, is much appreciated and helps us in ascertaining what portions of the field we can rcneli through WBBR when there is no interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The good receplion .*irea on Sunday morning, when the weather was fairly good for radio reception, covered all of New England, New York state, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio, as well ns Ilie province of Ontario from Sault Sie, Marie east to Ottawa and as far north as North Bay. By “good reception area” is meant where tlie brethren who have fairly good radio sets can get l.lie program without interference. Some of the programs came in faint in certain sections. In other sections within that urea, of course,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Canadian Radio Commission refused to allow even announcements of Brother Rutherford's lecture &quot;Tlie Way of Escape&quot; and tlie two following lectures to be broadcast over Canadian stations. However, tlie brethren are not discouraged, but are fighting harder than ever. 274,000 radio folders were distributed so tliat people of Canada might hear the special broadcast on April 16. In addition to this, arrangements were made to advertise the lecture in the prominent newspapers. Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada are greatly enthused over the three special radio lectures, and reports indicate that these lectures were very well received there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CUBA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I am pleased to state I was with the brethren of Bancs and we had things all fixed for the lecture. It came through very clear. A gathering of over 200 heard same and was very pleased.” Banes is Jocnl.ed in the eastern end of the island.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(Anderson, 8. C.) “On or about the 21st of March a magistrate of ihe township took by force (and at the poiut of a gun) one chicken coop and five hens. They were not used in evidence or mentioned at trial, lie yet holds the coop and liens. The officer also gave me a beating when confiscating same.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Clinton, Iowa) “The chief of police looked over the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font3"> booklet and studied tlie two trial pictures and said, ‘You don’t think much of police and judges, do you? I don’t wonder at your being arrested distributing that.’ ’They were very sore when 1 refused Io pay the fine, and the sheriff was ready wailing to hurry us off to jail. We were freed today at: about 10 a.in. and rejoice that deliverance was wrought for us and we can proceed Ihe remainder of the special period. The three days’ jail lias done us no harm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Hillside, N.J.) &quot;We were working for about a half hour when a sedan pulled up with (wo delectives in it. They asked wiinl. kind oi work we were engaged in, and if we were going around for members. I said, ‘We are not interested in getting members, neither are we collecting money; in fact we are giving most of these booklets away. I will show you how we present this message to the people.’ I gave him the entire testimony. When leaving, this detective put his hand to his mouth and in a low tone said. ‘I am in harmony' with it.’ For the rest of the day we were not bothered any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">- AND NOW WHAT?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to proclaim the message of truth. They will put in more time and energy so that the Ixird’s kingdom will be pieaehed in all tlie world for a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">there were pockets where the brethren could not gel. the programs so well, bul, on the whole, within the urea above mentioned brethren with fairly good sets had very little difficulty in receiving Ihe program on that Sunday morning. The two Wednesdays following, however, being rainy and cloudy, made receplion very poor all over the east except in 'the immediate vicinity of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A great ninny brethren who never thought it was possible to get WBBR on the devotional program between 6; 30 and 7:00 are now getting it regularly because it was demonstrated in this expert merit that our station can be brought in very well nt (hat Hine of the day.</span></p>

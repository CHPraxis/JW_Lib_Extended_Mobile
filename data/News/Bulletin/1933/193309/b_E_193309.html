<div>
<p><span class="font3">The appropriateness of this title, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Proclamation Period,</span><span class="font3"> at this time is emphasized hy the statement appearing in the August 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-tower:</span><span class="font3"> “Now there is revealed to those who have taken their stand on .Jehovah's side the groat truth that there is rapidly approaching a time of unprecedented prosperity and blessings for the human race. Those who arc diligent to grasp the truths that are placed before them are lifted far above the present sad conditions of this world and sec the incontrovertible proof that the time of deliverance is at baud.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This marvelous vision is given to the anointed now’ for their encouragement in pushing the battle to the gate. The insufferable arrogance and defiance of the Devil and his representatives before Jehovah is increasing daily. They are desperately straining every nerve to stop the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. The opposition is world-wide, aud it can truly he said now that ‘all nations arc being gathered against Jerusalem to battle’. Gog is desperately trying to keep the people in ignorance of the Kingdom, but he cannot succeed. With the vision of the Kingdom which the Lord has given his anointed, enabling them to see the Inspector General of Jehovah's host inspecting the city of Jerusalem and measuring the earth, they realize that he is cognizant of all that is taking place and is directing the issue to the praise of Je-hovali’s name. They have implicit confidence in him and those of the truly anointed cannot be turned aside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ In </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah has equipped the anointed with the most pointed message ever delivered upon the earth since the days of our Lord, proving beyond all doubt that the battle of the great day of God Almighty is imminent; that the so-called “Holy Year” will provide no way of escape for the people and that the kingdom of God under Christ is here aud it Is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">. only refuge. This message, when ■</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">broadcast over the chain hook-up by Brother Rutherford, created panic among the enemy’s forces. They did everything within their power, bringing all conceivable pressure to bear upon the radio stations to keep them from broadcasting it, but to no avail, it went forth under the Lord’s direction, Afterwards, when it was broadcast by transcription over more than 150 radio stations, ttie enemy’s forces renew ed their efforts, increased their opposition by bringing intimidation, coercion, and every other weapon they had in their control, to bear upon the radio stations in an endeavor to have the message taken off the air; and now, when this message is going forth by portable transcription machine, we are in receipt of reports already advising that the Catholics are putting forth every effort to have this message stopped in iheir respective local commoniI ies. Where local business men or school boards control the auditorium where the message is to he given they try to bring pressure to bear on these to have the permit to use the auditorium withdrawn; they try to bring pressure to bcar on local authorities to have the message prohibited from public parks and other public places ; but just as sure as the Lord had the message broadcast over the radio stations in the chain hook-up and over more than 150 stations by electrical transcriptions, just so surely may bis people expect success in putting this message on by portable transcription machine in their respective areas. Do not permit anything to stop you. Go forward with implicit confidence. Insist on the various ones with whom you contract to use their hall that they carry out their part of the contract. If they do not, but insist on closing i( down, make arrangements for announcing to the people (when they assemble there) of some other nearby location, out in a field or park or any place you can put on the records, where the people can listen to them. This is a real fight and must be pushed with determination and zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, the broadcasting of the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">My beloved Brethren;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures and the physical facts abundantly prove that the battle of the great day of God Almighty is near at hand. There arc millions of persons of good will who desire to learn the way of escape. Jehovah has committed to his witnesses the great privilege of informing the people that he is the Almighty God, and that the only way of escape is to his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This good news of the kingdom must now be preached to all the world as a witness, and you will prove your love for Jehovah by joyfully participating in that work. The booklet ESCAPE TO THE KINGDOM, which contains that message, will be available to all witnesses by the latter part of September. Be fully prepared to participate in the work from September 30 to October 8. May I suggest the following brief testimony in connection with the booklet:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">I have come to bring you a message of good cheer, and when you hear it your heart will be glad. The times are very hard and the people continue to suffer, and there is just one way of escape from even greater trouble. Jehovah God has provided that way, and it means safety and prosperity to those who learn about it and follow in it. This booklet (producing the booklet) gives a clear and plain statement of just what everyone now needs to know. You will want to be able to tell your friends and neighbors about it. Would you like to read the booklet and contribute five cents to help get it into the hands of others? If so you may be assured of the Lord’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The enemy will make a desperate effort to prevent you from doing this witness work, but remember that you are a representative of Jehovah and against such no weapon can prevail. (Isaiah 54: 17) Be of good courage and continue to sing Jehovah’s praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brother and servant by His grace,</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> j) </span><span class="font3">done speedily. The Lord has provided us with all the necessary means. He has overruled the advertising of the message so that everyone will </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">want </span><span class="font3">to read it, Catholic, Protestant and Jew, as well as those who claim they do not believe in the Bible at all. The common people heard the message over the air gladly, and rejoiced in it, and are waiting for you </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">call with their copy of it. It is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">leaders, particularly </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">among the </span><span class="font3">Catholics, who are bringing pressure to bear to have this message stopped, and this should be most encouraging to all of Jehovah’s anointed and is proof conelusivb that it is having its effect among the Catholic people to such an extent ■ that the leaders arc desperately trying to stop </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period the Lord used his people throughout the earth to give the tremendous witness of over 0,600,000 testimonies, and almost four million pieces of literature were placed in the hands of the people. Undoubtedly the Kingdom Proclamation Period is going to exceed this to a considerable extent in countries where it is possible to place this message in the hinds of the people. In some countries, of course, the activity has been temporarily slopped, but the Ijord is cognizant of this also and permitting it for a good purpose. In the other countries, the tremendous interest created hi Ilie message, the more favorable weather conditions in the fall In this northern hemisphere, where the great majority of the brethren live, and the fact that the people of the world are going Into another winter with practically no relief from the miseries that they have endured in the past, will cause tfie peojile to be on the lookout for some way of escape. Therefore, with all those favorable circumstances we should reasonably anticipate from 10 to id percent increase in every country where the witness work is carried on. We would therefore suggest to the brethren throughout the earth, whether it Im a branch, company, sharpshooter, pioneer or auxiliary, or those who hope to be of the Jonadab class, that for this period a quota be established 15 percent greater than that for the Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period. Undoubtedly the Lord will add the increase to the resufls of our efforts if we go forward in faith. The circumstances seem to justify our expectation of this increase. However, keep in mind that tins cannot be done in our own strength. Each one must look to Jehovah and go forward in this battle with the one predominant thought that that which is being done will redound to the praise of Ills name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You have all read Brother Rutherford’s letter in the August </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> and have been thrilled as he forcibly places before us the importance of this real issue. For the September </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> Brother Rutherford has forwarded from Paris another letter, with a brief, pointed ami forceful testimony to be delivered when yon present </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom.</span><span class="font3"> Our experience In the past has proved the advantage of these testimonies. They are unquestionably from the Lord aud should be used liy the brethren throughout the earlji. The time has come for unity to exist among the people of God, not ouly in action, hut: also In the presentation of the message. By using this testimony this unity of presentation will be attained. Everyone will agree that the message contained in the booklet for the people is from Jehovah, It is equally true that Jehovah provides the method of presentation in order Unit the importance of the message might be properly placed be-</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Proclamation Period &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Appointments will be made of service leaders from the 'Bethel family to participate in the work with companies within a radius of 200 miles of Brooklyn for the first and second week-ends of Kingdom Proclamation Period. Companies within this radius desiring to have one of these brethren serve with them should write to the Service, Department as early aS possible, so that the schedule may be made up. Please specify whether you wish the appointment for the first week-end, September 30 and October 1, or for the second, October 7 and 8, If you have any preference.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Report for Kingdom Proclamation Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Sept. 30-Oct. 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each service director, sharpshooter, pioneer and auxiliary is to make out a report card covering I he field witness activities during the. Kingdom Proclamation Period. This special report Is to be made out on one of the regular monthly report cards, and liiis card is to be headed by you, ‘‘Kingdom Proclamation Period, Sept. 30-Oct. 8.” As quickly as possible after the close of this period, tins report is to be sent iu to the Society,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">AS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION, your report for .the month of September is to close on the 29th. In other words, your September report will include all the work done during September except the last day of the month, or the beginning of the special period, September 31). Therefore your September report will be from September 1 to the 29th inclusive; and the October report, from September 30 to October 31 inclusive.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">fore them in the most effective way. This letter is being supplied in advance to all the branches throughout the earth so that it can be printed in .their </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> and thus uniformity of presentation may be had by all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It Is hoped that the brethren in the United Slates will reach a total of over two million testimonies in this period, and over 300,000 hours, mid make over 900,000 placements, and leave a million pieces of literature with the people. In view’ of all the advertising this message has received throughout this country, we believe this is a very conservative estimate. All directors, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries and Jouadabs who hope to have part in this service to the praise of Jehovah’s name should see to it that all preparations for the campaign are made well in advance. If possible to get time off from your secular employment for this work, arrange to do so. Those who have not had 1 heir vacations should arrange for their vacations to embrace this Kingdom Proclamation Period. Purely the children of Zion who are now taught of Jehovah can do no less than put in as much time as in the last special period, am! undoubtedly they will all want to do much more. All the branches arc putting forth every effort to have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom </span><span class="font3">available in more countries than those In which the Crisis booklet was available, and we feel confident that the magnitude of this message will exceed anything to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let each one, therefore, take this matter before the Lord. Pray for a wider door of service for yourself and for all the anointed of Jehovah throughout the earth and then, in harmony with that prayer, go forward in the service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Method of Reporting Important</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses, whether under the sharpshooter or tho company arrangement, that owns and uses a portable transcription machine for playing Brother Rutherford’s records, should appoint a competent brother to have charge of this work. Wherever possible the service director or sharpshooter should be assigned to this duty. All correspondence and reports to the Society are to be handled by this brother. Therefore the name and address of the one so appointed to serve should he sent in to this office as soon as possible, so that our records may he accurate and that all future instruct ions, records, etc., may he forwarded to the said party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren who have been thus appointed to supervise the portable transcription machine work are requested to make regular monthly report of that work direct to this office. The I’.T.M. reports arc to be inttde out promptly at the close of each month on the special report cards furnished for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">DIVISIONAL MACHINES: In cases where the machine is owned by a division, the one appointed by the division to take charge of the transcription work is to make these monthly reports, and NOT the service director, sharpshooter, or pioneer who may have used the machine during the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">MACHINES IN COMPANY TERRITORY : Where one or more machines are operated in company or sharpshooter territory, the P.T.M. ‘reports should be made by the one appointed by the company to supervise the transcription work in its</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ammunition for the Divisional Campaigns, September 3 and 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In harmony with the special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> just issued, the material for the month of September will be the booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">11 eaven and Purgatory, War or Peace, Crimes and Calamities, Prohibition,</span><span class="font3"> and the special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> carrying Brother Rutherford’s Plainfield lecture and his letter to the Catholic Press of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the divisional campaigns on September 3 and 4 this literature Is to be used exclusively. 'Ilie </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom, </span><span class="font3">booklet, of course, will be filed with the chief of police, but for the month of September the ammunition to be used in the field is going to be this special literature. Everyone should get behind it and push this campaign with enthusiasm and see that some of this literature is left in every home he calls upon. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font3"> of course, will be left in each home whether the people contribute toward the work- or not. Each one of the brethren throughout the country should have some part in this campaign. Make it lhe biggest campaign to date, and the most effective witness against the enemy's stronghold. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">August Reports</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Il is absolutely necessary to have a complete summary of die activities of the different branches of the Society early in October. Wc have to commence assembling the records early in September. We are hereby asking each director, pioneer, auxiliary and sharpshooter to cooperate with ns in this by mailing your AUGUST territory. Foreign and Colored companies (ihat are organized for service) and sharpshooters in company territory are exceptions and should submit their own reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">PIONEER A N D AUXILIARY MACHINES: Pioneer and auxiliary brethren who have machines should make a separate report of their machine activities direct to this office as pioneers and auxiliaries; exception, in cases where a pioneer or auxiliary is appointed by the company to direct the activities of the company’s machine. Then the card should he cheeked as coming from the company, find NOT from the pioneer or auxiliary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">MACHINES IN ISOLATED TERRITORY: Brethren owning and operating machines not in company or sharpshooter territory and who are not organized for service should make separate P.T.M. reports direct to this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In eases where the machines arc operated in several counties during the month it is NOT necessary to make a separate monthly report for the activities In each county. Only a combined monthly report Is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Courtly Sheets are supplied for the purpose of keeping a record of the transcription machine activities carried on in each county. ’These arc to be used in accordance with the instructions on these County Sheets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Users and operators of divisional and company machines should obtain all their supplies, Instructions, placards, etc., from the one appointed io supervise the activities of the machine. The Society does NOT send placards, records, or instructions to anyone except the person in charge of the machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">report, immediately after the first of SEPTEMBER, and your September report as early as possible in October. Please do this. ALSO, send in all back reports. Month after month we have to write, to SHARPSHOOTERS especially, and some directors, pioneers and auxiliaries, for their reports. This not only means holding up the Lord’s work, but also means paying out to the enemy’s organization from fifteen to twenty dollars each month for postage, This should not be. Let each one do his part to comply with the Society’s requirements. Mail your, reports promptly; and any you have missed, please send in before September 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">No. 116 Bible Reduced to 75c</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are pleased to announce that from now on the No. 116 Bible may be placed with the people whenever a contribution of 75e Is received, in-,si end of $1.00 as heretofore. So i hat tho brethren can afford to do Hiis, there will be a corresponding reduction in the company, pioneer anil auxiliary rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In receiving the Kingdom message from Jehovah’s witnesses, many of i he people wish to have a Bible to prove that which they hear and read in Ilie books. This special No. 116 Bible 1ms been purchased from an nulside eom-erri to meet this demand, but it is to be remembered that the placing of these Bibles with the people should be along with some of the hooks. Unless the people have some key- to understanding that nhic’u they read therein, there is liltie likelihood of their getting an idea of the real issues which arc Important for everyone to understand at the present time.</span></p>

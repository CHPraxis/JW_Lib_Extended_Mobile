<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Listen In</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Make Special Report of Reception</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These dramas are of special interest to the brethren throughout the country because they are the exact reproduction of two court trials recently held in New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The first drama, “Conspiracy,” reenacts the trial at Bergenfield, N. J., in which 31 of our brethren were tried and 23 of them convicted and locked up for 7 days in Hackensack jail. The second drama, “Hypocrisy,” portrays the trial of 18 of our brethren at Long Branch, N. J., in which all of them were tried and convicted and given suspended sentence. To the anointed the real value of these broadcasts is that the depict the absolute fearlessness and Implicit confidence which Jehovah’s witnesses must and do now manifest as they are brought before the rulers to deliver the testimony for which the Lord has them brought there. Note also how these brethren always tried to bring in as evidence portions of the Order of Trial that the brethren who appeared before them were unable to present, and further, how each one stayed right with the Order of Trial even though not permitted to read It, and all questions were answered from the testimony appearing therein, and were not turned aside from this either by the brazen and arbitrary attitude of the conspirators or the suave hypocrisy of the latter. Jehovah’s witnesses now realize keenly that “politeness” and “soft words” cunningly spoken by agents of Satan’s tottering organization are not to be taken seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We believe that the brethren throughout the United States can hear the drama broadcast between 0: 00 and 7: 00 a.ra. Eastern Stand-(Continued on page 2, column 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Surely It Will Be the Greatest Witness Week Ever</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare for Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Lord has. another big. surprise for his witnesses for The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period; and here it is,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A BIG CHAIN RADIO HOOK-UP</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ON SUNDAY, APRIL 16, from 7 to 8 p.m., Eastern Standard time. Brother Rutherford himself will speak on the subject “The Way of Escape”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What a dessert for a Thanksgiving feast! Since we just received the good news ourselves, we are rushing through this special </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font9">so that you may share with us in the pleasure of anticipation and PREPARE FOR ACTION.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Surely the Lord is good to his people. For their Thanksgiving day he spreads a feast lasting for 9 days. On the second day, the remnant partake of tlie Memorial emblems not only of their participation in the death of his beloved Son but also</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Wide Advertisement io Be Madeof Hook-up</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Folders to Be Furnished Free</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In order to get as large an audience as possible listening to the big broadcast of the message “The Way of Escape”, on April 16, the Society is going to consign free of charge to every company, sharpshooter, pioneer and auxiliary special radio folders announcing this big hook-up. The people must know about it, if they are to hear it. The Devil-controlled press cannot be relied upon to notify them concerning Jehovah’s message. Jehovah’s witnesses must do it themselves. You will have a part in this work throughout The Remnant’s Thanksof their blessed privilege of sharing with him in the Kingdom joy. Jehovah arms them with the new booklet, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis,</span><span class="font9"> a subject which is daily being blazed forth in the headlines of all the papers. He puts the . Wauls in their mouths wjth.thejspe-cial testimony, which is short, to the point, brings the question squarely before the people as to why this present crisis exists, and will enable his witnesses to cover the territory quickly. AND NOW lie adds to their joy by permitting them to arrange for another big radio chain broadcast that the people may receive additional Information on “The Way of Escape”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Tills big hook-up will mean that every witness in the United States and Canada will have the opportunity of sharing in making it a success. How? Millions of radio announcements are to be printed. For the people to know about this important lecture, these announcements must be distributed. The lecture coming at the end of the Thanksgiving Period will mean that their distribution can be made at the same time the testimony for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis </span><span class="font9">giving Period, April 8-16, but remember it is to be done while you are giving the people the testimony concerning “The Crisis”. First give the testimony suggested by Brother Rutherford, then an invitation to listen to the lecture, accompanied by a radio folder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If toward the end of the week you find that by proceeding in this manner you will not have'dlstrlbut-ed all the folders before the time of the lecture, arrange to spend a few hours In the evening distributing the folders exclusively. While it is Important that all the announcements get into the hands of the people, this work should be done so as not to interfere with the distribution of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font9"> booklet. is given. To get out all of them before the lecture will necessitate quick action, long hours In the field, and close adherence to the printed testimony. Long-winded arguments and discussions will have to be curtailed i for hasfe must be made from door to door to cover as much territory as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Importance of leaving a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis </span><span class="font9">booklet In every home dally increases as the people are coming to realize that they are faced with such a crisis as never before. During The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period special effort is to be made to acquaint the people with the real issue involved. The booklet will make them more anxious than ever to listen to Brother Rutherford Sunday evening and to find out “The Way of Escape”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The time for the lecture has been set at the best hour of the day, so that all who desire to listen may have the opportunity. From 7 to 8 p.m. Eastern Standard time will mean 6 to 7 p.m. Central time, 5 to 6 p.m. Mountain time, and 4 to 5 p.m. Pacific time. Never have -we had a broadcast at a more favorable hour; never has there been one on a more timely subject; never was It more Important fbr Jehovah’s witnesses to notify the people concerning it; and never were conditions better for doing this, with the special nine-day service period preceding it. We can therefore joyfully anticipate the greatest audience ever listening to the Kingdom message; for “THE CRISIS” is at hand. The people want to know “the way of &gt;• escape”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">THE LORD CALLS HIS PEOPLE TO ACTION. He has placed within their hands the message. “The Crisis” is here. The time to notify the people concerning it and “The Way of Escape” must not be put off. Nothing is more Important to the remnant than the doing of that which the Lord has given them to do, at the time and in the way appointed. This unity in action will result in such a beautiful chorus of praise and thanksgiving being (Continued on page 2, column 4)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Want a Part in Serving the Rulers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>at the Capital?</span></h5>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Read Instructions Carefully and Be There for Action</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>What a Week</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>This One Will Be!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The issue is now dearly drawn. The claim is made that present governments shall endure. Jehovah says they cannot endure, but that on their ruins he will establish a now and perfect government which will stand forever. Notice of this issue must be given to the rulers and the people. They must know the crisis is here and that there is no alternative; Jehovah’s kingdom only shall prevail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That this issue may be placed squarely before the rulers as well as the people, a special campaign is being arranged for Washington, D.C.. on Saturday, April 15, in which it is hoped that the president, every member of the cabinet, all congressmen, senators, and government employees, and the members of foreign legations, in fact, every person who is connected with this or any other government represented in Washington, will be served with the Cri-si-s booklet and an invitation to listen iu to a nation-wide special chain radio broadcast on “THE WAY OF ESCAPE”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">. Do you wish to have a part in that campaign? If you do and can comply with the conditions, you may have a part therein. Here is the arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are inviting the three divisions immediately adjacent to Washington to assemble as divisions. These are the divisions with headquarters at Philadelphia. Pa., Baltimore, Md., and Richmond, Va. Every worker in those divisions who can be in Washington by 7:00 o’clock Friday evening, April 14, is invited to come and participate in the campaign. All other individuals or car groups outside of these divisions who wish to participate in the campaign and can be in Washington at 7:00 p.m. Friday, April 14, may also come. It must be kept in mind, however, that this work is of great importance, and the detailed instructions covering it are so essential that they must be thoroughly assimilated by each one who goes into action, and that anyone who cannot get to Washington by 7: 00 o’clock Friday evening, April 14, to get these instructions cannot have a part in the campaign. Therefore, if you are unable to make it by that time, do not go at all. It creates considerable confusion to try to work last-minute arrivals into the organization. The big job at Washington will be on Saturday morning, when the workers who are thoroughly instructed, and who can be depended upon to carryout in detail those instructions, will be dispatched to their territory.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">REGISTRATION SUP</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Fill in a card for EACH car group of workers. Typewrite or plainly print by hand. Send promptly to campaign headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Name &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street City &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">There will be sufficient territory for those who are in the work at Washington on Saturday to stay over and work In the residential sections on Sunday; but do not come to Washington simply for Sunday’s activity, for the witness is just as important in the residential sections of your own territory as it is in those of Washington, and the additional time, effort and expense that would be required in going to Washington for Sunday’s activity may be devoted to witnessing at your home. But for those who are there on Saturday and wish to stay over for Sunday there will be plenty of territory ; and If any of the brethren wish to come to Washington earlier in the week and work with the Washington company, they may do so. Pioneers driving to this campaign and wishing to make a few stops en route may apply to any company service director for territory and this will be the authority for the service directors to fully cooperate with them by supplying territory and any other assistance they may be able to give. We hope to have at least 1,000 workers ready for service Friday evening; but may we again here emphasize that if you cannot get to Washington by Friday evening, don’t go at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Workers who have been cooperating with the divisional leaders at Baltimore. Philadelphia or Richmond will please fill in the ''Registration Slip” (printed below in this </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Utllletin)</span><span class="font9"> and forward the necessary information to your divisional leader. At Philadelphia it will be Royal F. Spatz, 2123 N. 12th St. For the Baltimore area it is C. C. Fisher, 130S Eutaw PI.; and for the Richmond, Va., area, Russell R. Miller, 3023 Hanes Ave., Richmond, Va.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For those workers who are not connected with either of the above divisions but are planning to serve at this campaign, please fill in the registration slip and mail direct to C. W. Jackson, 1603 Massachusetts Ave. NW., Washington, D.C. As far as possible, submit the names in car groups. If you do not have enough workers to fill your car, mark that on the registration slip and state how many more workers you can take.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>A Special Outline Suggested</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A copy of an outline for the meetings in which the transcription machines are used has been sent to all companies, pioneers, sharpshooters and auxiliaries. This program should be consulted in the arrangement of all your meetings. The Society will bo able to furnish the musical records at cost. We have a selection of three or four which will be appropriate. The use of the musical record in the opening will help to assemble and quiet the audience preparatory to the opening prayer. Some of the brethren might like to obtain their own 33J-RPM records, but we strongly recommend that if you do so you do not obtain vocal selections or hymns. It is best to get good high-class orchestral records or organ music. The Society has made a selection of a few, and will be glad to furnish these to Illi' brethren if they so desire, at 75c each, postage prepaid as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Remember that when you obtain these special musical records they are your permanent property to be used regularly at such meetings.</span></p>

We are in receipt of letters from practically every state in the Union, as well as eastern Canada and Nova Scotia, advising of splendid reception of the regular devotional program between 6:30 and 7:00 every morning. Therefore we are asking the brethren throughout the country to put forth a special effort to get these programs and send us a post card to WBBR. 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N. Y.. advising how they were received, how many brethren heard the program, what kind of reception (was it clear, noisy or fading?!. and your general impression of the entire program; also any other items of interest that might be helpful in putting on future programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Remember, the first of these dramas, “Conspiracy,” will be broadcast on Sunday mobning, April 2, between 6: 00 and 7: 00, Eastern Standard time, and the second. “Hypocrisy,” on Wednesday morning, April 5, at the same hour, between 6: 00 and 7: 00, Eastern Standard time.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Needles for Portable Transcription Machine Records</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Great care must be taken in playing Brother Rutherford’s jranscrip-tion records and in the type of needle used. The clarity and effectiveness of the presentation is dependent upon the attention given to these details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For the very best results the Columbia electrical transcription needles should be used. Do not use any other tyi&gt;e of needle on Brother Rutherford’s records, and when purchasing your needles clearly state that they are to be used for playing &quot;.23a revolutions per minute&quot; records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you are unable to obtain this type of needle locally, the Society-will be glad to procure them and send them to you. The Columbia needles come in packages of 100, at 25c a package.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL NOTICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">USE A NEW NEEDLE EACH TIME YOU PLAY ONE OF BROTHER RUTHERFORD’S RECORDS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For long-playing music records use THE NEW RCA VICTOR CHROMIUM NEEDLES FOR LONG-PLAYING RECORDS. This is an orangecolored needle which comes in packages of six, at 25c a package. Do not accept the new RCA Victor chromium needle which comes in the silver-gray packages, for they are to be used on &quot;78 revolutions per minute” records only. The needles for the long-playing music records may be used ten times, at least, before renewing. See the instructions on the package. These needles may also be procured through this office, if you have difficulty in getting them locally.</span></p>

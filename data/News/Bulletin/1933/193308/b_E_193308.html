<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Transcription Speeches Arouse Great Interest in Message of New Booklet</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“God’s typical people celebrated two periods of the year; one in the spring and orle in the autumn season, Those periods were ‘holy unto the Lord’. Why should not God’s anointed people specially observe during the year two days of joy, thanksgiving and praise unto Jehovah. God? ‘The joy of the Lord is your strength.’ The Lord ‘has given us an understanding of his word’ and continues to graciously ‘feed us upon food that is convenient’. The kingdom Is here and progresses, and our business is to sing forth the praises of Jehovah God and, as his witnesses, to hear testimony to his ’ name.”—The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> February - ■ 15 1932.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">September 30 to October 8 is to be the autumn “period of joyful ' thanksgiving, praise and service unto Jehovah God, a feast to the prosperous kingdom work”, and therefore It is designated Kingdom Proclamation Period. To be sure, there are other service periods during the year in which the remnant delight to . put forth a special effort to sing forth the Lord’s praises, but, these . being seasons of special feasting upon the goodness of Jehovah, it is the desire of the remnant to make each one of these spring and fall thanksgiving periods bigger and better than ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brother Rutherford is so impressed with the importance of this fall period that he has addressed a special letter “to Jehovah’s witnesses in all the earth”, sending it to ■ us from London, England, so that It may be received by Jehovah’s witnesses in the August issue of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font1"> regardless of where they may be. AU branch offices that publish their own </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> will carry a translation of this letter in their <sub>h</sub> own particular language for the benefit of the workers in their land. You will be richly blessed as you </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">. read </span><span class="font1">it and see. more than ever the importance of putting forth every possible effort to give thanks unto the Lord, by actively engaging in proclaiming the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For a practical example of what would be pleasing and acceptable to Jehovah in these feast seasons, It is well to briefly consider what he required of his typical people. These experiences were recorded for our learning, upon whom the ends of the i ages have come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">First: They were holy unto Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Second: Every male member of Israel was bound to appear before Jehovah at the sanctuary at Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Third: There was a general occasion set apart from servile work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fourth: The first and last days of the feast were entirely devoted to the service of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This strongly indicates that the anointed and all who love Jehovah should wholly set themselves on his side and strive for the prosperity of Jerusalem, cutting off and laying aside all hindrances to the service work; wherever possible getting OiT Some or all of the time from secular employment for this occasion, and especially setting aside the first and last Saturdays and Sundays of the campaign for the exclusive service of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the Lord was pleased with and accepted this typical service of Israel, with greater reason we may expect him to be pleased with the-whole-hearted participation of his people now in that which Israel’s ceremonies typified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Kingdom Proclamation Period being a season of feasting and rejoicing, Jehovah has provided his people with something special to make their hearts glad. That special course for the feast is to be a new 64-page booklet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom.</span><span class="font1"> Fifty-two countries were able to use the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font1"> booklet during the spring International Thanksgiving Period, and every effort Is to be made to get this booklet published in even more languages and shipped in advance to all countries, so that all of the brethren can share In its distribution during Kingdom Proclamation Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> is just what the people need at this time. It contains the three radio lectures</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">by Brother Rutherford on “The Way Of Escape”, “The Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity” and “Kingdom Blessings for the People”, which were broadcast over a chain of from fifty to sixty radio stations</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">to the cause and the only remedy for world distress. The rulers fail to give heed thereto but continue to declare their ability to bring to the people peace and safety. For them there is no way of escape. The people continue to groan under the ever increasing burdens and to cry for relief. There is no human power that can relieve them. Jehovah commands his witnesses to now raise high his standard and point out to the people that if they would live they must Escape to the Kingdom. (Isaiah 62:10) Every one who' loves Jehovah will obey that commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">September 30 to October 8, 1933, inclusive is designated as The Kingdom Proclamation Period. During that period Jehovah’s witnesses throughout all the countries of the earth will engage in this blessed work. A new booklet entitled ESCAPE TO THE KINGDOM has been specially prepared for this occasion. It is now being printed and will be shipped to your company in ample time for this united witness work throughout the earth. Your heart will burn with joy to again have part with your brethren in making known the name of Jehovah and the blessings he will bring to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period resulted in the greatest distribution of the message ever accomplished to that time. By the Lord’s grace let us make The Kingdom Proclamation Period even a greater witness. Make your arrangements now to devote every hour possible during that period to the witness work. Happy is the lot of every one who has a part now in making known the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. You are in the van of the Lord’s earthly organization and continue to sing the praises of the Most High as you march to the battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">. Fill out your report at the end of the witness period and immediately forward it to the Society’s office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>b</sub>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let all of those who love God continue to pray that Ihj may pour out his great blessing upon this coming witness period to the honor and vindication of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With much love and best wishes, I remain</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Consignments of “Escape”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Included with Orders After August 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To assure an adequate supply of the new booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom,</span><span class="font1"> the Society is arranging to consign to each company, pioneer, auxiliary and sharpshooter whose account is in good condition a supply sufficient to last from the beginning of the Kingdom Proclamation Period until November 1. Additional supplies to completely cover each territory may be ordered afterward. Companies, pioneers, auxiliaries and sharpshooters who have permitted their accounts to get behind should send in their order immediately, with a remittance to cover, for such </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Escape</span><span class="font1"> booklets as they will require to cover their territory. Be sure to do this before August 10, to enable us to make shipment before the closing of the factory on August 19; otherwise you will not have a supply on hand for the Kingdom Proclamation Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The more favorable weather conditions, and the fact that this campaign takes place in the fall, when people generally have more time to read and think and a long winter before them, with promises of pros-(Continued from page 1, column 4) alone will give them the blessings so needed. There is only the one way of escape. The Lord has certainly supplied his people with a timely booklet, right up to the minute, and one which will rejoice everyone of the anointed to have a part in distributing it. Never have we had a booklet which has received wider advance publicity than this one. Just.think of it! Following the chain hook-up, the transcription records which were made of these same lectures were furnished to 170 radio stations, advertised by the distribution of 5,400,-J00 folders throughout the United States and Canada, and again the message was heralded forth in no uncertain tones. But even this is not all. More records were made of the same lectures and supplied for approximately 400 portable transcription machines, and during the three months of July, August and September the same message is being broadcast to many people who do not have radios and who have not had the opportunity to hear the lectures over the air. AND NOW the Lord gives his people the wonderful privilege of taking advantage of this tremendous amount of publicity by having the lectures published in a most attractive booklet so that everyone who contributes the nominal sum of 5 c toward forwarding the work may have his copy and prove that which he has heard, or heard about, from his own Bible. This earth has never seen a feast unto Jehovah so widely heralded and announced to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That the ire of the enemy was aroused by the circulation of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font1"> booklet was quite apparent from the reports of interference in various countries during The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period; but instead of its putting a stop to the work, the Lord overruled, and by His grace unparalleled results were accomplished. That Satan will continue to oppose the work is to be expected, but the remnant will not fear; for “if God be for us, who can be against us”? If the Lord’s time has come for this message to be put in the hands of the people, nothing can stop its being accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cover of the new booklet will thrill you, too, for the picture itself is powerful and striking. God’s righteous judgment in execution perity and plenty unfulfilled, and all efforts to fulfil them collapsing on every hand, all manifesting the inadequacy of the Devil’s system, will create in the honest-hearted a sincere desire for deliverance. This, in addition to the tremendous amount of publicity given to this message, has prepared the entire country for the distribution of this booklet. Therefore there is every reason to believe that it will exceed the distribution of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The consignment of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Escape</span><span class="font1"> will be included with all orders shipped to you from this office after the first of August, as we hope to have all tire consignments shipped before the factory closes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But notice! Do not use the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Escape </span><span class="font1">booklet for public distribution before September 30. Please comply with tbis request. When brethren have taken it upon themselves to distribute a certain booklet before it is released they have caused considerable confusion and embarrassment to other brethren who have complied with the Society’s request. Therefore we ask each one, for the sake of the organization, not to publicly distribute any of these booklets before September 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">against the wicked and corrupt organization of Satan, and the way of escape, beautifully portrayed, fit the contents of the booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If for some unforeseen reason </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> does not reach you in time for Kingdom Proclamation Period, then use the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font1"> booklet in your own language if you have that; and if not, the very latest booklet published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember that your brethren will be fighting with you shoulder to shoulder throughout the entire earth, not with carnal weapons, but with their God-given weapon, the Truth, Reports are to be sent to Brooklyn headquarters by all the branch offices and by isolated brethren in other countries where there are no branch offices, so that again. an international report can be tabulated and given to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If we hope to make Kingdom Proclamation Period even a greater witness than The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period, it will mean everyone’s doing just a little more than he did at that time. Then 58,804 workers reported, on the average, 12.3 hours each, including the many additional hours reported by pioneers, auxiliaries and some company workers. In other words, many put in many more hours than 12,3 in order to bring up to this average the shortage of others. Therefore, in order to obtain better results, let the company workers try to increase their average from 10 to 13 hours, the auxiliaries from 26 to 29, and the pioneers from 42 to 45. Placements come as a result of giving the testimony. The number of testimonies reported during the spring campaign averaged a little better than 9 per hour per worker. That is truly a remarkable average. It shows that the work was done at top speed; it would be very difficult to cover territory any faster. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">More hours</span><span class="font1"> in the field, therefore, will be necessary to better the results. Each worker throughout the earth, on the average, placed 4.75 pieces of literature per hour. This average was made possible by the large number of booklets given to the people in Germany even though no contributions were received. This also stresses tho importance of each one’s giving </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">more time</span><span class="font1"> to the work than ever if there is to be an increase in total literature distrihnted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have a real task before us, but</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Home and Factory Closed from August 21 to September 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers Should Have Territory to Last</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Through September</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To save yourself, as well as us, a. lot of trouble, please remember that the Bethel home and factory will be closed from August 21 to September 4 in order to permit the brethren here to enjoy a change from their regular occupation. Please do not put off preparing for the period until the last minute; for, if you do, your order may not receive attention until after September 4. It will also help us if you do not write .the office during this period, as accumulated mail adds much to the work upon the reopening of the office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneers, in particular, should be sure that they have enough territory to keep them busy until the middle of October and that their stock of books is sufficient to last them through September. In sending in your orders for shipment just before vacation, please remember to order the number of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font1"> that are desired for the service period September 30 to October 8. This will assure your getting the desired quantity and also save in shipping expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Notice to Countries Where There Is No Branch nor Organized Company </span><span class="font1">A copy of this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font1"> is being mailed to many brethren living in countries where there is no branch office of the Society nor company organized for service. We heartily invite all those who love God to join with Jehovah’s witnesses in carrying the message of the Kingdom to the people. If you desire more information on how to get lined up for the service, we suggest you write to the Brooklyn office. We urge you to make preparations now, so as to have a part in Kingdom Proclamation Period. If you are not located near a company of Jehovah’s witnesses from which you can obtain a supply of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom, </span><span class="font1">send your order direct to Brooklyn now, in order to get the booklets in time. AU such orders should be accompanied with a remittance to cover the cost of the quantity ordered. If ordered in quantities of 50 or more the cost is 3Jc each. This price includes the carriers' charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Its size, instead of disheartening the remnant, will fire them with determination to put forth that added effort which will be needed. It was done once, by the Lord’s grace, and if each one docs his part, looks to the Lord and asks Him for His blessing upon the united efforts of His people, it can be done again by His grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With more and more of the Jona-dab class coming forward and taking their stand. on the Lord’s side, it might be possible to increase the number of participants iis the work. They, of course, should be helped in getting started In the Lord’s service as well as in an understanding of the great purposes of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Kingdom must and will be proclaimed; for Jehovah has so decreed it. Happy is our lot to be privileged at this time to do this work by pointing out to the people that their only means of protection in this great day of crisis and impending destruction upon Satan’s wicked organization Is to “Escape to -the Kingdom”.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Name of JEHOVAH Is a Strong Tower</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">To </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Those Who Dwell in His House</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thanscbiption Meetings Well Attended</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rubber Cement for Pasting Placards</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The remnant rejoice to know that the name of Jehovah is their strong tower! “There must be no divided affection. God preserves and brings into his house only those who love him and serve him in spirit and in truth. To dwell in the house of Jehovah God is the greatest favor that could possibly be bestowed upon any creature. To enjoy that favor one must earnestly and diligently seek after the Lord’s house and faithfully comply with the divine requirements.”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font1"> page 215.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The transcription machines which are in the hands of the brethren are being put to good use in getting out tiie Kingdom message. The early reports indicate good attendance at the meetings. In fact, for 145 meetings held by the pioneers the total attendance has been 7,099, or an average of approximately 49 nt each meeting. They have had many interesting experiences in holding these meetings, and a report </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of such </span><span class="font1">in addition to the regular report card information is appreciated by us; for from these many valuable suggestions can be obtained. Thus, one brother has found that if rubber cement (the stainless kind used in art work) is used in pasting on the placards the announcements of place and time of meeting, the cement will rub right off when the paper Is removed, leaving the poster neat and clean. In leaving these posters In the stores it is well to Impress the storekeeper with the fact that you will call for them after the meeting and that you do not want them destroyed. If .you don’t do this they are likely to be thrown out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another brother writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“You may be interested to know of my experience at an unemployment camp near Jacksonville. We have heen out several times with the machine. There are more than 300 men living at this state military camp. I called on the major and the captain in charge and asked permission to entertain the men for an hour with Judge Rutherford's lectures and a musieal program. Tf&gt;re-seated both with a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis,</span><span class="font1"> and they agreed to post a notice on the board. They put us on the platform for boxing bouts. We tuned up to 70, and you could hear it all over the big camp. Had an audience around the ring of about 100. At the close they gathered around and asked questions. Practically all of them were opposed to religions of today. When we promised to return in two weeks’ time, they asked, 'Why can’t you come next week?’ and so it was ‘next week’ until we made five trips. The electrician delighted to help us get electrical connections. He had been an assistant field manager for NBC, and, I later found out, 'was to put us out of the camp if anything was said that was not O.K.’ The second trip he was glad to accept some booklets and offered to place the whole set of booklets in the camp library, where, he informed me, they were creating much interest. At the last two broadcasts the captain was present, expressing himself as pleased that the men were taking such -interest in a program of that nature. We used two musical records to draw the crowd, and then a lecture with a brief introduction of the judge. These camps may be a place that some of the friends are overlooking. There are many fine fellows among them, and they advertise as they travel.”</span></p>

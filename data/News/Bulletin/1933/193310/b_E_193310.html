<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Brother Rutherford to Speak over More than 100 Stations</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Name of JEHOVAH Is a Strong Tower</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Those Receiving “Preparation” for Final Battle</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■ Jehovah does not need to prepare himself. He is ready at any instant for the greatest emergency that could ever arise. He is all-powerful, all-wise, all-overcoming. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But since 1918 we have been in the “day of His preparation”. In it Satan and his chief prince, Gog, feverishly prepare all their forces, invisible and visible, for the threatening final conflict, knowing that tlie time is short. But “His preparation”, Jehovah’s preparation, is of those who are devoted to him alone and upon whom he has put his own name, the “new name” which his own mouth has named, Jehovah’s witnesses. These are a part of Jehovah’s ‘armies in heaven’, led by his victorious anointed King, Christ Jesus; and these are the ones whom Jehovah lovingly and faithfully prepares that they may stand fast in their integrity during the hottest part of the big fight and may perform the part assigned to them during that fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Undeniably, as a part of “his preparation”, Jehovah now graciously bestows upon his witness on earth the gift of a new book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span><span class="font4"> That it will play a timely and important part in the preparation of his people for the vindication of his name will not be disputed by any who read the book. The thrill which you first feel on reading the preface of the book, or even on seeing the embossed design on the front cover, never leaves you, but continues with you all through the book until it reaches a grand climax in the. as-lt-were eye-witness description of the terrific battle for the vindication of Jehovah’s name and word. Then there still comes the delightful anticlimax as the reader gets glimpses of the Kingdom activities after Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publication of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font4"> Is an added proof that nothing in heaven and earth cau block Jehovah in “his preparation”. Every anointed witness of Jehovah who has taken refuge in His name will want to read this uew book, and will do so, if possible, that he may I:u4r nothing in being prepared for full duty in the divine service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every member of the Jonadab class and those of the “great multitude” of “prisoners” should be able, by His grace, to understand </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span><span class="font4"> And that the opportunity to read and understand may be given them, the Lord has arranged that during the approaching “Jehovah’s Witnesses’ Praise Period”, November 18 to 26 Inclusive, his witnesses shall be privileged to begin distributing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span><span class="font4"> Only the autographed edition will be issued in the meantime, in order that you may first get the blessing out of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font4"> before you pass it on to others who need it. This edition contains Brother Rutherford’s letter to Jehovah’s witnesses, and which will impart a great blessing and stimulation to them, coming, as it does, from one whom Jehovah has used as a foremost witness among his people on earth today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">PREPARATIONI</span><span class="font4"> The name rings as if the great battle were not far distant now. Let no one relax or slack the hand now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The autographed edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font4"> will he ready for distribution October 1. Every one of Jehovah's witnesses should avail himself of this most timely book. In the autographed edition is a letter from Brother Rutherford to all of Jehovah’s witnesses which everyone will want to read, aud all will want to have one of this edition as a permanent copy for study. Tins edition Is being offered, as usual, at 50c a copy, aud what is received Is used to cover the original cost of the typesetting and plate-making so that the editions made later on for the public can be made at a lower cost. In November there will be another special period during which time the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font4"> book will be used, and between October 1 and the latter part of November every one of the remnant and the Jonadab company who engages in the witness work should become thoroughly acquainted with its contents. The Lord has assured us that he will comfort us through the Scriptures, and this he surely does through his gift to his people in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">September Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Send It In on the 29th</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All service directors and sharpshooters should make every effort possible to mail in to the Society their report for the month of September on September 29 or as quickly thereafter as they can. AU the workers are requested to cooperate with their service director or sharpshooter by submitting their individual dally reports promptly. If every one so cooperates, it will enable us to compile an accurate report for the entire year, which fiscal year ends September 29. Pioneers and auxiliaries, of course, are also requested to send in their September report on the 29th of September.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic Coercion Has Not Stopped the Truth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,000,000 Radio Folders to Be Distributed</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>A Coast-to-Coast Network Arranged</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Simultaneously with the Kingdom Proclamation Period Brother Rutherford will again speak to the people of America in person. Catholics, Protestants and Jews and everybody opposed to the witness of the Lord have made a hig fuss and do a lot of talking about what they are accomplishing In removing Brother Rutherford’s lectures from the air. Those who are thoroughly acquainted with the facts, however, know that up to the present the Catholics have persuaded very few stations to drop these lectures. Even in the cities where these lectures have heen discontinued because of: threats aud coercion on the part of tlie Catholic clergy, a greater witness has been given than ever before. And now, iu spite of all this opposition, arrangements are completed for broadcasting a special series of three lectures over a coast-to-coast network in which there will be approximately 100 stations. The subjects are: THE TRUE GOD, on October 1; THE MIMIC GOD, on October 8; and WHY SERVE JEHOVAH, on October 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An intensive campaign should be started immediately and continued during the three weeks in which these broadcasts are made, to Inform everyone about these lectures so that they may tune iu and learn</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lectures Are Having Good Effect</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Use Them Often</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Space will not permit us to print anywhere near the hundreds of very interesting experiences which the brethren are having while putting ou the portable transcription machine meetings. However, we will endeavor to find room for a few which indicate the &quot;Lord’s very evident blessing upon the work aud the resourcefulness of the brethren in taking advantage of peculiar opportunities in order to sing forth the praises of Jehovah through this agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From Georgia we have a report: “The government hospital in the suburbs of Atlanta has been secured for the three lecture series beginning Friday this week. There are many crippled and sick soldiers in this camp and we are looking forward to a good witness.” -the truth. Radio folders are being consigned to all tile companies and sharpshooters and to isolated pioneers aud auxiliaries. Pioneers and auxiliaries working in company territory will get their supply of radio folders through the company. These should be put in the hands of the people, and they should be personally invited to tune In. If they don’t have a radio set, tell them to go to their neighbor who has, because this message Is of vital importance to every creature living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Arrangements should be made to announce these three special lectures over the stations which now carry Brother Rutherford's transcription programs weekly. The one handling the regular announcements for the records should change them so as to include an announcement of the coast-to-coast network in the opening and closing announcement of each program. If the station over which the transcription record is being broadcast is not in the chain, then announce one or two stations which can be very &quot;well heard in that vicinity and which are in the chain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be sure that announcements are made at the transcription meetings, giving this series of three programs real publicity. It is the purpose of Jehovah's witnesses to advertise the <sup>1 </sup>King and Kingdom, and by informing the people of this country of these three vitally important broadcasts we do this very thing and the people will hear again the clear-cut truths which the Lord wants brought forth at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Sunday, August 13, w’e put on a lecture at 11:00 a.m., 'The Way of Escape,’ to 135 colored people in their church. The minister objected. . . . but the board of deacons came up and said, ‘W’e are going to have this lecture. We invited these people here to give us this lecture and we are going to have It.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“A party of pioneers advertised a meeting at Lanette to take place at 2 p.in. at the home of Brother------.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before the hour for the meeting the home was filled and the people w<sup>r</sup>ere standing in the yard and around the house, in all over 150 people. ‘The Way of Escape’and ‘Holy Year’ were given. One lecture was not enough for these: people. Not a single person left’until after the two lectures were completed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From Texas a pioneer writes: “This county was the hardest place to work we ever tried. Two weeks ago we put on the records ‘Holy</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Remnant Are Ready for Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Going On with Joy and Confidence</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We hope that by the time you receive this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> all preparations for the most extensive witness ever given on earth will have been completed. The Kingdom Proclamation Period marks the beginning of the fiscal year 1934, which opens up with a promise of greater privileges than we have ever before enjoyed. The issue is clear-cut now, and the crisis is here, and the anointed are meeting it with joy and confidence.</span></p>

Over 1,100,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ages</span><span class="font4"> vanished as though the earth had swallowed them up (in fact, that is what actually took place) ; and 600,000 old booklets, which we hardly dared hope would be entirely disposed of, kept going out so fast that we found it difficult to keep up with the shipments, and now, the loth of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Proclamation Period Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">September 30-October 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reports for this special period should be sent in to this office not later than seven (7) days after the period is over. The cooperation of every one Is requested so that this may be done and that a prompt and complete report for this period may be tabulated and announced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Consignment of Special Radio Folders</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Five million special' radio folders are beiug printed for the purpose of informing the public of the nationwide chain broadcasts by Brother Rutherford October 1, 8 and 15, and arrangements have been made whereby all the companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries in the United States can have a share in distributing them to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Consignments of these folders are now being shipped direct to the service directors of the English companies, to the sharpshooters, and to the pioneers and auxiliaries located in isolated territory. This means that the colored and foreign companies, pioneers and auxiliaries located in English company territory are to arrange to obtain their folders from the service director of the English company; for they will not receive direct consignments. Also, the pioneers and auxiliaries located in the same town as the sharpshooter are to obtain their folders from the sharpshooter, to whom they will be sent. The pioneers are being allotted 510 of these radio folders,.and the auxiliaries 340. -These brethren should apply for their allotments accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These folders are to be placed in thb hands of the people as soon as possible. Every effort should be made to get them out in time for the first broadcast, October 1. month, we have only </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and Purgatory</span><span class="font4"> left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This clearly demonstrates two great facts: first, that the campaign had the blessing mid direction of Jehovah; and, second, that the anointed, appreciating the satanie attitude of the enemy and their arrogant defiance of Jehovah, gladly accepted the challenge which they threw down, and went forward determined to make known the true facts to the people. It was most thrilling to have some part in this campaign. This campaign also clearly demonstrated that among the Catholic people, as well as others, there are thousands of earnest people who want to know the truth. These people gladly took the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> and (he booklets in order to ascertain the true facts, and now this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> and the booklets have prepared the field for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape </span><span class="font4">as nothing else could possibly have done. Therefore go over the same territory with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape,</span><span class="font4"> The people arc now thinking; they are hungry for facts; they want the truth. It is our privilege to feed them with this heaven-provided food. Show them the way of escape to the Kingdom and how- they may be delivered from the Satanic organization that is oppressing them. Commence the year 1934 with an unequivocal declaration for Jehovah and his kingdom, not by words only, but by actively pushing the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Inventory Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Service directors and sharpshooters are reminded to be sure to send in the September 29 (1933) stock inventory report by October 10, at the very latest. Also to be sure to give the storage information requested in the letter of September 9.</span></p>

The brethren had to work harder this year iu order to place the literature, due largely to the terrible condition resulting from depression.

About 80 people listened. . . . The next Saturday we got permission to put on the record in front of the bank and the main drug store; prohahly 300 or 400 people listened, mostly farmers. The sidewalks were crowded and the people were standing hy the parked cars along the road. The long and short of these experiences is that we placed as many books in the last two days as we did during the 30 days previous. We keep our machine in the car and take the loudspeaker and place It out over the engine, leaning it against the windshield.”-</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">From Kentucky we had a report that “-when the preachers saw the advertisement of the portable transcription meeting they arranged for a big baptismal service and warned the people not to attend Judge Rutherford’s meeting. . . . We waited until the baptismal service was finished. With all arrangements completed for the lecture, we then put on a musical record to attract the attention of the people, and the entire 150 people who assembled at the baptismal meeting came over and heard the lecture ‘The Way of Escape’. Some came in cars and some sat on the schoolhouse steps.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These are only a few of the many interesting experiences that are continually coming in indicating how the Lord is using these machines to the praise of his name. Everyone who owns one of these machines or directs its use should carefully scout around and see if in addition to the parks and other public places there are not hospitals, old folks’ homes, large municipal boarding houses and other places where people congregate, particularly now, with coo! weather setting in, where they can arrange for a series of these meet-</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah in the anointed impelled them to a greater effort, so that they not only maintained last year’s record, but exceeded it by placing the Kingdom message in approximately 360,000 more homes and giving almost 2,900,000 more testimonies than they did in the first nine months of the previous year. These are facts which must bo a source of great joy and encouragement to the anointed everywhere. They are a clear evidence of the Lord’s favor upon our efforts to serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ings. If you put forth the effort, undoubtedly the Lord will open the way and bless it with success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are a few points concerning this work that we should like to cull to your attention again. County sheets should bo kept on file by the service directors, sharpshooters and pioneers and submitted to this office only when the territory is released. In most cases, as far as companies and sharpshooters are concerned, this will simply be a permanent record of the meetings put on in their territory which they themselves are to keep and have available in case the Society requests the information ; but if you relinquish the territory, please send In the report of meetings held in that assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Only one monthly report card is necessary from each group owning and operating machines. If a company has a number of machines, oue report, summarizing the work done, and showing the number of machines in the proper place, is all that is necessary. We do not want a monthly report on each county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under the heading “Total Attendance” is to be reported the entire attendance for the month, including visitors and brethren. Under the heading “Remarks” we should like you to show the general results you are having in the placing of literature and any other interesting experience that might be beneficial to others. In the case of companies’ portable transcription reports, the name of the company should appear as well as the name and address of the brother supervising the transcription activities. In cases where the English companies loan their machines to foreign or colored companies or sharpshooters, the company owning the machine, through the party supervising it, is to make all reports. He is to receive the information from the parties to whom the machine is loaned, summarize that information, and forward it to this office as requested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been noticed in some cases that when the portable transcription machine is on, the machine is kept in view of the audience, and that the brother operating the machine and the brother making the announcement are very conspicuous, whispering to each other about one tiling or another and in this way attracting the attention of the audience to themselves. This should never be. Wherever possible the , body of the machine should be kept out of sight, so that the people will not see the records put on or changed. In many cases when this happens they see the brother running the machine take oil the record or arrange to turn it over, and they think the speech is ended and walk out. Keep the machine out of sight. The short time it takes to turn a record over or to put on another will not be noticed if the audience does not see what takes place. All the brethren who attend those meetings should be as inconspicuous as possible, so that those attending can concentrate on the talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When portable transcription machines are ordered, a supply of musical records and needles should be ordered at the same time. These are not. supplied free hy the Society, and, of &quot;bourse, are sent only’ on the order from the party getting the machine. We have on hand at the present time 4 musical records: 2 singlo-facod records which the Society is able to obtain for the brethren at 75c each, and 2 double-faced records at $1.30 each. This makes 6 musical selections, which the majority of brethren find sufficient. As advised in previous </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins,</span><span class="font4"> the Society is recommending the exclusive use of the Columbia steel needle, which comes in packages of 100, at 2ac a package, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>

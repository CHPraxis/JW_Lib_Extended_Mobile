<p><span class="font4">The knowledge of Jehovah’s kingdom is for all who will hear; Jehovah is no respecter of persons. Throughout the earth there is a large number of people who are physically blind but who hunger for a knowledge of the Lord and his kingdom. Jehovah is cognizant of this and has made adequate provision to supply the needs of these</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Lord foretold that when the enemy would come in like a flood the spirit of Jehovah would lift us up a standard against him. The anointed of Jehovah are facing the greatest crisis that they have faced up to the present time. The enemy Is sparing no effort In his desperate attempt to stem the Increasing tide of Kingdom truth that is going forth throughout the earth portending the destruction of him and his organization. Out of his mouth, particularly as represented in the Catholic Press, is going forth a flood of lies, vilification and misrepresentation intended to influence the minds of the people against the Lord and his kingdom as well as against the Kingdom representatives. Therefore the assurance that at that time the spirit of Jehovah would lift up a standard against them is a clear statement of the Lord’s requirements for his people now. The very evident purpose of this flood of lies, vilifications and misrepresentations, intimidations and coercion, is to frighten Jehovah’s witnesses and to induce the local officials and people to turn against them and destroy them and to again engulf the people in ignorance of Jehovah and of his kingdom arranged for their deliverance and blessing. The enemy would gladly destroy every one of Jehovah’s witnesses if he could. This he cannot do, because Jehovah will not permit it. Jehovah has a work for his people to do now, and that Is to lift up a standard against the enemy. God’s truth, the facts regarding the kingdom of Jehovah and the blessings it will bring to the people, aud the undeniable proof of the wicked practices of the enemy in turning the people away from the Lord to their own destruction, constitute a real standard against him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The first printing of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> will be one million copies for America, and they are to be distributed during the month of September, every one of which is to be placed in the hands of the people before the Kingdom Proclamation Period. This is going to mean real work for each one of the anointed, but these are days of war. The Lord Is pressing the battle to the gate. I-Ie is going to have definite and positive announcement made of this, and it is the blessed privilege of the anointed to be his witnesses bearing testimony to that fact before the rulers and the people. There never was a greater privilege conferred upon any people than is conferred upon the anointed now. This special </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> is to be distributed in conjunction with the special campaign with the four booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and.

<p><span class="font4">It is not the prerogative of Jehovah’s witnesses to force their testimony upon anyone. If any refuse to accept it, that is their responsibility ; therefore do not be unduly insistent or aggressive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">' TERRITORY TO BE WORKED</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Work urban territory, particularly the thickly populated larger cities where the Catholic population predominates, first. Then extend your activities from there to all your urban territory, including Catholic, Protestant, Jews or whatever are in it,, and if you still have additional time before the end of the month, go out Into the rurals and cover every possible home in your territory that is accessible, so that this message will have the widest and most thorough distribution of any we have had to date. All who have charge of territory distribution, whether directors, sharpshooters, pioneers or auxiliaries, will immediately begin making preparations for this campaign. As advised in another part of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin, </span><span class="font4">under “Consignments”, each company and sharpshooter is being shipped approximately 50 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ages</span><span class="font4"> for each worker in the company. Therefore the territory should be arranged accordingly. Work fast and thoroughly. Arrange for everyone in the company to have some part in the work. If some of those who hope to be of the Jonadab class feel that they cannot do regular door to door witnessing with the booklets but would like to have some part in the distribution of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> they may be assigned a territory for the exclusive distribution of this special </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> provided they agree to ring the bell, offer a brief statement to the householder and deliver the copy.

<p><span class="font9">The Plainfield Meeting a Thriller </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord’s Protection Most Manifest</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Now for a Steady Downpour of Truth</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">According to the 1930 census, Plainfield, New Jersey, is a city with a population of 34,422; not so large, but Its officials have been bitter in their opposition to the message of God’s kingdom. On Sunday, July 30, their strong-arm squad attended in force the mass meeting which was held in their city for the purpose of hearing Brother Rutherford deliver a lecture on the subject “Why Religious Intolerance Is Practiced Now in This Country”. Like the worshipers of Baal whom Jehu called together to offer sacrifices unto Baal, they came decked in their robes of identification, handcuffs, ammunition belts, revolvers and sawed-off shotguns ; in fact, armed to the teeth. There were two or three policemen stationed at each of the exits, besides others in plain clotlies who were specially detailed at each exit and throughout the audience. These also carried guns. Even on the platform itself and behind the drop curtain armed guards were stationed, prepared to blaze forth at the least provocation. To the early arrivals this armed guard was so large that it appeared that a policemen’s convention, instead of a Bible lecture, was to be held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An hour or more hefore the meeting time the people began to assemble for the lecture. The day was extremely hot, but many of the order-loving people of Plainfield and vicinity who desire righteousness braved the heat and came early in order to get in. Many brethren had come also to participate in distrlb-uting the invitations to this special mass meeting. Seventeen of .them had been seized by the police the previous day and held in jail to suffer as Christ suffered because of their faithfulness to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Suspicious of every act, the strong. arm squad, upon seeing one brother come in with a package, demanded to know what he had, but he refused to tell. Peremptorily the package was seized and torn open. Much to the chagrin of the officer, instead of finding a bomb or explosives, he found some copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> which were afterwards given free to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By three o’clock the big hall was packed and others had assembled in another theater connected by loudspeaker extension. The audience hung on every word that Brother Rutherford bad to say, as if spellbound. If the officials of Plainfield anticipated the stopping of the meeting by their display of arms, or if they expected that Brother Rutherford would put on the soft pedal, they were quickly disillusioned. Boldly and fearlessly, yet without sarcasm or ridicule or attacking any individuals, the truth was presented to the people of Plainfield and the radio audience. Officialdom was given to understand what the Lord says will happen to them if they oppose Him and oppress, persecute and endeavor to suppress His witnesses. The strong-arm squad were seen paying close attention to the arguments presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the close of his lecture Brother Rutherford offered free to every one present a copy of the special issue of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Aye</span><span class="font4"> containing his open letter to the Catholic Press of America answering their attack on the radio stations in their effort to have his lectures put off the air. Brethren were stationed at the various exits who passed out these copies, and it was especially noteworthy with what eagerness the people received them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the meeting, the brethren who had been present assembled in a grove which had been used as the contact point for the distribution of the mass meeting announcements. Brother Rutherford had arranged with the police captain to release the brethren who were in jail, and the meeting in the park was delayed until these seventeen had been brought there from jail. Brother Rutherford then spoke to the brethren for a few minutes, outlining the big campaign to be made with this special issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Aye</span><span class="font4"> and bringing to their attention words of encouragement from the Lord’s Word. All went home rejoicing greatly in the privilege which the Lord had granted to them that day of being his witnesses and having been present at this meeting at which the protection of the Lord, in spite of the strong-arm squad of Satan’s organization, was so clearly manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And now, after such a thrilling meeting at which the Lord’s protection and blessing was so clearly manifest, all the remnaut throughout America can press the battle to the gate. This lecture sent to His people from the Lord will be put into </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> form and will soon be ready. During the month of September all of the anointed should be prepared to distribute the first million edition of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> and all the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and Purgatory, Grimes and Calamities, War or Peace</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibition,</span><span class="font4"> booklets that are now in stock. These booklets with the special </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> will undoubtedly make the Catholics and their allies more vicious in .their attack than before. How<sup>j</sup>ever, the September campaign will just be a beginner and will get the brethren in good fighting action for the Kingdom Proclamation Period, in which </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom,</span><span class="font4"> containing the “Holy Year” lecture, will be distributed far aud wide. What a blessed privilege tbe Lord’s people have now, to be engaged in a work that must be done speedily 1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column,</span><span class="font4"> J) ber. Commencing with the Kingdom Proclamation Period fill in the report card as usual. Do not include any </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ages</span><span class="font4"> on your report card after the end of September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TRANSCRIPTION MEETINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At all of these meetings arranged during the month of September and until your special </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ages</span><span class="font4"> are entirely disposed of, one of these </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden, Ages</span><span class="font4"> is to be given to everyone attending these meetings. These fit in splendidly with the lectures “Way of Escape” and “Holy Year” and “Kingdom Blessings for the People”. Therefore see that everyone hearing all or part of these is supplied with a copy of this special issue, until your supply is exhausted. Do not permit anything to turn you aside from pushing this campaign as zealously as possible. The enemy is wroth with the anointed because of their devotion to Jehovah. He is going to do everything in his power to stop the work. Do not be intimidated ; go forward with implicit faith in Jehovah that this is his work, he is directing the issue, and his Captain, Christ Jesus, is leading his army, of which it is your blessed privilege to be a part, to vic</span><span class="font3">tory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>The Demeanor of the Brethren</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Remember You Are Jehovah’s witness</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">AU who participate in Jehovah’s service as his witnesses should, of course, conduct themselves as becomes a representative of the Most High God. Never forget that you are a witness of Jehovah. You are not in any way to adopt the adversary's method of force, coercion, threatening or intimidation. With calm dignity and boldness tell the people the facts. If they refuse to hear or reject the facts presented, do not force yourself or your message upon them ; walk on to the next house and present the testimony there. This is especially true in this special campaign. The truth and Jehovah’s witnesses have been woefully misrepresented to the Catholic people, through their press and clergy. Many, of them are going to be incensed against you because of their ignorance of the true facts of the case. Be patient, kind and considerate with them. Appeal to their justice. Tell them that you have not come for a controversy of any sort, that you simply wish to place the other side of the question before them and you wish to give them an opportunity to read Judge Rutherford’s answer to all those charges. Try to make them see the fairness and justice in such a course. Never get into a controversy with them. That is what the enemy wants us to do now in order to have some excuse to bring down upon the anointed the local authorities and any other destructive force he may have at his command. Do not play into his hands. Avoid such a course. If you find people who are bitter and unreasonable and do not waut the message, then calmly and quietly go on to the next house.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Keep Them Busy</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reports coming to the office from the different brethren assigned to the work of operating the portable transcription machines indicate that in a number of cases these brethren do not really appreciate what comprises the real field for this type of work. Many of them seem to figure that all they have to do is to get a machine, set it up in some little, stuffy ball, do a little bit of local advertising, and then the people will come to the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other brethren, realizing the need of forethought and planning for these campaigns, obtain splendid results. They realize that the last place In the w<sup>7</sup>orld to put one of these machines, if they want a real audience, in this weather, is in a hot, stuffy hall. They go out in the open, into the parks, camping sites, picnic grounds, by lakes where the people assemble, and in summer cottage colonies, and places such as these, where the people are and want to be. They feel at home and relax there and will gladly attend a meeting of this nature when it is arranged for at their convenience, and that is what we must do if we want success. In going after parks, if you cannot get permission from the park commissioner to use the public parks and playgrounds, don’t lie down and quit then; go to the farmer across the street, or to any one convenient who has a suitable place for an assembly; scout around. There are many places in practically every community where meetings can be held. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These meetings can be held Saturday afternoon, Saturday evening, and three or four on Sunday, if proper effort is put forth and the territory is really scouted out by competent brethren. One brother, taking advantage of such openings during the month of July, put on 26 meetings and had a total attendance of 4,937, an average of almost 190 people at each meeting. These meetings were arranged by a pioneer in isolated territory. Another brother<sup>-</sup> loaded his machine into his car and started out. He knew where there were a number of fruit pickers’ camps along the highway. He planned in advance, got permission from the superintendent, and, starting with the first one, served them in a row, making five different places each Sunday, and repeated the route every Sunday until 24 of these meetings were held; at which 227 persons took literature, besides the great number who heard and did not obtain any literature.</span></p>

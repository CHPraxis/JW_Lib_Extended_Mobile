<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">To Those Who Carry the Petition to the People</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work with the PROTEST AND PETITION should be generally along the lines outlined for the entire campaign. The first day of the divisional assembly is Saturday, and the brethren who are on hand in the morning should go out In the field with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape</span><span class="font4"> booklet, the leaflet calling attention to the petition which they will later bring back, and also the printed invitation announcing the transcription lecture, “INTOLERANCE,” to be given that evening. Beginning not later than 10 o’clock in the forenoon, and working at least until 1 o’clock, the brethren should be able to reach a sufficient number of people to keep them occupied during the late afternoon and evening. It is recommended that each of the three days the field service be with the booklet and tbe announcements from 10 o’clock In the forenoon until 1 o’clock, giving, the brethren an opportunity to get a lunch and then rest a little until 3 o’clock, by which time they may make their return calls with the PROTEST AND PETITION, until they have gone over the territory covered earlier in the day. Brethren who reach the assembly</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The early returns of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ Praise Period so clearly Indicate the Lord’s blessing upon that campaign that we cannot refrain from letting you have this brief report. When the office opened Monday morning after the first weekend 25 or more telegrams and a large number of air mail and special delivery letters were on hand ordering more </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the outstanding reasons for this phenomenal result, we believe, is tlie fact, that Brother Rutherford's recommendation of using the testimony exclusively was followed out to a greater degree than ever before. The Bethel family used the testimony exclusively, presenting the card to the people to read themselves and afterwards presenting the hook with a few brief remarks. Also the majority of the brethren in the different companies point late Saturday need not stay ont of the work because of this, but may proceed and cover as much territory during the remaining hours of the day as they can get over twice. It is believed that in no case will it be necessary to make the second call the following day during the divisional campaigns ; and this should not be done, in view of the fact that each day the workers will wish to see different people in a different territory, so that as many different ones as possible may be invited to the lecture, “INTOLERANCE,” which is to be given by electrical transcription Saturday evening, Sunday afternoon,' and Monday evening. Signers should be obtained after each of the “INTOLERANCE” lectures, from among those who heard the lecture.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> TESTIMONY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I have come to bring you a message of good cheer, and when you hear it your heart will be giad. The times are very hard and the people continue to suffer, and there is just one way of escape from even greater trouble. Jehovah God has provided that way, and it means safety and prosperity to those who learn about it and follow in it. This booklet gives a clear and plain statement of just what everyone now needs to know. You will want to be able to tell your friends and neighbors about it. Would you tike to read the booklet and contribute five cents to help get it Into the hands of others? If so you may be assured of the Lord's blessing.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Announcements for the “INTOLERANCE” lecture to be given each day will he available at the contact points. Each worker should bring his own supply of PROTEST AND PETITION papers and leaflets explaining the petition. However, fresh petitions should be used, and at the divisional campaigns the brethren should not use petitions on which are names from other territory, as such would be in another congressional district. An additional supply of PROTEST AND PETITION papers and leaflets will be on hand at the contact points. Be at the contact point early Sunday morning, 9 o’clock sharp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">served by the Bethel family during the week-ends used the testimony in this manner, with the same results. The only completed report of this period that we have at band up to the present is that of the Bethel family; so we give it to you here as a matter of comparison. During the two week-ends that it was possible for the brethren to get away from the factory and home they were able to place 1,225 bound books and 4,559 booklets.' They averaged over 6 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font4"> for each worker. This is a very definite indication of the Lord's blessing upon those who follow organization instructions. We strongly recommend tills method of using the testimony in printed form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is ready and now available a general testimony which can lie used for all the hooks and booklets. Each director, sharpshooter, piorjeer and auxiliary should order as many of these as he can judiciously use.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">You have received our letter of November 20, calling attention to the special work for the Lord’s people in obtaining signatures to the PROTEST AND PETITION and outlining the method of procedure in this campaign. There Is a tremendous amount of work for Jehovah’s witnesses to do between now ami January<sup>1</sup> 15, and they are grateful for the privilege of being enabled to put forth a special effort in defense of the name of Jehovah and the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All pioneers, auxiliaries, company ■workers, sharpshooters and those people of goo.l will who will wish to have a part in this are furnished with a supply of PROTEST AND PETITION papers and leaflets setting out the purpose of this petition. If you have not received this supply, or if you know of someone else who has not, be sure to write us at once, so that we can furnish these to you. Also, if your supply runs out. write Immediately for more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is absolutely necessary that these petitions be returned to this office not later than January 15; so all workers should see to it that they have their territory covered and get the papers in the mail in plenty of time to reach us by that date. We hope to have several million names and addresses by that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is entirely reasonable to expect that there will be nearly 25,000 individuals taking part in this campaign. Many people of good will will be glad of the opportunity to help Jehovah’s witnesses in this work. Anticipating this, we are shipping nearly 7,000,000 leaflets to the various workers. More than 150,000 PROTEST AND PETITION papers are being supplied, with room for several million signatures. It is hoped that each pioneer will secure 500 signatures, each auxiliary 250, and I he other workers 10O each. However, do not stop when all your PROTEST AND PETITION forms are filled out, but write to us for more. Each pioneer and regional service director is beiug supplied with 20 of these, 10 are being sent for each auxiliary, and 5 for each company worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren will obtain the PROTEST AND PETITION papers and the leaflets in the same manner as the radio fliers. The supply for the company workers is being shipped direct to the service director; and in the cities where there are several companies the entire allotment is being sent to the director of the English company and from him the colored and foreign-speaking companies will obtain their supply. Isolated sharpshooters are having theirs sent direct. Pioneers and auxiliaries in isolated territory are also having their supply sent to them direct. In the case of several pioneers working together, the entire allotment is being sent to one of their party, to be divided among the members of the group. In the case of pioneers aud auxiliaries who are working in company territory, the supply for these workers is being included In the shipment made to the company service director and these are to get their PROTEST AND PETITION papers and leaflets from him. Shipments are being made on the basis of 20 PROTEST AND PETITION papers to each pioneer, 10 for each auxiliary, and 5 each for the company workers. The pioneers are being allotted 1,000 of tbe leaflets, auxiliaries 500, and the coiupany workers 200, each. Distribution of the papers and leaflets should be made upon this basis, and if more are needed they will be furnished upon request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order that an effective witness may be given at the time the petition is circulated, the following arrangement should be carried out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape</span><span class="font4"> booklet is to be used during this campaign, and this together with the petition papers and leaflets are the supplies for this occasion. Sharpshooters, company workers and auxiliaries should confine their activities to this between now and January 15, and also the pioneers who are in thickly populated territory, if they can do so. Pioneers who are out in isolated rural sections may offer all of the literature to the people when they call upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most densely populated territory in your assignment should he selected for this work, in order that as many people may be seen as is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Territory covered in this campaign must be gone over twice. At the first call the worker is to present the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom </span><span class="font4">with the short testimony that is presented in the Bulletin for this. Hand to each person tbe leaflet, asking him to read it carefully, and say that you will call back later. Be sure to leave these leaflets at every residence, placing them where they are certain to be found in those cases where no one is at home.</span></p>

The folders for pioneers, auxiliaries, foreign and colored companies and sharpshooters in English company territory will be forwarded to the service director of the English company.

<p><span class="font4">Enclosed with this monthly </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> you will also find the bulletin </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Work with the Transcription Machine”.</span><span class="font4"> One of these is sent for each worker in every company and sharpshooter arrangement, as well as supplied to pioneers and auxiliaries. This should be studied carefully and taken up and discussed at a service meeting in the very near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first of this series of campaigns outlined here will be that at the divisional campaign December 30 to January 1, outline of which is contained in another part of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin.</span><span class="font4"> It was intended to concentrate on the transcription activity from that date forth, but, due to the necessity of getting the petition work completed before January 15, concentrated activity on the portable transcription machine meetings, with the exception of the divisional campaign mentioned above, will be postponed until after January 15. Then preparations can be made for the portable transcription series of meetings to commence the following week-end, January 19 and 20, and so on, as outlined in the bulletin covering that work.</span></p>

Pioneers In rural territory can have the petition signed immediately, so that no time will be lost calling back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When you call back on the people be sure to have plenty of pencils or a good fountain pen along. It will be well to have a stiff cardboard under the petition, to facilitate writing. Time spent in getting signatures should be reported as regular house-</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">All service directors, sharpshooters, pioneers, auxiliaries or other brethren sending PROTEST AND PETITION forms to the Society’s office will please see to it that the number of signers, and the name of the city or town, state and county arc neatly typewritten or printed at the bottom of each sheet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">supply immediately. These brethren should also keep in touch with the service director regarding this, so that there will be no possibility of slipping up. Every effort should be made to see that these are all distributed in the respective territories before Saturday, December 30. They should all be placed in the hands of the people before you leave for the divisional campaign on that date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Saturday, Sunday and Monday, December 30 and 31 and January 1, are to be devoted to the divisional campaign and the special work assigned for that period. Therefore we are asking the brethren throughout the country to put forth a very special effort to see that these radio folders are distributed and at the same time to try not to interfere with the petition work, which must be pushed vigorously in the allotted time. All phases of the work should</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Each portable transcription machine leader should arrange immediately to send to this office, through the local director, an order for the advertising material required for this work (pioneers and auxiliaries and sharpshooters will order direct). Leaflets for free distribution, aniiouncing the respective talks, are now ready and may he ordered immediately, as well as the window cards and placards for the automobiles. Get placards for every car that is available for advertising these meetings, and plenty of window cards to cover your territory. These are to be used as instructed, and, of course, will be used again a number of times, simply changing the title of the lecture as the occasion demands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let this work be undertaken with enthusiasm and zeal. Press the campaign vigorously. The Lord has very evidently opened up this means of witnessing and has brought it to the front just at the time when the enemies are using all their power to have pie lectures taken off the radio. Probably the Lord wants it this way, for these transcription machine meetings make the Kingdom message available to thousands of people who have no radios and have no prospects of getting one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">to-house witness work. Some other books and booklets should be taken along for those especially interested, and a few might be placed on this second call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the brethren will, of course, be anxious to sign this petition themselves, and the matter should be brought to the attention of all those who attend the various transcription meetings held during this period. Doubtless many signers can be obtained on such occasions.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">be so arranged as not to conflict unnecessarily with the other features. The radio folders, therefore, should be distributed hy the workers when they go back for the signatures to the petition. The reason for this is to avoid leaving too much reading matter on the first time around. If you leave the radio folder and petition announcement many people will overlook reading one or may read neither one of them, due to the fact that there is too much reading material left. Therefore, to avoid this, distribute the petition announcements at the time you go around with your </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Escape</span><span class="font4"> booklet, and when you return in the evening for the signatures leave the radio folder, with an invitation to be sure to listen in to the talk.' If at the last minute you find that you cannot dispose of all your radio folders in this manner, make some special effort to get the remainder out and in the hands of the people by Friday night, December 29.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Funerals</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are numerous requests coming to the office for a uniform funeral service. The claim is made that some of the local brethren do not give an effective witness or else deal with material that is not exactly appropriate for the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The question has been asked, “Would it be proper to use transcription recordings for such occasions ?” We recommend, first, “'Where Are the Dead?” to be followed by the record on “Funerals”. These two records would make an excellent presentation of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In view of the fact that there are transcription machines available in all parts of the country now, with the prospects of a great many more in tlie near future, we believe that this would be a very desirable way to conduct funeral services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The only object that the Lord’s people could possibly have in serving at a funeral is to give a witness to the name and purposes of Jehovah. At the close of the service appropriate prayer could be offered by some competent brother.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The stirring speech on “RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE” delivered by Brother Rutherford at Plainfield, N. .1., before machine guns and a house full of strong-armed “Ethiopians&quot; with glistening revolvers, is to be broadcast throughout the country on Sunday, December 31. There are hundreds of radio stations and portable transcription machines going to carry this very important lecture on that date. This message is the most pointed and clear-cut declaration of the Lord against the institutions of Satan, particularly the Catholic hierarchy, delivered up to that time. We believe that this will make a tremendous impression throughout the country and be very instrumental in causing mauy to don their garments, manifesting where they stand tn the great issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">AH of the brethren who can possibly do so should arrange to assemble with their division on that occasion, for in addition to having a part in putting this lecture across and doing house-to-house witnessing, there is another special event to take place which will not be an</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is hoped that EVERY service director, sharpshooter, pioneer and auxiliary will promptly send in a report of the field witness work done during the ENTIRE month of November, INCLUDING the special period results of November 18-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the very regrettable features of the October report was the failure on the part of many sharpshooters, in particular, to send in complete reports for October. Many of them failed altogether to include the special period results in the month’s report, while many others failed to make out their month’s report completely in one way or another. We do hope the November report will show a decided improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We hope to receive PROMPT and COMPLETE reports both for the special period of November 18-26 and for the ENTIRE month of November. Your cooperation will save time and money.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Microphone Attachments for Transcription Machines</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The question has come into this office from many who have portable transcription machines as to whether it is proper for them to use a microphone attachment, and they desire to have the Society's permission before going ahead with it. As far as the Society is concerned, anyone having a transcription machine and desiring a microphone attachment may correspond direct with Sound Systems, Inc., 113 Terminal Tower, Cleveland, Ohio, and make all arrangements with them. They will supply you with a letter setting out the information as to price and how the connection is to be made. In parks and large auditoriums a microphone attachment is helpful. Please do not write to the Society concerning this. The reason for this statement is to inform all having transcription machines that if they wish to have microphone attachments it is perfectly all right with the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">nounced u u t i 1 9 o’clock Sunday morning at the divisional campaign headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. Special folders for the advertising of this lecture at the divisional campaigns are prepared and will be entirely different from the folders used for the radio announcements. Therefore do not bring any radio folders to the campaign. Be sure they are all distributed in your own territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The method of distributing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">P. T.</span><span class="font4"> Jlf. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">folders,</span><span class="font4"> petition announcements and booklets at the divisional campaign is going to be different from that carried on with the distribution of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">radio announcements.</span><span class="font4"> At the divisional campaign the petition announcements, transcription machine folders and the booklets are to be presented at the same time, because if the transcription announcements are not left the first time around many of the people whom you cull on when you return for signers to the petition would not have time to make arrangements to attend the transcription meeting in the evening. It should be emphasized, therefore, when leaving the petition announcements and P. T. M. folders, that it is very important that hotlx. of these should be read.</span></p>

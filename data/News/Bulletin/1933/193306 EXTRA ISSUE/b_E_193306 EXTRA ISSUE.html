<p><span class="font12">Ambassadors’ Devotional Period, July 1 to 9</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark1"></a>The Name of JEHOVAH Is a Strong Tower</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Into Which the Righteous Flee</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only is it the privilege of the anointed to enjoy this blessed security at this time, but they are additionally privileged to extend their hand to Jonadab, which, in symbol, says, “I will use my power for you arid give you aid.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This aid was very materially manifested in The Remnant's Thanksgiving Period. It is (he great privilege of the anointed to point out to others the great necessity of now taking a bold stand on the side of the Lord. Those who would be faithful to Cod cannot now hold themselves in secret and not disclose themselves about God’s organization and their part in it. The time has come when everyone of the remnant must clearly tie identified as on the Lord’s side. There is no compromise; their declaration must be for God and his Christ and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period in the United States alone there was an increase of more than 7,000 workers over any former campaign, with corresponding increases shown by the other countries that have already reported. This is a clear indicaiion that the Jonadab class are hearing the message and joyfully taking their stand with Jehu on the side of Jehovah. This brings great joy to the truly anointed because it is a direct fulfilment of the prophetic word of Jehovah and also enables them to see that they are having some little part in helping others to taste of the great joy that can come only from serving in harmony with the Lord’s arrangement. This privilege of assisting the Jonadab class is going to increase, according to the Scriptures. It is not a mutter of simply helping them once or twice a year on the occasion of these special campaigns, but it is the great privilege of the lord’s people to do this regularly and continually. Company workers, pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters, all of the anointed, should watch for this privilege and assist ail who are anxious to have any part in the Lord's service at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Attempted Interference</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to evidence communicated to tills office, the sons of Satan are heing stirred up to attempt to throttle broadcasting of the good news of the kingdom of Jehovah</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Almost Everyone Will Be Able to Put in 5 Full Days</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">by means of the electrical transcription programs at some points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is requested that every one concerned in the presentation of this program be advised, in this connection, that full and uninterrupted service, according to contract, is expected of each radio station that has been engaged. Any attempt to interfere with or interrupt the service, maliciously or otherwise, please report promptly to this office, radio department, giving all particulars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Devotional Period Service Leaders</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family Will Enjoy 4 Full Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In keeping with the usual policy, Brother Rutherford hag arranged for the brethren working in the factory, office and Bethel home to have all day Saturday, July 1 and 8, off from their regular duties in order to enable them to have Saturday and Sunday at Hie beginning and at the end of the Ambassadors’ Devotional Period for field service and also to serve companies as field service leaders within a radius of 200 miles from New York. Therefore, if your company is within .the above area and you desire a service leader for either the opening or the closing period of this campaign, write nt once to the service department, making your request and stating specifically the dates on which you wish the brother to serve you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Needles for the Portable Transcription Machine</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been found that it is impractical to use two different kinds of needle on the Portable Transcription Machines, due to the fact that it has to be changed after each record. Once the RCA needle is removed from the pick-up it can never be used again without defacing the record. Therefore the following arrangement is recommended as the most effective and economical. USE ONLY COLUMBIA NEEDLES KOR LONG-PLAYING RECORDS, both for music and for Brother Rutherford’s transcriptions, but BE SURE </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">TO</span><span class="font4"> CHANGE THE NEEDLE •fcER EACH RECORD. These ueecRes will play only ONE record; throw them away after using once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These needles not only play Brother Rutherford’s records well, but also play the music records witli a. softer, mellower and more pleasing tone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Time in the Field Will Bear Much Fruit</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Books and Booklets to Be Offered</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">July 1-9 is another period set aside by the remnant for worshiping Jehovah. This period is to be called “Ambassadors’ Devotional Period”. Paul said; in 2 Corinthians 5:20: “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ”; or, according to tlie </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dia.glott:</span><span class="font4"> 'On behalf of the Anointed, therefore, wc arc ambassadors.' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The May 15 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> says, in part: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Jehovah put his words in the mouth of Christ Jesus the Great Prophet, and that Great Prophet has instructed and enlightened those who are of the anointed class, . . . Jehovah committed his testimony to Christ Jesus and clothed him with all power and authority; heuee it is written that it is ‘The testimonj' of Jesus Christ’. He did not receive that testimony from man, but from his Father. Christ Jesus is the elect servant of Jehovah ; and the faithful remnant on earth, being members of his body, are ‘the feet of him’ to whom the testimony of Jesus Christ is committed. As members of the body of Christ the remnant are under the direct command of Christ Jesus, the Head, and must render to him complete obedience. ... A failure or refusal to deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ would be unfaithfulness on the part of any member of the remnant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How appropriate, then, it is that the remnant should be called “ambassadors for Christ” 1 As ambassadors for Christ they show their devotion to God by obeying hig commandments. It will be a busy time for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hie season itself is particularly fitted for giving more time to the witness work. With two Saturdays ami two Sundays, and a national holiday in the United States on July -1, the ambassadors for Christ will have considerable time off from their usual employment. Holidays are especially good for witnessing, because then the men are at home from office and factory and the farmers are in from the fields. During prosperous times many people go pleasure-seeking on such occasions. Now they stay at home and have time to listen to the message brought to them by the ambassadors of the Anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two special combination offers are to be presented during this period, In communities where the people are not too poor, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font4">1, 2 and 3 and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font4"> should be offered when one contributes $1.00 toward the work. If this combination is not placed, then drop to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font4"> and six booklets when a contribution of 50c is given. In communities where the people are not so well oft financially the ‘Pres</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ervation</span><span class="font4"> and six booklets' combination should be presented first. In each booklet combination placed there should be Included a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis </span><span class="font4">booklet, and, in fact, it should be offered singly at every home where the other literature is not taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since this will be the first and only service period during the summer, special effort should be made to get out Into the rural sections. If possible, a survey of the territory-should be made in advance fay the directors, and the workers advised as to the more suitable of the two combi nations to obtain the best results. In working rurals at this time of the year it should be possible to take farm produce as contributions for the literature. It would be well, therefore, at a service meeting preceding the period, for the matter of the disposal of such produce to be considered. If the brethren know that they will have little difficulty in getting rid of that which they receive they will then know what produce to suggest in instances where the people have no money. If a section is to be worked where some particular produce is a specialty with tlie farmers, the service director should investigate the local markets to see if any surplus over and above the personal demands of the workers can be sold. If a favorable arrangement can be made with a local merchant, then the workers can be informed concerning it and lie advised as to the am out) I, at which such contributions are to be figured so that when they are sold the workers will not be the losers. Knowledge of such an arrangement would be a help to pioneers working in the vicinity, also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The territory should be well mapped out and the workers thoroughly instructed where to go and how- to get there to avoid all waste of time. Parties should be arranged for working the rural sections so as to keep the workers busy. If the two-car system is used, all workers should cooperate by making their testimonies brief and to the point, (Continued on page 2, column 4)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Booklet Greatly Appreciated </span><span class="font4">It is still too early to give you the international report on the resuits of The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period, since not all the reports from the different countries have yet been received. We do have the final figures for this country, however, and they will be sure to make you very happy. Never before has there been such a response to a call to service ns during this special period. During the same period last year 13,628 participated in the work. This year reports have been received from 20,902, or an increase of 7,274 workers. Where did all of these come from? Well, it does look as if some of the Jonadab class arc getting into the chariot, doesn’t it? As a matter of fact, several letters have been received stating that the increase in number of workers was due to some of this class’ participating in the work for the first time. With such a big increase in number of workers engaging in the service for the first time, we might expect the general averages of time and placements to be considerably less; but just look at the following results:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the nine days 886,592 books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people. Pioneers, auxiliaries, company workers and sharpshooters specialized on the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booklet, according to instructions, and only here and there, when an especially interested party was found, was the other literature presented. Titis is evident from the fact that of this remarkable total only 6,932 were books. The balance of 879,660 were booklets. That you might better appreciate what this means, we give you a comparison with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> witness week during the ten days of September 1931, when the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet was offered. At that time 732,852 books and booklets were placed, by 13,613 workers. During these ten days these workers averaged 13.8 hours per worker in the field, whereas during The Remnant’s Thanksgiving Period the 20,902 averaged 13.7 hours. With one day less time, poorer weather conditions, and many new workers who never before went out in the work, to have only .1 of an hour less per worker is worthy of special note. Certainly it shows that the Lord’s time has come for the message to be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In placing this year's 886,592 pieces of literature, 2,229,880 testimonies were given. This represented over st million more testimonies than during the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> Wiiness Period, at which time 1,162,236 testimonies</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meeting to Be Advertised by Placards</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Your Machine in Use</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As conditions throughout the earth get worse, it is evident that all human institutions are forsaking (he poor and needy. Their distress and misery increase. However, the Lord is not unmindful of their condition, mid has graciously increased his provisions to supply them with a knowledge of his purposes that they might have hope and joy. Throughout the country there arc a large number of portable transcription i machines owned by companies, divisions, pioneers, auxiliaries, sharpshooters and quite a number of Jonadabs who are using them in-their places of business to proclaim the purposes of the Lord by using Brother Rutherford's transcription records. AH of the regional service directors who travel by automobile are also supplied with one of these machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has very evidently opened up this field to increase the witness work, particularly among the poor and needy and in sections where there are no radio stations carrying Brother Rutherford's lectures. Therefore everyone having one of these machines should be using it regularly to the.praise of Jehovah. At least two evenings a week and one or two meetings each Sunday should be arranged. Advertising cards and instructions for planning and putting on these meetings are now prepared and a copy is enclosed with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> to the companies and sharpshooters, and I one will also be supplied to everyone owning and operating a portable transcription machine whose address wo have. Brethren who have their own machine and are using it to broadcast Brother Rutherford’s lectures and who do not get a copy of these instructions will please write this office for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time has come when the anointed of the I,ord must raise the voice in unity and sing the song of pra ise to Jehovah in harmony. Therefore it is very necessary that all</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">cooperate in putting on these meetings uniformly. During the visits of the regional service directors with in the work and placed 140.04 booklets each, 867 auxiliaries reported an average of 26.39 hours and 81.12 booklets, and the 18,204 company workers and sharpshooters averaged 10.3 hours and 30,3 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Surely there is every cause for rejoicing in the way the Lord blessed the efforts put forth in all parts of the country. We can look forward with anticipation to the final worldwide results. As soon as we get them completed we will pass them on to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">portable transcription machine, arrangements should be made to hold one or more public meetings; these meetings to be advertised and arranged for as suggested in the instructions mentioned above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This, however, is not. intended to mean that brethren should stay out of the field service in order to attend those meetings. Most of the portable transcription machine meetings should be scheduled for evening or late in the afternoon, after the majority of the workers have returned from the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Saturday and Sunday should, as fur as possible, be used for opening up new territory. Therefore the follow-up meetings should be held during the week. To illustrate: A party working in a territory on Saturday and Sunday can properly advertise the meeting and invite the people to the port able transcription meeting to be held either Saturday evening or Sunday afternoon. At this meeting rhe chairman is supposed to make arrangements for subsequent meetings. These subsequent meetings should, ns fur ns possible, be scheduled for some evening during the week, thus leaving Saturday and Sunday open for entering into new territory and preparing for other meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time is now here to extend the Kingdom witness as far as possible. Let everyone be on the alert to take advantage of the privileges that are. opening up. Every worker in the field should be watchful to see what opportunities there are in his particular territory for putting on one or more of these meetings and should cooperate with the service director in scheduling them. In territory where companies or sharpshooters have no portable I rimscription machine but feel that there is an opening in their territory to use one, please advise this office'promptly and every effort will be made to route a pioneer, regional service director or some other competent brother to put on a series of meetings in your territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The New Zealand Radio Board, in tluenced by the Devil’s clergy, refuse to allow the people to hear the Kingdom message over the air. . Jehovah’s witnesses in New Zealand, however, are making an extra effort to tell the people why their rulers will not permit them to hear the truth. By means of a monster petition and letters to the public* press, every effort is being made to give them this information. At the Wellington assembly, held recently, there were seven liappy days spent in this work. “Locusts” swarmed on the streets, at the church doors, and called on the people at their homes. The rulers anil principal people were visited. Policemen discussed with one another as to whether the street work should be permitted, but the work was completed without Interference. A filling climax to the assembly was Ilie public meeting held in one of the large theaters. Here the people were invited to hear for themselves the lectures considered by the Radio Board too controversial to be heard over the air. Judging by the applause, the people were entirely out of sympathy with the decision of the Radio Board.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">AMBASSADORS’ CALL TO ACTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Field to Be Wonderfully Prepared for Service Period</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>The Name of JEHOVAH Is a Strong Tower</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">To </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Those Who Are on His Side</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Meetings with Transcription Machines to Instruct Many</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During these perilous times it is of vital Importance to let the people know that there is only one place of security. Some are beginning to realize that the organizations of the world offer no real protection ' against the great day which is at hand. They are asking, “What is ■ the way of escape? How may I receive protection during the impending conflict?” The name of Jehovah is a strong tower, and the righteous flee into it. Not only do the righteous rejoice to take their stand on the side of Jehovah, but it is their keenest delight to notify the people concerning Jehovah’s purposes and how they too may find the way of escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Rutherford's special broadcasts last April directed many people to an investigation of the literature containing the Kingdom message. These speeches now prepared for electrical transcription will do much more to break down the prejudice aroused through ignorance, but, with the financial stress growing more and more severe, many are unable to hear the radio lectures because of having to give up their radio sets. Here, then, is where the portable transcription machines provided by the Lord will meet the emergency which has arisen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been a hesitancy on the part of some to get one of these machines, thinking that they cannot afford to rent halls and spend the money for extensive advertising. The expenditure of a lot of time and money Should not be necessary. In working your territory, if yon find some interested parties, suggest their meeting together in one of the homes, take out your transcription machine, and hold a meeting, having the neighbors invited to come in and listen.. If you are working a rnral section, the conn try schoolhouse can often be obtained free of charge. When in session ask the .teacher to tell the pnpils to inform their parents concerning the meeting, and put up a placard in a conspicuous pl ace in front of the school, so that passers-by will noticeit. Fraternal lodges, abandoned churches, town halls and courthouses can often be had free of charge</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Over 150 Stations to Broadcast Special Transcription Prog.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">in small towns. One brother suggested the courthouse lawn, where <sup>:</sup> most of the people in the small . towns assemble. If you Can obtain permission to use ft, do so. Many small towns have so few things to distract the attention of the people that such a central place outside would probably result in many listeners. Public parks, picnic grounds, public beaches, and summer resorts during the warm weather offer excellent places for outdoor meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tourist camps also'should not be overlooked. It may be necessary to obtain permission to hold your meeting on their property; but if it is not granted, try the farmer across the road or a near-by service station or “hot dog” stand. Then invite .the campers to attend the broadcast. Many of these camps are located on the outskirts of towns where there is nothing for the people to do during the evening before retiring. Many will be glad to have some such diversion, and will receive a great blessing thereby. These camps, being inhabited by a continually changing population, can be used repeatedly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is hot to be expected that such meetings will be attended by great numbers, but if the machines are to be used effectively, they should be used frequently. Extensive preparations need not be made, but if one is on the alert, places his placards announcing the meetings in conspicuous places, and then drives around town in his car broadcasting a musical record to attract attention to a big placard on his car advertising the meeting, interest can be aroused. Where sufficient interest is shown a series of meetings should be held to further develop the interest.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Radio Drama over WBBR</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The drama “Defying Jehovah”, which is an actual reproduction of the trial of our brethren at Summit, N. J., recently, will be broadcast from the studios of WBBR on Sunday morning, June 18, between six and seven o’clock, Eastern Daylight Saving Time, for the benefit of the brethren throughout the United States and Canada who are able to get our station. We would appreciate a card commenting on the presentation and advising how the program was received.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">First, “The Way of Escape,” on Sunday, June 18; second, “Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity,” on Sunday, June 25; third, “Kingdom Blessings for the People,” on Sunday, July 2; AND THEN AMBASSADORS’ DEVOTIONAL PEIIIOD, JULY 1 to 9!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These three lectures by Brother Rutherford, which so thrilled multitudes when heard over a chain of from 60 to 60 stations last April, are to be heard over more than 150 stations on the dates mentioned, in every part of the United States. This is possible because the transcription records made of each of these stirring lectures are now ready and special arrangements have been made with all these radio stations to broadcast them in their entirety. Each lecture is approximately </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">45 </span><span class="font4">minutes long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lectures will be advertised by the distribution of 5,000,000 radio announcements, which are being shipped to companies, sharpshooters, isolated pioneers and isolated auxiliaries. Head elsewhere in this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font4"> for further information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And then immediately following this mighty harrage, in fact, even while the last lecture is being broadcast, the singers of the Lord’s army will move into action armed with the literature. Never have such extensive preparations been made to arouse the interest of the people preliminary to a service period ; never was there </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> more favorable time for announcing the only hope for mankind; never should Jehovah’s witnesses be more on the alert to take full advantage of this wonderful opportunity than during Ambassadors’ Devotional Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time for action is here and the Lord is providing his people with plenty of opportunity.' Times continue to grow in severity; lond is the talk of “Peace, peace”, but human efforts for peace continue to fail. Jehovah’s witnesses, to whom has been committed the testimony of Jesus Christ, are called upon to hasten bringing this testimony to the people because the time rapidly approaches for the complete vindication of Jehovah’s word and name. Those who love Jehovah cm. will not delay. With that culiarto the Lord's house they will respond to this call to a determined to .take advantage r.a three great broadcasts and thei wide publicity which will have prepared the people to receive Jehovah's witnesses.</span></p>

Never was a time more opportune for getting started in the witness work than it will be during Ambassadors’ Devotional Period following these three big broadcasts. ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The most pointed messages to date against the Devil’s organization, and for the comfort and encouragement of those relying upon the Lord are the ones contained in the recent chain network speeches “The Way '&quot;’. Escape”, &quot;Effect of Holy Year” &quot;Kingdom Blessings for the There are millions of peb-'ghout the country who did these messages over the he sure that this message dthin the reach of every dng a radio set, the Lord iged for a rebroadcast of eehes over a national com-of radio stations by eleetri-'scrlption. The entire eoun-,m the Atlantic to the Pacific :om the Great Lakes to the of Mexico, will be blanketed </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">j</span><span class="font4"> these stations strategically located for the very best results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This great campaign will begin Sunday, June 18, with “The Way of Escape”, and be followed on June 25 with “Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity” and on July 2 wP “ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' Bies'sings for the Peo</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ple . ,.rc some of the ‘whatsoever things the Lord has provided’ for giving the testimony. Doesn't it thrill your heart to have some little part in this mighty campaign, directed by the King of eternity through his anointed King?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, to put these talks on the ,s only one step in this cam-they will be of no benefit to ho do not listen. Therefore 1 have to be advertised, and 'he ‘whatsoever things Jeho-h’ides’ for .this purpose are special radio folders show-itions and time of broad-e will have to be placed ands of the people. How? Icing some other branch of such as the field work? </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">j</span><span class="font4"> not; but by each one’s put-forth the additional effort required for this work. Daylight saving time provides long evenings of daylight in many sections of the country, and even in sections where they do not have daylight saving the brethren have two or more hours of daylight, after they get through their daily work. This time should be utilized for the distribution of these folders, as well as handing them out during the regular witness</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">-k. In addition to this there are thousands of Jonadabs who <sup>+</sup>imid yet to do regular door-dtnessing. These should be td to have part in this disin. fact, every possible uld be used to distribute tio folders as soon as pos-<sub>:</sub>r you receive them. Noth-thls is to be construed as ng an indiscriminate and 3 distribution of the radio j. In all eases ring the door and band folder to the party .spending; and in cases where no one is at home, see that the folder is placed in a conspicuous place where it will be seen and taken</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Broadcasts</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">when the people return. Do not throw it on the porch or put it in the letter box. And remember, delay is dangerous: each lecture that is broadcast before the folders are distributed diminishes the effect of your work one-third. Therefore, if humanly possible without interfering with other branches of the service, get all your folders disposed of by June 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If when you receive your radio folders you find that the station or stations in your vicinity are not included in the list appearing thereon, it is due to the fact that the information regarding your station was received in this office too late to be included in that list. Therefore obtain a small rubber stamp showing the city, station call letters and the time that it is on the air, and stamp it on the margin of the folders. There will be plenty of room on this folder for you to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another of the ‘whatsoever things the Lord provides’ is window cards. These are supplied only to brethren owning portable transcription machines, and will not be provided for any other purpose. These are arranged with a space in the center for the date and place of meeting, in the case of portable transcription meetings. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Do not write in this space, </span><span class="font4">but take a sheet of white paper cut wide enough to fit the space and neatly print the information upon it and then paste it in the space provided. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">When using these window cards for advertising the special broadcasts,</span><span class="font4"> cut the white band of paper sufficiently wide to cover the last two lines on the card (for the expressions “Bring your family and friends” and “Free” would not apply to a radio broadcast) and on this white sheet neatly print the title of the speech, the date and time of broadcast, and the radio station or stations in your vicinity carrying the lecture. If these cards are thus prepared and judiciously distributed in store windows they will have a good effect. Remember to have it definitely understood that these cards are not to be destroyed. Tell the store people you will be back to change the subject for each of these special broadcasts and to collect the cards when the series are finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These cards are to be similarly used when advertising your portable transcription meetings. On such occasions you will </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not-</span><span class="font4"> cover up the two bottom lines, of course, and your strip of paper to be pasted on the space provided will contain the date, time and location of the meeting place. When the meetings move to some other section, the window cards are to be collected and reused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These broadcasts have been timed so as not to interfere with the Ambassadors’ Devotional Period, while at the same time they prepare the way before the workers. The last of the three special speeches comes on the first Sunday of the campaign. Thus all radio folders and advertising are entirely removed from the special period, except, of course, the regular radio folders, which will be left as usual during that period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These special speeches will be approximately three times as long as the regular weekly transcription. Therefore, as far as possible, these talks are arranged so as to commence at the regular time and include the regular fifteen-minute period and a half hour additional to accommodate the three-record speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Smite Thine Hands Together”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Microphone announcements were used last April at a large number of stations not included in the special chains. This publicity was very effective, together with distribution of radio folders, newspaper notices, &quot;sandwich” boards, posters on automobiles and trucks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Similar announccment-copy is now ready for giving most intensive microphone publicity for the transcription rebroadcasts of the chain talks mentioned elsewhere in this issue. Besides the 150 and more stations selected to rebroadcast these talks, there are hundreds of other stations in the United States which can be utilized by Jehovah’s witnesses in each locality to direct listeners’ attention to these special broadcasts. For convenience of the brethren, we are mailing two sets of announcements for such use to all points at which (or near which) one or more radio stations are situated, together with a letter of instruction regarding use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">JEHOVAH instructs the “son of man” company' (Ezekiel 21:14) to “prophesy, and smite thine hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain; it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which en-tereth into their privy chambers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ADVANCE PUBLICITY is an essential part of this special campaign. As one claps (“smite thine hands together”) to attract attention, so it is now the privilege and duty of Jehovah’s witnesses to use every agency at their disposal to stir and attract all possible attention to the ‘prophesying’ being done in obedience to His command. “Let the proclamation of the message of the day of the vengeance of our God continue </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">with emphasis</span><span class="font4"> until it is complete. Repeatedly call the attention of the people thereto.”— </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> Book One, page 279.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Hold Chain Records Pending Instructions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The live disks, containing the special chain speeches and another fifteen-minute program to be put on on July 9, are to be kept by the radio representative until he receives instructions regarding their further use. Under no circumstances are they to be used on the portable transcription machines without specific instructions to do so from this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Report for</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">July 1 to 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">EVERY service director, sharpshooter, pioneer and auxiliary is to make out a report card covering the field witness activities during the Ambassadors’ Devotional Period. This report is to be made out on one of the regular monthly report cards, and this card is to be headed by you, “Ambassadors’ Devotional Period, July 1.-9.” This special report is to be sent in to the Society by July 16 at the very latest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This will mean , that during July TWO report cards will be made out. One report card will be for the Ambassadors’ Devotional Period, and another report card for the ENTIRE month of July (from July 1 to 31) ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I thus including in your July report the special period results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Shipment of the Special Radio Folders</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the companies, sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries throughout the United States will receive a consignment of .these special radio folders, free of charge. These folders are being shipped ONLY to the English service directors and sharpshooters and to the isolated pioneers and auxiliaries. Foreign-speaking and Colored companies and sharpshooters, pioneers and auxiliaries located within company territory are to arrange to obtain through the English service director or sharpshooter the quantity of folders they can dispose of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a general rule, the size of the consignment sent will be such as will enable the brethren to dispose of these folders within ten days of their arrival. To accomplish this quick disposal, in company and sharpshooter territory especially, service directors and sharpshooters must immediately notify the different brethren in their territory of the receipt of the folders. Every effort must then be made to get the folders in the hands of the brethren quickly, that they, in turn, may speedily distribute them to the people (without interrupting the field service work, of course) ; thus enabling as many people as possible to tune in on all three of the lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society will start printing these folders June 5. On that same day, or on the next day at the latest, the shipping of consignments will begin. We expect to be able to print and ship out all the radio folders by June 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Do with Old Transcription Machine Records</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Not to Be Used for Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the brethren having port-tble transcription machines are writing in to the transcription department saying that they have already used the supply of records sent, and asking for more records, and also asking what to do with the ones now on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The original intention was to rotate these records in quantities of six each, and once a month, beginning about July first. However, Brother Rutherford has approved another arrangement, which will operate during July( August and September, so that the rotating will be postponed until about November first. You will receive full instructions on this later, and will also receive notice when to rotate and what numbers you are to ship, and the numbers you will receive, at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The supply of records which you now have can be repeated every three or more weeks until the new campaign begins; and if possible to hold meetings in different localities, they can be used Indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do not under any circumstances use for radio purposes the records scut you for portable transcription machines, and do not loan them or ship them to other parties without written instructions from the transcription department. So please hold and use the records you now have on hand until you </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">get further instructions</span><span class="font4"> from the office.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">A study of September activities will undoubtedly bring joy to everyone who had any part in them, Over two million pieces of literature were placed during the month. This is the most remarkable record we have had to date, and is a clear indication of (he Lord’s blessing upon the special campaign with the booklets and Golden </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Age</span><span class="font3"> among the Catholic people. We could not begin to recount the many wonderful experiences reported by the workers regarding the reception they received from Catholic people who are beginning to appreciate that the matter as presented to them in the Catholic press was not true to facts. We feel confident that everyone, as they go over these figures and examine them, will, like us, get a great thrill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The September figures indicating the effectiveness of the old-booklet campaign are clear evidence that this was very effective in the territory that was covered. There is a great deal of territory, some held by practically every company, sharpshooter ineluding the risen saints and his host of holy angels, follow after him, riding righteous war mounts and marching on to victory. (Rev. 19:11-14) On earth are the remnant in evidence, and these are the only ones really seen by the enemy; and these are singing aloud the praises of the victorious Warrior whose name is now to he vindicated. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Over </span><span class="font3">and above his entire militant organization is the great Jehovah </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God, </span><span class="font3">the mighty Warrior, who knows no defeat and who is directing the operation of his army.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let all who have been lifted up far above the sad conditions of this world and who see the. incontrovertible proof that the time of deliverance is at hand manifest their appreciation and love by joining in the ranks of this victorious army and go forth with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font3"> which discloses to all Jehovah's provision for the preservation of those who love him io the battle of the great day of God Almighty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">November 18-26 is &quot;Jehovah's Witnesses’ Praise Period&quot;; and what an occasion for praise 1 Looking back over the past year and seeing the Lord's leadings in every branch of the work in which we have been privileged (o pnrl.ieipat.c is great cause for praise. The last few months have witnessed the most desperate attempt on the part of the enemy to stop the work in this country; but, despite all their efforts, Brother Rutherford has been enabled, by the Lord's grace, to put on, on three consecutive Sundays, three of the largest chain broadcasts we have ever had. The month of September has witnessed the widest distribution of the Kingdom message, by means of the booklets and special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden- Age</span><span class="font3"> No. 3113, that has ever taken place 5n any one month, and on top of these was the world-wide campaign with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet, which early </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font3">ports indicate was a phenomenal success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These thrilling facts clearly reveal to the anointed the supremacy of our God and the onward victorious mnreli of the Kingdom. And now, as a grand climax of the year, Jehovah bus provided us with. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span><span class="font3"> with its panoramic view of the preparation, the battle, and the aflermal.h; truths vital to the existence of the anointed and to the existence of every creature who hopes </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">have the Lord’s protection in the battle of the great day of God Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wilh such evidences of the Lord’s favor and blessing, who could withhold praising his name? Praise, however, is not a matter of lip service only. In fact, words are the least effective method of praising the Lord. The apostle tells us that “faith without works is dead”. The same may he said of praise. Our thankfulness and gratitude to Jehovah are best expressed in diligent service. During Jehovah’s Witnesses’ Praise Period we are afforded another opportunity to show forth our love and faith in Jehovah and his kingdom in a very special way. Therefore let us arrange now to sot aside every possible moment for field service during that period. The Scriptures indicate that the time is short. We must work speedily. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font3"> we have the most important message ever committed to the anointed to deliver. The message that book coutaius must be delivered before Armageddon because it is a message of preparation for Armageddon. Not only is this message for the anointed, but it is also for the honest-hearted people of the world whom we call Jonadabs and for the &quot;prisoner” class: The only way this message is to be delivered to these classes is by going from house to house, knocking at the door and telling them about it. Thus we place within their reach the message of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font3"> which, if taken advantage of, will enable them to meet the great crisis on the Lord’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Work city and town territory during this campaign. Leave rural territory until afterwards. The directors should arrange to have back calls made </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font3">those who manifested exceptional interest when presented with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Escape</span><span class="font3"> booklet. This work should he done in the evening. During the daytime the regular campaign activity should be pushed strenuously. Let everyone have a part in this work. To the .Iormdubs who have been blessed with a knowledge of Jehovah’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">pur</span><span class="font3">poses undoubtedly the words of the apostle Paul to the anointed will strongly appeal: &quot;Blessed be God, oven the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who com-forteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort, them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God,&quot; and a great many of them will want to express their love and appreciation to Jehovah by having a part in this special praise period. Service directors will therefore make preparations to assist till of these good people into the service; likewise sharpshooters, auxiliaries and pioneers, Tn fact, the Lord’s anointed everywhere should put forth every effort to assist these good people in rendering their heart devotion unto Jehovah. A large number of Jonadabs have been participating in the service campaigns and special witnessing work during the last few months. This leads us to believe that we shall have approximately </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">20,000 </span><span class="font3">workers in the field during Jehovah's Witnesses’ Praise Period. We believe that a conservative quota will </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be 4 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font3"> books for each (Continued on page 2, column 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has greatly blessed the efforts of his people to faithfully use this additioual instrument that the Lord Jins provided, as is shown by the splendid reports being received from the field. The work with the trunscripliou machine is gaining impetus as the brethren grow more proficient in conducting the meetings, and to date there lias been an audience of a quarter of a million, with an average attendance of 52. A great number of very enthusiastic letters have been received from the brethren using these machines in the work of the various divisions, companies, pioneers, auxiliaries and sharpshooters, and we believe that not only will what they have written us bo very interesting to all, but many of the suggestions will be valuable to others who are putting on the transcription meetings.</span></p>

That afternoon we always have to quit working in the rurals because we find nobody home. Now we get them all together in town, and they listen, too.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">From Missouri a pioneer writes: “Wc surely appreciate the privilege of using the transcription machine. It is such a joy to see some of these farmers, who never heard a lecture over the radio or even saw a train, drink in the truth, eager for every word. We have found it good to put on lectures on Saturday p.m,, as so many farmers come into town for supplies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Excellent results have been obtained by an eastern division, reporting 103 programs for the month, with an audience of 9,500. In making his report the one in charge of the machine states; “We put on an average of three programs an evening throughout the week. We are able to put on a program in an hour, which includes setting up the machine, running the records, and moving to the next point. The program consists of three 13-ininute records and two 6-minute musical numbers, making a 4,8-uiinute program and allowing 12 minutes to move to the next point. The machine is set up inside of a small house trailer, We place the speaker on the roof during the program. People who are interested in seeing a small home on wheels come to see the trailer mid also listen to the lecture. We carry banners on both sides of the trailer, announcing Judge Rutherford's lectures. We found this an excellent means of advertising. We have 300 feel of wire to connect the trailer with the various homes, parks and other popular places where we set up the machine. The various places we have used are public parks, bathing beaches, county homes, sailors' homes, picnic grounds, tourist camps, and private homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Wc had the machine placed in a small village one evening and a farmer heard the program J.J miles away. He got in his car and drove down to the village to see what it was. We repeat the use of the urnchine at the same place and time every month and find It very successful. We secured a permit for 25c. Where </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font3"> cannot </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font3">placed, then drop to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet and endeavor to leave </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font3">In every home with those who contribute 5c. The indications arc that this is going to be the biggest bound-book campaign we have had in years. There is no question in the mind of any of the anointed regarding the importance of the message. There cannot be any question regarding the Lord's blessing on tlie efforts put forth to distribute it; therefore let each one go forward and place this book. Many undoubtedly will place three or four times their quota during this period, but others, handicapped one way or another, may not be able to place so many, Each one should go forth depending upon the Lord and doing the best he can to the praise of Jehovah's name.</span></p>

Wc have fried to prevent the transcription machine from interfering with the field service and have harmonized it with the field activity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A pioneer has used the machine in a trailer as stated: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“We are now </span><span class="font3">in a country schoolyard with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font3">big house trailer and broadcast right out of one of the front windows. The people drive up </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">rigs, cars and on muleback and listen, and always say the program is too short.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The large attendance at ------</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">was secured by taking advantage of the fact that the merchants of that lively little town give the people free motion pictures every Saturday night; also every Wednesday night a free band concert is given. We got In touch with the proper parties and they gladly gave us permission to give our lecture just preceding the motion pictures on Saturday night and immediately following the band concert on Wednesday. The preachers were furious because of our presence, but there was no successful interference.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The manner in which the work with (he transcription machine supplements the door-to-door service instead of interfering with the house-to-house witness in any way is emphasized in the following report from a pioneer: “It would be a task indeed to have to give talks hy word of mouth so often, and a great drain on one's strength, which is so much needed in the pioneer work. Also Siow weak they would be as compared with Ilie lectures by Brother Rutherford over these machines, which seem to have no limit in power and volume' How easy It is now, merely to start the machine and turn on the power and si ill retain our strength for the witnessing of the next day!”</span></p>

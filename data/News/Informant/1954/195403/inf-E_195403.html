<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> It is important to remember the necessity of an appropriate theme in preparing assignments for the theocratic ministry school. The introduction and conclusion of both reading assignments should accentuate a theme that is germane to the material to be read. The third talk, a discourse based on the material read previously, should likewise have a theme that can be used appropriately in tying together the various points discussed. Careful consideration of the material will make it possible for students to select an appropriate theme, even though at times incidents and points discussed in chapters assigned may seem to be only slightly related.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> On completing a reading assignment, make comparisons showing the superiority of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Neio World Translation</span><span class="font4"> over other translations.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Endeavoring to take the right teaching to those hungering for knowledge, in the house-to-house work let us try to cover all congregation territory with the offer. Call back on all who have taken single copies of the magazine. Show them the advantage of having it come regularly. Remember, the new special subscription slip for insertion in distributors’ copies does not relieve us of the obligation to call back on those who receive single copies. Return calls should increase their interest. See that everyone is given the opportunity to subscribe for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Each One Has a Part</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> In addition to regular house-to-house preaching Jehovah's witnesses arrange to speak the good’ news effectively from the public platform. Public meetings have been the medium of arousing and assisting many persons to direct their paths so they too can bless Jehovah every day.’ Keeping abreast of other theocratic increase, this means of gospelpreaching has been increasing. Last year there were 97,607 public talks in the United States, to compare with 79,509 the previous year. This is a 22.8 per cent increase! Think of the benefits numerous persons of good will and publishers derived from those 97,607 talks!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Frequently it is at public meetings that newly interested persons become acquainted with Jehovah’s witnesses. If they and the brothers hovah is to continue the training program. All should be trained to present a three- to eight-minute sermon at the door. That all may become regular house-to-house preachers, servants and mature publishers will assist less mature publishers by taking them in the house-to-house work, on back-calls, when calling on subscribers, or by starting and turning studies over to them as they progress. Throughout March begin encouraging those you study with to join you in carrying the message to others. Ry training new publishers and assisting Irregular ones to get into the service we shall not only reach more people, but we shall be laying the groundwork to reach our 20 per cent increase goal for April.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> So onward, children of Jehovah ! Continue your teaching even as you are being taught through his Word, by means of his spirit and his organization. Be assured, Jehovah’s dedicated New World society, that “all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great shall be the peace of thy children” as you march on worshiping him in peace and unity.—Isa. 54:13, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">attending are to be edified the public speaker must do his part. He should treasure each assignment, spending sufficient time gathering appropriate material to make his talk instructive, up to date and alive. A variety of scriptures, rather than the same ones time and again, series after series, should be used. Jehovah has provided such an abundant storehouse to draw from that it is not necessary or advisable to overuse a few familiar scriptures. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font4"> will be a ready reference in selecting scriptures that are to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Before considering himself ready to mount the platform after preparing his talk, the speaker should rehearse his material. The giving of a talk is to be kept within an hour and should be delivered </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">•with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Taught Ones Teach Others</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Upon being taught the truth appreciative persons delight to share with others the good things they have been taught. (Gal. 6: 6, NW) This is taking place world-wide as more and more take teaching from Jehovah and in turn teach others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A group of publishers in Colombia was surprised on witnessing in a small village to be greeted with: ‘'Oh, you talk just like our neighbor,” appreciating the truth ‘the neighbor’ was teaching others. In another area while a witness called at the front door preaching the new-world hope, a Pentecostal was going to the back door telling householders not to listen. In time the Pentecostal took teaching from Jehovah and is now privileged to teach others the truth. (127)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I shall remain Catholic,” declared a woman who took a publication. Through a home Bible study she learned the truth and now is a publisher of the new world. (260, 261) And how long does it take to become a teacher? Not long, if you apply yourself. (90)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having a burning desire to tell others what he had learned, a young man studying to become a priest met a witness and asked: “Do you know what you are doing?” The witness knew what he was doing and convinced him. Now the young man is a pioneer. (137, 138)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“It’s a mystery, my son,” was the priest’s reply to a businessman’s inquiry about the trinity. One of Jehovah’s witnesses explained the “mystery” and now the businessman looks forward to teaching others as a missionary. (105) Are you teaching others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah's Provision</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of all magazines published today, “The Watchtower” stands in a class by itself. Why so? Because it is Jehovah’s provision to guide those who love him to understand and keep informed of his glorious kingdom. No wonder then all of Jehovah’s witnesses delight to take part in the 16th annual “Watchtower” campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By our utilizing three- to eight-minute sermons householders are assisted to know the value of “The Watchtower.” However, some householders need no introduction to it, as was true of one in North Borneo. He asked if he could subscribe for “the best magazine he had ever read,” without the witness’ even having a chance to present the offer. (244, 245)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a remote part of Finnmark two missionaries were greeted by an old man: “Do you really belong to my people?” He had read issues of “The Watchtower” a neighbor subscribed for, understood the truth and shared the provision with others. (220, 221)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To discourage parishioners from listening to Jehovah’s witnesses a priest in Egypt hung a copy of “The Watchtower” on the door of the church. Did it discourage them? Not at all! In fact, it made some so curious they hunted up the congregation servant and are now having home Bible studies. (144)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Magazine Day activity is devoted primarily to house-to-house and store-to-store work. However, occasionally street witnessing is done and interesting experiences result. A man walked up to a publisher in Switzerland saying: “I must have ‘The Watchtower.’ ” The man had been a Catholic monk but, thanks to Jehovah’s provisions, learned the truth and now shares it with others. (261)</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>To Those Who Know of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">During the last two months many favorably disposed persons have wisely subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> on our invitation. Others, just passively interested at the time, took single copies. These will be somewhat acquainted with the magazine and when approached later some will say : “Oh, yes, I know about </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This opens an excellent opportunity to respond something like this: “I’m happy to hear you know about </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Undoubtedly you, like so many other people, enjoy the Scriptural comfort it offers. Its pages are filled with heart-cheering information of a new world of God’s making now so close at hand. Jesus centered many illustrations around the new world for which he taught us to pray. One of them is found at Mark 4:14-20. There the Master said the word or truth was likened to seed that fell upon different types of soil. Some fell alongside the road where it could not grow; some upon rocky places where roots could not penetrate; some among the thorns only to be choked out by the cares of this world: and, most important, some fell upon soil that was right, took root, grew and bore fruit. We want to be of this last type of ‘soil’ and with this in view much</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">with conviction and enthusiasm. There is no short cut in doing this. It requires practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> The primary purpose of a public talk is to edify the hearers with the truth. While a portion of the talk may expose and show the falsity of the old system, the greater portion of it should be constructive, highlighting Kingdom truths on the theme assigned. It is the truth that will help those attending to make their minds over for new-world living. Make the truth stand out by a clear, logical presentation. This will enhance the desire on the part of the audience to hear more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Since these meetings are an integral part of the ministerial activity of a congregation, all associated should </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ahcays</span><span class="font4"> be present and ever be alert to assist others to attend. Public meetings are profitable. Something can be gained from each talk. So, attend and profit from the many depends upon our study of God's Word, for Jesus said at John 17:3: [Quote or read.] Inasmuch as this journal has aided so many to a clearer knowledge of the new world, I’m sure you would enjoy getting it regularly and benefiting too. For just one dollar you may have a year’s subscription and these three booklets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With our current offer we meet some who say, “I’ve subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> before.” The good news may be presented to these individuals several ways. The new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> features may be pointed out, doctrinal or other questions cleared up, emphasis placed on the need for Bible knowledge, things of interest in the current magazine highlighted, etc. You might say : “It certainly is a pleasure to talk to you. So many people today have little or no respect for God’s teachings, neglecting almost completely his counsel to be an approved workman, as 2 Timothy 2:15 calls to our attention. [Read or quote.] Having received </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> before. I’m sure you appreciate its value as a Bible study aid. The subscription is still only $1, and, as you know, it will come to you twice a month. I’ll be glad to serve you by taking your subscription now and leaving this issue with you. Soon the issues will be coming regularly to you through the mail.” hours of research each speaker spends in preparing his material. With each congregation having public meetings regularly, with each speaker fulfilling the serious responsibility placed upon him and with each publisher supporting these meetings to the full, we can look forward to even greater results from public meetings in 1954.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Preparing Three- to Eight-Minute Sermons</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I </span><span class="font3">(3 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">min.) </span><span class="font3">After a morning of witnessing two brothers discuss their activity. Brother Alert enthusiastically relates to Brother Willing how much more effective his witnessing is by using three- to eight-minute sermons. It is like doing a new work. 'Willing quietly listens and then says he has not been giving a sermon, not knowing how it is to be done and does not feel capable. Alert suggests they spend a few minutes to see just how easy it is to develop a talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE 11 (12 min.) </span><span class="font3">Alert explains first that a theme is to be selected. Various themes may be used, such as “The New World,’’ “The Importance of Bible Study,” “The Kingdom, Man’s Real Hope,” “Christ’s Purpose in Coming to Earth,” etc. Then material is selected to support the theme and to ’give a witness. Willing interrupts to ask how this is done. Selecting “The New World” theme, Alert counsels that to be effective witness should have introduction, body and conclusion. In the introduction of your witness establish who you are and the purpose of your call. Then move to the body, mentioning troubled world conditions and need for a new world. Basic points could be: (1) old world cannot satisfy desire of man, (2) basis for hope in new world, (3) what is necessary to enter new world, and (4) need for “The Watchtower” in attaining hope. A supporting scripture or two woven into talk will increase effectiveness and add authority to witness. Matthew 24: 37 show’s old-world conditions will pass away; John 3: 16 gives basis for new world; and Romans 12: 2 shows need for study. These simple basic points are noted and a mental outline formed to ensure directness at the door. In concluding witness restate the “Watchtower” offer. The various features of “The Watchtower” and its value in giving Scriptural help to understand God’s purposes can be highlighted. Brother Willing now understands just what should be done, likes the idea and will try it himself. It is not as difficult as he had thought. He will develop several sermons for variety. In summary Alert reiterates need for thorough preparation to give a good witness, hold attention of householder, and arouse interest even though offer may not always be placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Take Teaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I (4 min.)</span><span class="font3"> Congregation servant, “Watchtow’er” study conductor and school servant discuss need of taking teaching from Jehovah. Do all associated with the congregation regularly attend meetings? Each one compares number attending meeting he oversees with number associated and adds appropriate comments. Why do some who could attend regularly fail to do so? Or prefer one meeting over another? At this time Brother Fair and congregation book study conductor enter Kingdom Hall. They decide to discuss the matter with Brother Fair, w’ho does not attend regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (12 min.) </span><span class="font3">Tactfully the matter of meeting attendance is approached. Fair replies he feels tired after work and needs some relaxation, so he cannot always get to ministry school regularly. School servant relates that teaching received directly from Bible is needed source of refreshment and prepares us to talk truth more </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fully to persons of good</span><span class="font3"> will. Congregation servant tactfully brings up matter of Fair sometimes leaving after school. Fair explains he does not al-W’ays stay since he always reads the “Informant” and likes to be home and retire early. On questioning him the congregation servant ascertains Fair does not retire very early even when leaving the meeting. He then points out that the service meeting is especially prepared to improve our ministry. House-to-house work must increase and we must more effectively minister to people desirous of fleeing to safety with the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Book study conductor then asks about attendance at his study. “Too busy these days,” is Fair’s reply. Conductor stresses advantage of group study and service. “Watchtower” conductor relates it is nice to have Fair attend “Watchtower” study after public talk. Fair says he does not always attend these meetings because he wants some time w’ith his family and it is about the only chance he gets. Conductor reasons on importance of all in family attending lectures and “Watchtower” studies where chief instrument of “faithful and discreet slave” in ministering food is considered. “Watchtower” campaign demands that we know and appreciate its lifesaving message to help others. Fair is encouraged and expresses appreciation for counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE III (4 min.) After Fair leaves servants analyze and discuss: (1) Old-world system keeps publishers busy trying to make ends meet. (2) AI] must realize that while attending meetings and .service keeps one busy, yet it is practical and best for Kingdom interests. (3) Meetings are for good of all, being God's provision to bless his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">people. (4) New-world</span><span class="font3"> discussion and association is relaxing as well as uplifting and should be enjoyed by all family members. (5) Servants must do their part by planning and conducting good, lively and instructive meetings, and publishers must do their part by regularly attending and encouraging others to do </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">so.</span></p>

Do not spend much time on one or two points and thus slight others of importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Principles of good speaking should be kept in mind in caring for the reading assignment. The reading should be natural and expressive so it will not sound as though the material is being read. Audience contact should also be maintained as much as possible. The material should be read aloud many times beforehand in order to achieve proper sense stress, pausing, correct pronunciation and fluency. Preparation is the key to successful and edifying student talks.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Start Organizing April Activity Now</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> April will be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> full, happy, busy month of theocratic activity for all who “engage in pastoral work with the Shepherd-Prince.” (Ezek. 34:23, 24) Memorial falls on Saturday the 17th, the new public talks start the 18th, all publishers should have engaged in house-to-house witnessing by the 18th. It is the final month of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign and each congregation will want to be able to say “We made it!” for the 20 per cent increase. Briefly, that is our activity for April.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Subscription Renewals</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> More subscription renewals are being received now than ever before. Chiefly, this is due to subscribers' being called upon and given an opportunity to renew their subscription before it expires. To promptly and efficiently handle these renewals and to take care of the thousands of new subscriptions pouring in daily, the Society’s office will appreciate it if all comply with the following suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">- Eakly renewals : When submitting a renewal for a subscription that has not yet expired, flu out the subscription slip exactly as shown on the address label appearing on the magazine or wrapper. Mark the slip clearly as a “renewal.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>3</sup> Renewal notice : The Society inserts a renewal notice in the magazine when a subscription is about to expire. This slip should be used whenever possible. Attaching the address label from the magazine or the wrapper will be a help to the office.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>4</sup> New subscriptions : ‘Insufficient Address,’ ‘No Such Post Office,’ and ‘Subscriber Unknown </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font4"> This Address,’ etc., are reasons magazines are returned, with great inconvenience to subscribers and added expense to the Society. So carefully fill in each subscription slip. Make certain the city or town in the subscriber’s address is the post office town from which mail is received. Never abbreviate the name of the street or city and in larger cities always include zone numbers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> If these suggestions are carefully followed, the net result will be time saved in handling renewal subscriptions, a minimum of complaints, and uninterrupted service assured to subscribers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s people will arrange to attend and will invite persons of good will to attend the Memorial on Saturday and the public talk on Sunday. Additionally, special group witnessing will be arranged the 17th and 18th and encouragement will be given to all publishers and good-will persons to join in the activities. Between April 1 and 18 all should engage in house-to-house preaching. The total number who do is to be reported to the Society on the Memorial card. Congregation servants will plan a stimulating service meeting just before Memorial and outline local arrangements for one and all to</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> To unitedly “preach the word” and continually Improve ministerial activities, Jehovah’s witnesses look forward to regularly attending and being edified from well-prepared service meetings. A great deal of thought, time, effort and co-operation are required for wholesome, instructive meetings to result.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The congregation servant is responsible for planning instructive, well-balanced and interesting meetings. Upon receiving the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font4">he will study it thoroughly and then plan meetings for the entire month. The article dealing with ministerial work for the current month will be considered at the first meeting of the month, if at all possible, while the article dealing with the next month’s activity will be considered at the last service meeting of the month. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font4"> will be considered in accord with instructions appearing in the January, 1954, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font4"> Other </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> articles and local ministerial matters to be considered may be worked into different weeks’ programs where desired.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> To ensure coherence each meeting should be developed around a theme. Brothers preparing parts will have the theme in mind and work it into their part. The first meeting should highlight the current month’s theme as outlined in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font4">while succeeding program themes may be based upon the daily text or an appropriate Scriptural theme.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Demonstrations, pantomimes, interviews, round-table discussions, quizzes, forums, dialogues, question-enjoy a grand week end of service.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> April brings to a close the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-toicer</span><span class="font4"> campaign. By the end of the month will we in the United States have obtained 400,000 new subscriptions? It will be determined by preaching activity during the month. And during April assist all publishers to share in Kingdom service. With study conductors and ones privileged to train others diligently doing their part, and an invitation given to new ones to join, April </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">will see</span><span class="font4"> a 20 per cent increase as all congregations will be able to write “We made it!” on their report.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> By carrying out the above suggestions during April, it will be a full, happy, busy and blessed month for all.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark25"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">and-answer discussions, service talks (using secondary </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles, etc. 1 and other methods to present the material may be used. Generally a meeting will have three or four different parts, handled various ways for variety. Other servants may be consulted for program suggestions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> It is a privilege to impart instructions to a congregation. Brothers will wisely accept each assignment and spend sufficient time preparing so proper edification will result. Every part should be rehearsed before It is presented and each should stay within his allotted time so the service meeting does not exceed one hour in length. While demonstrations, etc., may be lively, it should always be kept in mind that the purpose of a service meeting is to impart ministry instructions, not to entertain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Since everyone will want to contribute to meetings as opportunity affords, the next week’s program should be announced at the end of each service meeting. Articles to be considered by discussion or other ways calling for congregation participation can thus be studied before the next meeting. Many will then be able to join in the discussion and contribute toward an instructive meeting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> With the congregation servant planning instructive meetings, those assigned parts preparing properly and all associated attending regularly, the service meeting will provide instruction for all to more effectively “preach the word” as Jehovah's ministers.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Encouraging Words</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">i “What a grand provision for all to enjoy!” “Many publishers here really appreciate the opportunity to pioneer. There is no finer way to spend time.” Daily the Society receives such expressions from appreciative congregation publishers, regular and vacation pioneers of all ages. Whole families have written in for applications and some congregations write : “Arrangements are being made so that practically every publisher will pioneer some time during the year.” One writes: “Thus far, we have 11 regular and 10 vacation pioneers. This makes our congregation of 59 publishers very happy.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Typical are these encouraging words from new pioneers: “My experiences the past weeks have been very happy ones. Just a taste, but, my, how refreshing! They’ve whetted my appetite for more.” Another, “The many joys and blessings that Jehovah’s service brings are greatly multiplied while pioneering. All publishers should take advantage of this arrangement. I </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font5"> they will be glad they did.” And, “I’ve always wanted October issues, in addition to the public lectures now contained in each issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> During October offer the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">subscription and three booklets on a $1 contribution. The quota for each congregation publisher is one new subscription and for pioneers, four. AS shown below, each year since 1951 we have been coming closer to meeting this quota.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Awake!” Total Per Cent of Campaign Subscriptions Quota</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Yes, the 100 per cent goal is definitely within • sight. Last year we were just nicely getting started with three- to eight-minute sermons when we obtained 133,466 new </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">to increase my service privileges. Here is the way.” One writes, “Not just vacation pioneering for me—I want to be a regular pioneer from now on.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Inspiring and confident are the words from pioneers who have served for years: “Pioneering has taught me to have full confidence in Jehovah. It keeps me doing his will and leaves </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">no</span><span class="font5"> time for nonessentials. It’s been the happiest time of my life. I wouldn’t trade it for anything.” Another says, “It’s a lifetime career without equal. Spending each day in service gives one peace of mind and pleasure, builds a keener appreciation for Jehovah’s loving-kindness and makes one want to show gratitude.” And this noteworthy one, “Jesus’ words ‘there Is more happiness in giving’ have certainly proved true. What a thrill to help others! My only regret is that I didn’t start sooner.”</span></p></li>

That is the highest number of subscriptions ever taken in a single month! Undoubtedly, this October will be even better, since </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font5">of us will be using three- to eightminute sermons in our house-to-house ministry with the offer </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all five </span><span class="font5">Sundays of the month. Spend at least two hours each Sunday morning in the house-to-house work and then an hour or so making back-calls. Midweek witnessing arrangements should also be made. With all of us doing our part, we shall far exceed our previous peak of 133,466 new subscriptions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Engage, then, in this pure pleasure of blessing the new-world Sovereign’s name in October.

By doing so you will bring happiness to yourself and to others.</span></p></li></ul><a name="caption2"></a>

<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Attend Regularly</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Attendance at all meetings of Jehovah’s people today is very urgent. Next to the Bible </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">is one of the most enlightening influences upon the earth. The study of it privately and with the congregation is indispensable. The service meeting and ministry school are likewise enlightening forces necessary to a broader vision and to equip each one of us for new-world living and theocratic service. Congregation book studies and public meetings are provided by Jehovah to give us greater understanding of Kingdom truths.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The great truths of the Kingdom and its requirements cannot -be explored by us apart from our brothers. Jehovah never purposed that they should, for we are told that ‘no prophecy is of private release’ and ‘not to forsake the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the Custom, but encourage one another, and all the more so as the day draws near.’ (2 Pet. 1:20 and Heb. 10:25, A'U j With these points in view, let</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 2,)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Means of Awakening</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How will people call upon Jehovah if they are not preached to? All of Jehovah's witnesses know the answer to this question and therefore diligently arrange to share regularly in the preaching work and to present literature, knowing that through the spoken and printed explanation of the Scriptures many will be awakened to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From all walks and ways of life people of good will toward God are awaking to the truth. It is not the past that counts, but, rather, what one does upon learning the truth. You will enjoy reading what effect the truth had on a hardened criminal in Hawaii. (172)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through the assistance of “Let God Be True” many thousands have been awakened to the truth. And it does not take long, as shown in the report from North Borneo. (245)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even tracts can be used effectively. “Awake from Sleep!” was left with a lady in South Africa who was not too receptive. After reading the tract, what did the lady do? She immediately looked up the publisher to subscribe for “Awake!” (247)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And speaking of “Awake!” A man in Peru was so impressed with this magazine that he wrote a fine article about it and had it published in a prominent student paper. The result? Others were influenced to subscribe for “Awake!” (230)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Being awake ourselves and knowing the merits of “Awake!” we should all diligently present the subscription offer from house to house this month. It will be the means of awakening many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Youthful Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Does one have to be old in years to understand the truth? To take a firm stand? To preach? The 1954 “Yearbook of Jehovatvs Witnesses” contains many fine reports showing that youthful witnesses are doing fine work and have Jehovah’s blessing and favor as they share in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In France three girls, 11, 15 and 17, learned the truth and started attending meetings. What happened? Read the interesting account on page 154 of how, among other things, they exasperated the village priest with their knowledge of the Bible to the point that the priest warned all his parishioners against listening to the truth spoken by an 11-year-old girl! Another fine example is found on page 196.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the tender age of five a youthful witness in Nicaragua effectively told her grandmother why her speechless, sightless and deaf images are -worthless. She is also able to witness alone at the doors. This is another good example of what results when parents assist their children to have a solid foundation for life in the new world. (207)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Youthful witnesses, are you regularly engaging in magazine activity? Have you tried starting a magazine route around your home? You can effectively take part in this feature of the ministry as shown by the example of other young ministers in Greece. (166)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All youthful witnesses should regularly attend meetings and be attentive during them so as to learn from them. Participate in them, too, as appropriate occasions are afforded and then </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">regular in the ministry by sharing in field service.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Uppermost in the minds of men today are the troubles in the world. Tliis gives us a wonderful opportunity to develop pointed three- to eightminute sermons based on world conditions, and when </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">offering Awake!</span><span class="font5"> to point out that it covers world events along with many other fields of knowledge. As a basis for your theme you might use Luke 21 as follows :</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> “Good morning I [Introduce yourselves.] We are calling on honest-hearted people today’ concerning the troubles on the earth. Needless to say, there are much wickedness, suffering and corruption throughout the world, and in almost every home there is unhappiness. All of us have wondered why these conditions exist and what the remedy might be. The Bible shows there is a reason for these troubles. Jesus spoke of such conditions afflicting mankind, at Luke 21:10,11, [read and apply to events of last forty years]. In fact, he foretold that conditions would become so bad that heart disease (America’s No. 1 killer) would Increase, as verses 25 and 26 show. Seeing these things happening makes us want to understand </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font5"> they are happening and what they all mean. In verse 31 Jesus said these troubles would mark the nearness of the Kingdom, for which we have prayed. All claiming to be Christians must now keep awake to world happenings and their meaning, for Jesus shows in verse 36 that the majority of</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Since January, 1954, on the average, approximately 47,000 (28 per cent) publishers have not attended the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study each week: 65,000 (38 per cent), the service meeting; 68,000 ( 40 per cent), the ministry school and 58,000 (34 per cent), the congregation book studies. These brothers love Jehovah but apparently do not realize that they are looking upon Jehovah's table with an attitude bordering on contempt. Attending meetings and participating in them are essential to theocratic well-being and proper Kingdom service.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Another might be: “I am making a friendly call on you with a message of comfort in these distressing times. No doubt in looking at conditions in the world today you realize the seriousness of this time period in which we are living and desire to know what hope there is for world peace. Under divine inspiration Jeremiah, a faithful prophet, in his prophecy at chapter 8, well outlined our condition today. Verse 15 reads: [read from Bible]. Notice, too, how the nations are fulfilling his words at Jeremiah 6:14. God assures us at Isaiah 9: 6, 7 that his provision is for a government of permanent peace for righteous mankind. In order to gain true peace we need to be taught by Jehovah, as Isaiah 54:13 and Psalm 2:10-12 show’. To aid people to be awake, not only to conditions of the world, but also the remedy—‘God's government of peace'—I feel sure you will appreciate this timely journal entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! . .</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> By participating in the house-to-house work often this month, using these or other pointed three- to eightminute sermons at every door when making the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font5"> subscription offer, it will be your good pleasure to assist many persons of good will to become regular readers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Know Your Magazine</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font4">following two demonstrations </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font4">to assist all publishers to become familiar with the material in the October 8 and 22 issues of '‘Awake!” which will be used during the campaign. Consider the October 8 issue as early in October as possible and the October 22 issue two weeks later. Announcement should be made to the brothers well in advance so that all publishers may prepare to take part and benefit from the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">First Meeting: A </span><span class="font4">panel of “experts” on platform faces congregation, fully prepared to answer any questions propounded by audience. Questions asked should bring points to view that can be used in “Awake!” presentation. They should arouse Interest and curiosity and create a desire in others to have more information, which an “Aw’ake!” subscription will supply. Chairman will act as moderator and see that things are kept moving. He will call upon various ones so that as many as possible are given opportunity to take part. Quick and ready questions from the audience as well as prompt answers from the “panel” will allow for greatest coverage. Each “panel” member can be given a turn in rotation in answering questions, or raised hands can indicate readiness. The chairman should see to it that time spent and questions asked are properly proportioned so that each article gets some consideration. “Do You Know?” questions on page 28 of each issue may be used in addition to the ones publishers make up for this meeting. With answers brief and to the point, this meeting will be most lively, informative and beneficial to all in becoming acquainted with “Awake!” magazine used during the first part of the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Second Meeting: </span><span class="font4">A brother will be assigned to prepare good, pointed questions on “Awake!” The audience will be told the week before to come prepared to answer questions on any article in the October 22 issue. A minimum of pausing will avoid loss of time and yield best results, so stress preparation. The brother should prepare some questionson each article. Interestcanbe added by calling upon the group seated on one side of the hall and then the other. With many brothers answering the questions, zest will be added to the part, making it absorbing and profitable. True and false statements can be asked periodically. Questions on detailed statistics or complex data are not necessary. Rather, use interesting points that publishers may use in pre- <sup>1 </sup>senting the magazine. With all publishers being thoroughly acquainted with the magazines used during the campaign and by all taking a full part in the house-to-house service, this will be the best “Awake!” campaign to date.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Congregation Publisher’s Record Cards</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">When congregation publishers move to another locality, they should take their Publisher’s Record card with them and give it to the new congregation servant. Also, as far in advance as possible, they should send the Society a change of address for persona] </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> subscriptions, giving both old and new addresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Alert and Awake</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">October will undoubtedly be the best “Awake!” campaign to date. More publishers than ever before will take part in this campaign and all of us are better equipped than ever to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">present effectively</span><span class="font4"> this excellent magazine after giving a three- to eight-minute sermon. The keynote to successful witnessing during the month of October, as of all other months, is preparation. For best results prepare and practice your sermon before going into the field work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE I (5 min.) Mother and daughter (or son) in kitchen preparing Sunday breakfast discuss day’s activities. Both look forward to using their sermons in the field, and comment on how many good experiences they have had using them. So that all can have a part in and stay longer in the service, mother has made preliminary preparations for Sunday dinner. She comments as to how much better it is to plan ahead this way so as not to have to stay at home Sunday morning while the rest are enjoying field service privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (16 min.) </span><span class="font4">Father comes in at end of discussion and compliments his industrious wife. He is glad all have arranged to spend a portion of Sunday together in Jehovan’s work. All sit down to table (conductor narrates while others pantomime consideration of text, prayer and the reading of a branch report). Then discussion turns to sermons for the day. Father asks mother what theme she is going to use; then he suggests that he act as householder and listen to her presentation. Mother gives a four-minute sermon from start to finish. Father offers a point or two of counsel and then asks his daughter to give one she has prepared. Mother acts as householder while father listens. Daughter gives a good three-minute sermon. Father makes a suggestion or two and then gives a five-minute sermon. In conclusion, as they leave the table and prepare to reach the contact point on time, father commends all for being well prepared to take part in the “Awake!” campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Conclusion: (3 min.) Conductor points out the value of each one’s preparing sermon in advance and then practicing the sermon before another and receiving suggestions. Being prepared gives one greater joy in the field and makes for a more effective presentation. Endeavor to use three- to eight-minute sermons at every door in presenting the “Awake!” subscription offer.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Promptly Handle New Subscriptions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">To provide new subscribers with good service it is necessary for subscription slips to be sent to the Society's office promptly. Publishers are requested to turn in immediately all new subscription slips to the accounts servant. He will carefully check each slip to see that it has been properly filled out. The complete name and address of subscribers should be given. Do not abbreviate the name of the city or the street. As the zone number is very important, please see that it is given correctly. Congregation servants are requested to see that subscription slips are sent promptly to the Society each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Thing#<sup>9 </sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2nd Week:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Communism (pages 65-67) Back-call: Publisher makes return call on person who made the claim that the Bible supports communism. Publisher proves (1) that early Christian congregation was not communistic though members helped one another, (2) that each Christian was responsible to provide for his own household and did not covet another’s property, (3) that Christians recognize God as supreme and do not try to overthrow governments and laws, (4) that Christians bring up their children in the discipline and the authoritative advice of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4th Week:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Confession (pages 67-70)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During home Bible study a Catholic person brings up question on confession. On concluding study, publisher starts on page 68 and clarifies how and through whom Christians are to make confession for shortcomings and sins, and sums up with definition and origin of unscriptural practice of confessing to priests.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>New Arrangement for Ordering Bound Volumes</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">It will not be necessary for congregations and individual publishers to place orders for bound volumes of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines a year in advance as heretofore.

It will be appreciated if publishers order volumes through the congregation, so all orders for a congregation can be combined. The cost for a volume remains $2. When you have sent in an order for volumes and your address changes before the order is filled, please be sure to send in your change of address for mailing the volumes ordered.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> For over a year now, in accord with arrangements made during the circuit servant’s visit, mature publishers have been assisting other publishers. It is a joy to observe how well the arrangements are being established in the congregations and supported by publishers wholeheartedly co-operating.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> In order to keep abreast with the progress being made, circuit servants will make adjustments at the proper time to keep progressive arrangements in operation at all times. After serving a congregation several times the circuit servant should not spend all his time working with those who are already assigned to assist others and who are doing good work. He should work with those who have progressed to the point where they possibly qualify to assist another and with those who are assigned to assist others but who may still need help themselves. Other available time will be spent working with publishers who attend the service center.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> As heretofore, congregation servants will supply circuit servants with a list of all congregation book studies and publishers assigned to each. He will recommend which studies the circuit servant is to work with and show which publishers he feels to be qualified to assist others but who have not been assigned as yet to do so. He will also show who have been assigned and then Indicate who, if any, among those asslgped to assist others could use further assistance themselves. (Circuit servants will continue to check personally Publisher’s Record cards for deinitial call is an excellent means to build up the original interest and lends greater effectiveness to return calls. Endeavor to develop back-calls into Bible studies. Remember our goal: Every publisher conducting at least one Bible study. Also, let us keep in mind the quota of each publisher: the placing of at least two magazines each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> The work of gathering the desirable ones from all nations continues to grow and expand. A vast multitude now fills Jehovah’s house with glory and praise. Share now in aiding unnumbered others to come into the blessed surroundings of Jehovah’s organization and to add their voices to his further glory and praise.</span></p></li></ul>

This is to be done for each day of his visit. With congregation servants diligently supplying this most important information the circuit servant is able to spend time most effectively during the entire week with the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> In harmony with the June, 1954, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font5"> the circuit servant should make definite arrangements for two publishers to work together. Where-ever possible he will get the two publishers together and discuss what is required. Occasionally it may be necessary to assign a publisher to assist another where the opportunity is not afforded to get them together privately to discuss the assignment. In this case the assignment should be made and the congregation servant given the responsibility to see personally that the two publishers understand the arrangement. By making assignments during the week rather than waiting until Sunday evening, the circuit servant will be able, in most cases, to get the publishers together himself and discuss arrangements.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The circuit servant should make a thorough examination of the training program each time he serves a congregation and then make whatever adjustments he may find necessary to ensure greater progress. It should not be necessary for the circuit servant to make major adjustments in the basic setup each time he serves a congregation, but adjustments can be made in individual assignments when necessary to keep the program progressive.</span></p></li></ul>

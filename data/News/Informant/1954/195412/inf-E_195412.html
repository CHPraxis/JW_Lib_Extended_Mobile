<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Where there is life, there is action. Jehovah’s New World society is proof of that. Striving to live according to Jehovah’s standard, we are united as a hard-working, right-living society preaching for his name's sake.

This is the month we want to report for our 10 per cent increase, “We made it I” To do so will require at least 169,366 public praisers 1 It means (1) each of us preaching, (2) assistance being rendered to the new and irregular, and (3) new publishers being started.

<p><span class="font4">Just in time for use in the 17th annual </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign comes the release of the new 32-page booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”. It</span><span class="font4"> has been provided to supply Kingdom publishers with a booklet containing basic Kingdom truths to use in field service. This booklet will be gratefully received by persons of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each congregation is invited to order a supply of this booklet immediately, so that it will be on hand tn time for use during the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">campaign. Use this booklet and two older ones as the premium for each new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower or Awake!</span><span class="font4"> subscriber. Endeavor to leave a copy at each home. If a subscription is not obtained a booklet can be placed for a small contribution. Make a notation of each booklet placement and make a return call, with the following in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A New Feature</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This booklet has questions covering each paragraph. It is a very easy booklet to study with interested persons. Having studied the material in the October 15 issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>“Going to Europe?”</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> “Are you going to attend the European conventions in 1955?” During the last year this question has been a favored topic of theocratic discussion and will continue to be for the next few months. But not only is it a subject for discussion! Now is the time for action! Time is rapidly flying by! The European conventions are only eight months off. If you are going to attend, now is the time to decide and make definite plans and arrangements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> For over a year now the Society has been working to obtain sufficient travel accommodations for those going to Europe. However, to complete arrangements and make the accommodations definite, the Society must know the exact number of delegates going to Europe. Therefore, if you are going to Europe under the Society’s arrangements, fill out a transportation application form and send it to the Society just as soon as pos-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Making Adjustments for Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To have Jehovah’s blessing and favor his worshipers must render clean and acceptable service. This requires not only preaching new-world living to others but also living it. (1 Cor. 6: 9, NW) The “Yearbook” contains many interesting accounts of the effort put forth by those loving Jehovah to make adjustments and live by his commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In compliance with the explanation of “The Watchtower,” that in order to maintain Jehovah’s spirit and expect increase it is vital to have a clean organization, letters covering commonlaw marriage were sent to congregations in Cuba. (130, 131) It meant difficulties and sacrifice to meet God’s righteous requirements, but not one publisher had to be disfellowshiped because of rebelliousness. Publishers in Haiti (170, 171) and Puerto Rico (239) are making adjustments for life, to the amazement of many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Should uncleanness be permitted? No! It was necessary to clean out considerable immorality in the British West Indies in 1952, but now fine progress is being made by Jehovah’s clean worshipers. (114, 115) Also, see Sierra Leone. (241, 242)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Just what are individuals willing to do to comply with God’s commands? When a crippled sister in British Honduras understood she had to make a choice between continuing a sinful life and living the truth, she happily selected the truth. (108) On pages 267, 181 and 182 you will read of publishers in Venezuela and Indonesia that made adjustments and are now living for the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Congregation Book Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not only has the importance of this study in gaining Bible knowledge come to be appreciated greatly in recent years by Kingdom publishers, but its use as a center for service has also come to be appreciated. Therefore, the Society has arranged for circuit servants to visit and work from these centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where they are being fully used and supported by publishers splendid results are in evidence. Take France, as an example. (153) Two hundred new studies were there organized in six months, resulting in 1,300 more persons attending and working from them. The branch servant writes that much of France’s increase can be attributed to a better appreciation of the value of the congregation book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From Finland comes the report that at the Society’s suggestion more congregation book studies were started. An illustration of how persons of good will are assisted through these studies is found on page 150.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Congregation book study conductors are not only privileged to conduct an interesting and informative study but must also take a zealous lead in field work. All who are assigned to the study should be assisted regularly. Argentina (87), Nigeria (208), the United States (72) and Uruguay (265-266) all report grand progress by greater use of the congregation book study arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Congregation servants, is the congregation book study arrangement being fully utilized locally? Study conductors, are you taking the lead in service? Publishers, do you regularly attend the study and support field service contacts? Let all of us utilize this splendid arrangement more and more.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> During December the minds of most people are turned to the “Christmas” celebration. Jehovah’s people will be alert to use this occasion tactfully to turn the minds of those they contact toward new-world blessings. This can be done by preparing and giving three- to eight-minute sermons especially appropriate for this season. You might use the following in offering the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> or the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Neto World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> and a book:</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">people try to get a little joy out of life. Troubles, yes, w<sup>T</sup>e all have them, but it is refreshing to let our minds turn to God and the provision of his Son, Christ Jesus. During this month many people show a little interest in the account of the birth of Jesus, and some in the words of the angel who made the announcement to the shepherds, saying, as shown at Luke 2:10,11 [read]. What does it mean that that joy 1,900 years ago was shared not only by shepherds but was extended even to the heavenly host, as the Bible account goes on to show at verses 13 and 14? [Read.] And why was this announcement such a joyous one? It was because they were looking forward to our day, when God’s purpose to crush</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Special Activity</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> December 25 has been set aside as a special Magazine Day. Arrange for group witnessing to start as early as is practical and spend the day in house-to-house magazine work. Congregations should ascertain immediately the number of magazines they need for use on this special Magazine Day and send their order to the Society by air mail right away, so that, magazines can be sent in time for the “holiday” work. A tremendous witness will be given if all publishers share in this activity. The Society would appreciate receiving outstanding experiences enjoyed on this special Magazine Day and reports and comments from congregations having high placements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Throughout the “holiday” period group witnessing should be organized so that young and old can energetically live now as a New World society and advance its Interests during the time off that they have.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">2 the one responsible for sin and world trouble, namely, Satan the Devil, would be accomplished, as written at 1 John 3: 8 [read]. Jesus is the one who will bring about the end of Satan and sin. But greater blessings are yet in store, for with the complete end of Satan full joy will be experienced by those living on the earth, as Revelation 21: 3, 4 tells [read]. This modern language translation of the Greek Scriptures and this Bible study aid book will assist you to consider these most important matters. You may have these two for the small contribution of $2.” (Both volumes of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font4"> may be offered for a $3 contribution, if you wish to make that offer.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> After you complete your witness many householders will sincerely wish you holiday greetings. What may the tactful publisher say? Since you have completed your witness and are in the process of leaving, a brief comment like this will generally suffice: “Thank you. And may I wish you many hours of joy and happiness learning more about God's love and the blessings soon to be realized through his kingdom.” If no literature was placed, then perhaps you might reply: “Thank you. And in parting may I give you this little tract </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a New World.&quot; </span><span class="font4">Other tracts may also be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“This Good News . . </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d} tower,</span><span class="font4"> all publishers will be well equipped to make back-calls and study It with others. It is the Society’s hope that this booklet will open the way for many more back-calls and home Bible studies with persons of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Going to Europe?” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d} </span><span class="font4">sible. This will enable the Society to know for exactly how many to plan transportation. Your early co-operation will help the Society to expedite travel arrangements for you.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> A number have asked: Will the Society accept deposits on reservations to Europe? The answer is: Yes; deposits will be accepted and reservations held, provided the Society is guaranteed full payment for travel by the end of February, 1955. Chartered-ship fares range from $260 to $350, round trip.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> So, if you are going to Europe, see your congregation servant for additional information and start now making definite arrangements to go.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Starting Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The need for more Bible studies was highlighted in the November “Informant.” How may they be started? Various ways, a few of which will be illustrated. The Bible study servant will act as chairman and see that the following three methods are clearly and simply presented to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE I (7 min.) Frequently a study can be started very easily when literature is first placed. Publishers and pioneers using the following method, when householder’s time and circumstances permit, have had excellent results. Demonstrate: Publisher gives four-minute sermon and places literature. Alert publisher then asks householder if he has just a minute, so that publisher can demonstrate how the book may interestingly be considered. Householder invites publisher in. Turning to the front of the book, publisher points to the question at the bottom of the page, has it read, then has the paragraph read, after which the question is discussed. A few more paragraphs are briefly considered, to the householder’s liking. Careful not to overstay his welcome, publisher tells householder he must leave but would like to return and continue very interesting discussion. Arrangements are made. Publisher encourages householder to read the next few pages before he returns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE II (5 min.) Bible study servant next explains that if householder above had not had time to invite publisher in when literature was placed, the publisher tactfully would have asked: “Well, then, may I call back and demonstrate how it may be used effectively by you?” On the back-call, after greeting and a few appropriate comments bearing on material in book to be considered, publisher proceeds to demonstrate use of book to householder, following same procedure as above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE III (12 min.) Bible study servant next explains that, while many studies can </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">be started by using the </span><span class="font1">above two methods, others will be started by following up placements with 10- to 15-minute back-call sermons. “Let God Be True” was placed with a householder who questioned the truthfulness of the Bible. Preparing for the back-call publisher remembered “Awake!” article “Why the Bible Is True.” (October 8, 1954) From it he prepared a sermon that upon completion would lead into consideration of material in Chapter I of “Let God Be True”. Have publisher give 10-minute sermon on why the Bible is true. On concluding his sermon he leads householder into consideration of Chapter I. After a few paragraphs are discussed publisher makes arrangements to return and continue discussion next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">CONCLUSION (2 min.) Bible study servant encourages all seriously to consider starting and continuing home Bible studies. Being alert and taking the initiative as illustrated will aid you to start Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Overcoming Objections</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE I (2 min.) In a brief introduction conductor points out the need of constantly improving our ministry. When confronted with objections in our presentation at the doors instead of continuing, with negative results, we should try to overcome them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE II (3 min.) Faithful meets Mature, who is bubbling over with good experiences had in the service. Faithful is a bit discouraged because he found it difficult to give his sermon effectively that morning. He had given good preparation to the sermon, but was confronted with objections that made it difficult to finish the sermon at the doors. Faithful is invited by Mature to come to his home that evening so that they can discuss the problems with some other friends and work out solutions together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE III (13 min.) Group of four or five at Mature’s home begins by relating brief field experiences. Mature mentions that some have encountered objections in the field and it would be well </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to discuss the objections, so that </span><span class="font1">all can meet them effectively. (These can be taken up in an informal manner, with everyone in the group offering suggestions on the points raised.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">(1) “I agree with those at the World Council of Churches that said we should establish Christ’s kingdom now.” Refutation: ‘Certainly all of us would like to see things better, but, since we know our hope is the Kingdom, we must know what God says about it in his Word, for the Kingdom hope originated with him. Since you are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sincere </span><span class="font1">in your interest, I know you will enjoy what is found in these few Bible texts: (John 18: 36; Ps. 2: 2, 9-11; 1 Cor. 4: 8; Dan. 7: 13, 14; 2: 44).’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">(2) &quot;How can you believe the Bible? It is so contradictory.” Points in refutation: (a) ‘What point in particular do you have in mind?' (Usually it is just a statement they have heard other people make, without proof.) (b) ‘Perhaps I can point out one of those “contradictions” that was shown me. (Eccl. 1: 4 versus 2 Pet. 3: 7) The context in 2 Peter shows that it is the wicked system of things that will be destroyed and not the literal globe and heavenly bodies. When statements are lifted out of their context they often appear to be contradictory. However, the Bible contradicts, not itself, but the wrong ideas men have acquired.’ (Other good points on these and other objections can be found in “Make Sure of All Things” and other books published by the Society.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE IV (2 min.) Conductor sums up, showing the need to become ever more effective in our ministry, to overcome objections and to return to sermon as quickly as possible to present “this good news of the kingdom” properly. Discuss service problems freely with other publishers and then work with your training-program partner to apply the good suggestions offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Preaching Together in Unity”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font4">the territory and advertising servants have been combined. This servant will be known as the magazine-territory servant. After reading the duties set out for this servant the congregation committee will submit to the Society the names of the two brothers whom they recommend for this position, indicating first and second choices. If the circuit servant will be visiting your congregation before January 1, 1955, he will recommend a brother for this position on his report at the end of the visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup> Pioneering:</span><span class="font4"> Publishers applying for this service will fill out a pioneer application blank and give it to the congregation servant. He will show their month-by-month field service for the last year on the application and then the application will be considered by the committee. The application containing the above information and the committee’s letter of recommendation will be forwarded to the Society by the congregation servant. When a pioneer is enrolled the Society will send the Pioneer Appointment letter in care of the congregation servant and notify the local congregation of the pioneer’s appointment. Congregations will be kept advised of pioneer appointments and removals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup> Publisher's Record Cards:</span><span class="font4"> This file will be arranged in two sections. One section is to contain, in alphabetical order, all Publisher’s Record cards of dedicated publishers. The other section will contain, in alphabetical order, the records of persons who have not symbolized their dedication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>8</sup> Literature Cheek Sheet:</span><span class="font4"> With this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> a sample copy and small supply of this new form are being sent. (This form may now be ordered. The price is five cents for fifty copies.) It is believed that this form will be of great assistance to the literature servant as he carries out his duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>9</sup> Back-Calls:</span><span class="font4"> The booklet emphasizes the responsibility each publisher has to keep a record of and to follow up his literature and subscription placements. Therefore, it will not be necessary for the accounts servant to supply the Bible study servant with a copy of the subscription record sheet for subscription follow-up work, since the responsibility rests upon each publisher to see that this is properly done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Who Are Entitled to Copies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Congregation servants will see that only dedicated publishers are given a copy of this booklet. (No exceptions are to be made.) Publishers are to sign the booklet in the congregation servant’s presence. An initial supply will be sent to each congregation. As additional copies are needed they may be ordered. Pioneers working with congregations will receive their individual copies from the congregation servant. Pioneers serving in isolated territory will receive a copy from the Society. Isolated publishers who have symbolized their dedication may request copies from the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> This booklet has been prepared by the Society to aid dedicated servants of Jehovah to preach together in unity. Let each of us, therefore, become familiar with its contents and apply the counsel in his individual ministry. If that is done the work will go along in peace, systematically and effectively, as a great witness is given to the praise of Jehovah’s name by his united New World society’s preaching together in unity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Inquiries have been made whether extra sets of the film &quot;The New World Society in Action” are available for local congregations and circuits to use in their territories.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> During December all congregations will be working to reach their 10 per cent increase in publishers. To reach this goal will require each publisher to manifest to the full his appreciation for privileges of Kingdom service and also to take advantage of opportunities to assist others. Servants will need to organize congregation activity so that all publishers have a share in field service and new ones are started in the ministry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> On the first of December the assistant congregation servant should prepare for each study conductor a list of those who did not report field service during November. Study conductors will arrange for immediate assistance to be given to these publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Let all associated share in the field service by the fifteenth of the month. At that time the assistant congregation servant will again check his records and see who have not yet published. In a spirit of love study conductors will be supplied another list. They will either arrange personally to give assistance to those who have been unable to publish up to that point in December or assign other mature brothers to do so.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">All brothers who received Class 1-0 from local boards and, on appeal, Class I-A or I-A-0 from the appeal board should write to Hayden Covington, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York, for a memorandum. You must enclose a self-addressed envelope with proper return postage on it.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark32"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">arrangements should be made to assist all publishers to share in the ministry. This is vital, for some, especially persons of good will, may not be assigned to work with a companion. Study conductors and other publishers will need to lend a helping hand so that these are aided to share in making public declaration. This assistance, of course, should be given not only during December but regularly every month.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> This year we are in fine position to reach and even exceed our 10 per cent increase. The training program has aided many brothers to advance to maturity and become more effective in the field. The good news of the Kingdom has been preached with greater effectiveness, and persons of good will have responded in ever-in-creasing numbers. But full co-operation will be needed if we are to reach the 10 per cent increase by the end of December. Servants will need to organize congregation activity and take the lead in field service. The congregation servant should closely supervise arrangements made to aid all publishers, and each one of us as a publisher must co-operate and do his share. If we work diligently to share in theocratic increase, Jehovah gives the promise that he will bless our efforts to meet the desired goal. We look forward to receiving December's congregation monthly report cards and noting your happy expression : “We made it 1”</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>400,000 New Subscriptions?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> True to his promise, Jehovah, aS the great Shepherd, is now gathering the scattered sheep. He has commanded his Shepherd-Prince, Christ Jesus, to gather the sheep from all nations into the one fold. (Ezek. 34: 23, 24, AS) Serving under and with the Shepherd-Prince in the pastoral work is the “faithful and discreet slave,” along with the thousands of other sheep that have already been gathered. Not content just to be gathered themselves, they extend the invitation to others: “ ‘Come I’ And . . . take life’s water free.”—Rev. 22:17, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Faithfully, since 1879, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> has been used to announce Jehovah’s kingdom and promote the gathering work. During January and February the total of 183,127 new subscriptions were obtained in the United States, and each day throughout March thousands more have come into the office. The big question, “Shall we meet the quota of 400,000 for the campaign?” will be determined </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">by our activity this month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">More House-to-House Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Most of the new subscriptions will be obtained in house-to-house work. Spend the maximum number of hours in this service during April, presenting a year's subscription for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> for $1, with three of the older booklets you have in stock as the premium. Prepare a three- to eight-minute talk on a theme highlighted in the issue presented. It is very effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> April concludes the 16th </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> campaign. Let each publisher, pioneer and congregation work to make it the greatest campaign month for new subscriptions. In addition to house-to-house work, make return calls where subscriptions are promised. Be one who shares fully In pastoral work with the Shepherd-Prince during April.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Memorial Activity</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> On Saturday, April 17, after 6 p.m., Standard Time, the memorial of Christ’s death will be observed. The faithful remnant will be present and with them thousands of goodwill companions. On that occasion we shall witness a great demonstration of the extent to which the pastoral work has progressed. All persons of good will should be given personal invitations, wherever possible, and, where necessary, assisted to attend this most important event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Each congregation should make advance arrangements now for Memorial week activity. A special service meeting will be programed for that week and service arrangements clearly outlined. Saturday morning and afternoon house-to-house and store-to-store magazine work will be featured and Sunday’s public talk advertised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> At least a half hour before the Memorial service starts, the hall should be open and several publishers present to welcome all who attend. The speaker, in concluding the discourse, will highlight the importance of preaching and invite all present to share in Kingdom service the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* Sunday will feature house-to-house witnessing, followed by a public talk and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study in the afternoon or evening. Use the Kingdom Hall as the contact point. If it is not convenient for all to meet there, congregation book study locations may be used. A brief program may be arranged for Sunday morning. Arrange to be at the first door by 10 a.m. Encourage and help persons of good will to participate in field service with you. Explain the Importance of reporting and invite them to report the time that they spend in the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Circuit Servant’s Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Congregations privileged to have </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font7"> j, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Shall We Make It?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> If each one does his share and co-operates fully </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">we can</span><span class="font7"> make the 20 per cent increase. The potential is present and Jehovah assures he will bless our faithful service. What we need to do is to aid all associated persons and those who are studying to share in the preaching work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> To assist all servants, pioneers and publishers to co-ordinate their efforts in reaching the 20 per cent peak, the following suggestions are given. 1. A list of all who did not publish during March will be given to study conductors. They will see that these are given assistance at the beginning of April. All associated</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> ONES SHOULD ARRANGE TO SHARE IN THE FIELD WORK BY THE 11TH AND PROMPTLY REPORT. 2. </span><span class="font7">A list of those who have not preached by the 11th will be given to study conductors. This will let them know who still need assistance. Arrange </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TO TAKE PART AND ASSIST OTHERS TO SHARE IN THE FIELD WORK BY THE </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">18th. 3. If any have not reported by the 18th, congregation servants will notify study conductors. Special plans will be made to help them into the service during the remainder of the month. Use the training program throughout April and thereafter.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Start New Publishers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Thousands of persons have had home Bible studies for many months, and, in some eases, for several years, without publishing. Both study and service are necessary for life. Tactfully help these to start preaching this month and to continue right on into the new world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Shall we reach the 20 per cent increase and have 167,959 preaching? It depends upon each one of us. Let us work hard, each one publish, aid others and pray to Jehovah to grant this rich increase. The Society awaits your report card showing “We Made It I”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">More Ministers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the service year of 1953 a grand total of 519,982 different individuals had a part in Kingdom service. Virtually all 143 lands reported marvelous increases. Consider below a few examples of theocratic increase and how these came about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Costa Rica a woman was continually heard to add to her daily rosary prayer: “Lord, save us from ‘los atala-yas’ ” (as Jehovah’s witnesses have been dubbed there). Her prayer was sincere and having a proper heart condition she accepted the truth brought to her by one engaged in pastoral work to become one of the 519,982 proclaimerg of good news. (129)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Have you talked the truth to your relatives and made an effort to assist them in Kingdom service? A brother in the Sudan neglected to do so himself, but now will heartily recommend that you never say about your relatives, “I’ll just let them find out for themselves. They wouldn’t listen to me anyway.” (146) Try to help them understand the truth. Maybe they; will listen and even start preaching with you during April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do you conduct one or more home Bible studies? Have you assisted the individuals to join in the preaching work? Do not wait for them to say, “Brother, I would like to go out preaching with you.’’ (165) On hearing and learning the truth, the other sheep gladly respond to share in Kingdom service. Within three weeks from starting to study a young man in Australia asked to go out witnessing. (89, 90) Why not ask and help the one you are studying with to join in the ministry this month?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through the medium of public meetings many persons have become acquainted with the truth. It is an effective means of advertising the Kingdom and, as illustrated in the 1954 “Yearbook,” they may profitably be held at locations in addition to the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Philippine Islands a congregation arranged to witness in unassigned territory Among the blessings that resulted was 400 attending a public meeting requested by the mayor. (232, 233) Another interesting experience was enjoyed by a group working unassigned territory in Mexico. (199, 200)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the delivery of a public talk in the Gold Coast, a church bell rang. After the talk a person inquired why the church uses a bell. Read the answer on page 163 and also the effect one public talk may have on a person of good will, even an ardent Catholic. Brothers, are you thoroughly preparing your public talks?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Theaters, halls and other locations are often made available to us free for public lectures, when the owner understands the purpose of our work. A special pioneer had such an experience in El Salvador and a few days later gave an open-air talk in the public cemetery, with 400 in attendance. (148)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Who are Jehovah’s witnesses? So interested to find out were people in an isolated section of Costa Rica that some walked ten miles to hear the talk. The hall was not large enough to accommodate all desiring to listen. To learn what happened see pages 129 and 130.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Often in presenting the message to householders we are confronted with stock answers developed to evade salesmen. Realizing householders do not always immediately understand the purpose of our call, we tactfully endeavor to Overcome the barriers they raise by making known the importance of our visit as ministers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> For example, after the initial introduction and presentation they might say, “I’m sorry, but not this time.” To answer this objection we might reply, “I should like to explain that I am a minister. This work is not commercial. Its purpose is to help people learn of God’s kingdom and how essential it is that we understand God’s requirements to live under the Kingdom rule. It has brought great comfort to me to learn of the Kingdom and I would be happy to discuss It with you for a few moments.” Then quickly go into your three- to eight-minute talk, stressing the importance of gaining accurate knowledge of God’s kingdom and pointing out the value of the literature as a Bible study aid.</span></p></li>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">From Home Bible Student to Publisher</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I (4 mm.) </span><span class="font4">Talk on aiding good-will persons having Bible studies to gain life by helping them become preachers. Each month there were, on the average, 87,858 home Bible studies conducted in the United States during 1953, but only an increase of 13,340 in average number of publishers. Locally, in our congregation there were _____</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">home Bible studies and____new pub</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">lishers. Many are yet to be started in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE II (4 min.) Publisher interrupts: “How can they be started?” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Discussion ensues</span><span class="font4"> with speaker making helpful suggestions. While conducting studies highlight service as material lends itself and explain the privilege and responsibility of preaching. Relate experiences and joys of service. Take good-will person to congregation book study and Kingdom Hall meetings. Many are willing and desirous of joining in the preaching, needing only the conductor’s invitation and assistance. Upon expressing desire to see how it can be done, publisher is invited by speaker to look in on Brother Progressive concluding weekly study in “Let God Be True” with Mr. Sincere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE III (4 min.) </span><span class="font4">Mr. Sincere reads last paragraph in chapter “A Ransom in Exchange for Many” and comments that lesson helped him understand the subject for the first time. Brother </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Progressive alertly ties this in </span><span class="font4">with service, pointing out how fortunate they are to understand such important things. Many do not and must be helped, for the ransom is for many. “It is our privilege to tell them by going to their homes as I’m planning to do this Sunday morning,” he continues. “Wouldn’t you like to come with me?” Mr. Sincere replies that from studying the Bible he knows preaching is necessary, but, not knowing exactly what to say, he is a little frightened. Brother Progressive says he will do the talking and Mr. Sincere can go along to see how it is done, considering it part of his Bible education. Mr. Sincere agrees to go. Definite arrangements are made to pick him up Sunday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE IV (8 min.) </span><span class="font4">Before going to the first door, Brother Progressive briefly reviews offer and points made at contact point for more effective preaching. At the door he introduces himself and companion and then presents offer, using three- to eightminute talk. The householder accepts offer and Progressive then gives householder an invitation to public talk. Mr. Sincere speaks up to comment how interesting the talks are. On </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">leaving, </span><span class="font4">Brother Progressive remarks how helpful Mr. Sincere’s comment was and then arranges for him to extend handbill invitation at next door. He is enthused to have part and expresses joy of going along in the service and appreciation for being invited. He wonders if it will ever be possible for him to do as well as Brother Progressive. Being assured that with training it will, the two proceed to next door, with new publisher eager to learn more about preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Doing Pastoral Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I (3 min.) </span><span class="font4">Conductor talks on engaging in pastoral work with the Shepherd-Prince. Pastoral work includes caring for the sheep by training them. To do this we have to lead them step by step and not only show them, but actually help them to do the things we do. Even if we make an excellent presentation ourselves, we have not trained them. How would you like to sit down and have a music teacher play an hour of beautiful music and then turn and ask you, a novice, to do the same? Would she really be a teacher? Let us </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">see how this idea</span><span class="font4"> works out in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE II (4 min,) Publisher takes new person in work. She goes to door and makes very good presentation of “The Watchtower.” Good-will person listens, remarks how well publisher did in her presentation. Then publisher says: “It’s easy. How about you taking the next house?” Good-will person declines, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not being</span><span class="font4"> capable or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">doing as </span><span class="font4">publisher did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE III (4 min.) </span><span class="font4">Publisher is called on by servant checking to see how she is progressing with good-will person. Publisher says she does not seem to succeed in getting good-will person or others to go on their own, even after a long time. Servant explains they must be trained step by step. Show them how to record </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">results </span><span class="font4">on House-to-House Record; give them a Scripture text to have ready to read when called for and, on conclusion of witness, have them give householder a handbill and invite him to attend talk, etc. As new ones progress, additional parts of the witness may be given to them, and before long they will be trained to effectively present the message alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE IV (6 min,) </span><span class="font4">Publisher again takes the good-will person into the service, after preparing her to read a scripture and to extend an invitation to the talk. At first home the good-will person is called upon at proper time to read the scripture. Going to next home publisher tells the good-will person she did fine and at next door may offer the handbill at conclusion of witness. This is done and on their way to the next door the good-will person expresses joy over being able to share in the preaching work. She wants to learn how to give a good, complete witness at the door and looks forward to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">time </span><span class="font4">when she will be able to go on her own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE V </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font4"> min.) In conclusion conductor points out how results are obtained by this method. Remember, we are ministerial teachers training these people for the highest profession Let us take more care than the best music teacher would to see that they are given a foundation training, so they will stay in the service of God and become exemplary ministers to others </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">seeking life.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Unassigned Territory to Be Worked</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">As a result of the unassigned territory campaigns of 1952 and 1953, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">most of the</span><span class="font7"> unassigned territory in the United States was worked. Thousands were privileged to become acquainted with the truth and over thirty new congregations were started. In 1954 the months of July and August will find us again busy calling on people in unassigned territory talking about the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is still much work to be done in unassigned territory and all congregations are encouraged to share in the work this summer. With district assemblies arranged for all</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Plan </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Four</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Days</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Assemblies always mean a special portion of Jehovah’s blessing. A well-planned program provides a feast abundantly spread. An unusual feature of the 1954 District Assemblies is that they are not three days as generally scheduled, but </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">four.</span><span class="font7"> The additional day is Thursday, which means assemblies start one day earlier. The extra day will provide additional important counsel and instruction for the New World society. The time to be at a district assembly, then, is from Thursday morning through Sunday evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> These copiously supplied feasts are not only for publishers and their families, but also persons of good will. Include them in your plans this year. By seeing and hearing firsthand, and feeling directly the zeal, spirit and enthusiasm of the New World society, they will appreciate the unity and magnitude of its operation, as well as the devotion of true worshipers of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> With this </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font7"> a letter giving general assembly information, as well as the Room Request and Volunteer Service forms, is being sent to each congregation. You will find an assembly reasonably close to where you are located, so travel will not he much of a problem. Start thinking, talking, planning, saving and working toward attending.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Do you debate whether or not to eat when hungry and food is available? Of course not, for food is necessary to sustain life. Spiritual food is even more important, so do not debate whether or not to attend a district assembly all </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">four</span><span class="font7"> days this summer. Start arranging now and then when the time comes—attend.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">to attend with limited travel, undoubtedly most congregations will be able to have as full a part in the work as they did in 1952. Remember, too, entire families may vacation pioneer for two, three or more weeks in unassigned territory as well as with a congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With this </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font7"> the Society Is sending a new unassigned territory book and an unassigned territory application. Look over the territory, make your selection and return the application by April 15. With all servants, pioneers and publishers supporting this campaign, thousands more in unassigned territory will be assisted this summer to learn of Jehovah’s new world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Christ Jesus was very careful to make his disciples aware that it is better to give than to receive. In discussing this matter, Paul pointed out that one manifestation of this was to aid those who are weaker, aiding them to find the greater happiness in giving.—Acts 20:35, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p></li>

Congregation book study conductors will please keep a record of those who engage in house-to-house work between the 1st and the 18th and inform the congregation servant so he can report on the card the total number of house-to-house publishers during this period. This will include those who participate in house-to-house work alone or who share in giving the witness while accompanying another for training. Work toward the goal of 100 per cent or “Every Publisher a Regular House-to-House Preacher of Good News!” by the 18th of April.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">CONGREGATION</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Welcoming Strangers</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> As more and more of the other sheep are found, new faces will appear at organized meetings. These persons of good will should be made to feel welcome. They will not be acquainted with God’s people as a group and will observe very intently what goes on. Their first impression should be a good one. For that reason all should know how to treat strangers when they come to meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> The congregation book study location often serves as the first contact the stranger has with Jehovah’s visible organization. A friendly, receptive spirit should be displayed by the brothers at the study. After the conductor is introduced to the stranger, he should acquaint the group with the newcomer and also aid the person of good will to feel at ease and to know that he is welcome. An interesting, friendly, informal study will serve as an added inducement for the stranger to come again.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> When attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall the stranger should be made to feel welcome and at home. Servants and publishers will take the initiative to greet newcomers, introduce the stranger to others,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">point out things of interest at the Kingdom Hall, such as the yeartext, library, stock room where literature can be obtained, the advertising department, etc. Love is further shown by sitting with the stranger during the meeting, sharing songbook, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> etc., telling him of other meetings and inviting him to return. If such an atmosphere of welcome prevails, the stranger will feel like returning again and partaking of the lifegiving knowledge dispensed at meetings. A stranger should be a stranger only once and that only on his first visit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Special occasions, such as the visit of the circuit servant or at Memorial time, afford an excellent opportunity to put into practice a warm Christian welcome. Many persons of good will attend these meetings. They should be properly welcomed to these as to all other meetings. Several mature publishers might be specially assigned by the congregation servant to be on the watch for strangers and to welcome them. An all-out effort should be made </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font7"> aid the stranger to associate himself regularly. It is necessary to become a strong, active worshiper of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> ‘‘Have the desirable things . . . of all nations come in?&quot; This was the timely query placed by Brother Kranz before 131,419 assembled at Yankee Stadium in 1953. Then came his thrilling invitation to those of I he anointed remnant in attendance: &quot;Lift up your eyes and sweep them about this vast structure of Yankee Stadium and behold the tens on tens of thousands of people of good will from scores of nations and languages.” The significance of this stirring spectacle was made known with the ringing declaration that there was “the answer of Jehovah of hosts to the question.” Yes, “the desire of all nations” had come in, with the bright prospect of many more precious ones joining the happy throng in further fulfillment of Haggai 2 : 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Desiring to share in aiding the remaining desirable ones of all nations to come in, Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide will preach at every opportunity during November. Publishers may use the offer of their choice, as follows: Three books and three booklets on a contribution of $1.50 or the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font3"> of either the Hebrew or the Greek Scriptures and a book on a contribution of $2. Regardless of the offer used, all publishers will want to use their Bibles in giving appropriate three- to eight-minute sermons.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">An Additional Opportunity</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> “Thanksgiving Day” opens an added opportunity for many publishers to enjoy field service privileges. Most brothers will be free from their secular jobs. The day may well be completely dedicated by all to field service. It is suggested that each congregation make special group witnessing arrangements “Thanksgiving Day.” Many congregations that have done so have written in unusual experiences. This year the Society would like to receive from congregation servants any report they might like to make covering outstanding field service results or unusual experiences publishers might have witnessing “Thanksgiving Day.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Back-Call, Home Bible Study Service</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> As</span><span class="font3"> highlighted in the article in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant—</span><span class="font3">“Needed: More to Feed the Sheep”—back-call and home Bible study activity should be given greater attention. Are you spending at least two hours in house-to-house work on Sunday and then an hour or more making back-calls? And, of course, with our goal being home Bible studies, why not conduct a home Bible study following the back-call work? This will enable you to take part in house-to-house witnessing, then make some back-calls and end your field service for the day with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font3">Bible study. Attending the public talk and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study thereafter will round out a wholesome day of theocratic activity. This good schedule is recommended for all.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> During the last two years particular stress has been given to our goal: “Every publisher a regular house-to-house preacher of good news.” In virtually every congregation splendid progress has been made as you brothers have seen the need for more house-to-house service and have responded to the Society’s call for greater activity. Approximately 80 per cent of the total publishers (which includes physically handicapped, newly interested ones, children, etc.) now engage in the house-to-house ministry, with the vast majority using three- to eight-minute sermons with good effect. It is very pleasing to observe the fine progress that has been made. Well done, publishers, pioneers and servants!</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> While all of us will want to continue engaging regularly in the house-to-house ministry, giving three- to eight-minute sermons and assisting others in this basic part of the min-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">Orders may be placed now for the 1955 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> and calendar. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> is 50 cents a copy. Calendars are 25 cents each, or five or more to one address for 20 cents each. Publishers are requested to order through the congregation. Pioneers on the list before July 1, 1954, should register with the congregation stock servant to receive a free copy of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font3"> The stock servant will keep this list and take it into consideration when ordering the congregation supply of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook. </span><span class="font3">He will check off the names of pioneers as he gives out copies. Congregations will submit a Literature Credit Request form the usual way for copies of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> placed with pioneers. Pioneers not associated with a congregation will receive their </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> direct from the Society, if eligible. Pioneers starting on or afte&quot; July 1, 1954, will not be eligible for a free copy of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">istry, we must continue expanding our ministry and give greater attention to the back-call and home Bible study work. The very purpose of our house-to-house ministry is to make placements so that return calls can be made to start home Bible studies. Therefore, in addition to continuing and improving the fine house-to-house work being done, let us increase our ministerial activity by devoting additional hours to the back-call and home Bible study service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Need Is Evident</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Just what are the facts that point to the need for greater back-call and Bible study activity? The Society has made a spot check in a section of the United States where congregation averages (hours, back-calls and home Bible studies) are well above those for the nation. The result was this: Only </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">22 per cent</span><span class="font3"> of the publishers engaged in back-call activity regularly. An additional </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">35 per cent</span><span class="font3"> made a few</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah's Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Harvest is Great</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The harvest was great in Jesus* day but it is even greater today since he is enthroned as King. We are privileged to share in the harvest work by first planting and then by making return calls on interested persons, having in mind starting home Bible studies. Through these Bible studies more laborers for the joyful harvest result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another laborer in Belgium now enjoys a part in the harvest work through —yes—-attending a home Bible study. His motive in first attending was not right, but his heart condition was, as you will read on page 99.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Western Samoa much harvesting work is in progress. Preaching the good news of the Kingdom is relatively new there, but the interest is-great. It is very common to arrange Bible studies with two or three persons and upon arrival to find ten to forty persons waiting, curious to hear Jehovah’s Word. (94)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What arrangements can be made if conditions in a home will not permit a Bible study? Why, other suitable locations can be used—even a public park, as was done in Pakistan—with fine results. If people really wish to study, a tactful publisher can arrange a place for the study to be held. (225)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May a new publisher conduct home Bible studies? Most assuredly, and he should, as shown by what resulted in New Zealand. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font2"> new publisher there assisted a youthful Presbyterian to learn more Bible truth in two weeks than he had in going to church for years. So do not hold back, you who are new or you who have published for years. Conduct one or more home Bible studies and enjoy having a part in assisting others to share in the harvest. (205, 206)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">More Aided</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Proverbs 2: 1-5 we read: Tf one seeks after knowledge and understanding as diligently as for silver and gold, then one will find the knowledge of God.’ By faithfully carrying out their ministry Jehovah’s witnesses, as shown in the “Yearbook,” were privileged to aid many last year to find and understand the knowledge of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even among the clergy? Yes, even a Roman Catholic priest in El Salvador. (148) Also, you will enjoy the report, on page 111, of the butcher in Britain who passed on to a church warden more Bible knowledge in a few minutes than he had heard in twenty-five years of churchgoing. The church warden is now able to aid others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Continually seeking to aid more, Jehovah’s witnesses call from house to house delivering three- to eightminute sermons and endeavor to place with interested persons printed Bible sermons for further study. Many unusual experiences are encountered, such as that of a publisher in Eire. (112) Speaking of house-to-house work, can a territory be covered too often? Hardly, is the reply on page 118, which tells of two families (now publishers) who had not been properly contacted in territory covered several times a year. This brings to our attention again the need for keeping a House-to-House Record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some zealous brothers in Nyasaland wondered how they could aid European women to find the knowledge of God without offending them. They worked out a plan that was very effective and that has resulted In at least one more adding others. (223)</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The months of November and December present Jehovah's witnesses with a wonderful opportunity to continue using Bible themes when presenting the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font3"> of the Hebrew or the Greek Scriptures. Scriptures used in three-to eight-minute sermons can effectively be read from the translation of the Bible we are trying to place. By now, each publisher has several sermons that may be used in presenting the Greek Scriptures. If you wish to present the Hebrew Scriptures you might use this one, which has the theme “Obedience Leads to Life”:</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> “Good morning. We are calling on people this morning with vital and comforting information. Today the earth is bathed in wickedness and suffering. Many people say that this is the way God purposed it to be and it will never he any different. Yet you, no doubt, have wondered if this is what a loving God has provided for his people and just why conditions are so bad today. To get an answer to these questions we can go right to God's Word, the Bible. In the very first chapter | read Genesis 1: 28, 31] it shows man was given a good start. Where, then, did all this wickedness come from? The Bible tells us that man was disobedient and God sentenced him to death.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">The Right Attitude Toward Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(4 min.) Bible study servant, speaking on need of each publisher's conducting a Bible study, points out that increase in New World society comes largely through regular, systematic care that good-will persons receive through studies. Most of us learned the truth this way and appreciated loving assistance rendered. Necessity is laid upon us to share knowledge with others. Much literature is placed, but records show that studies are conducted by only a few publishers (Local figures may be used here.) The right mental attitude toward weekly studies with persons of good will is required for each publisher to recognize his responsibility. Just last week this problem was discussed; watch what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(10 min.) Bible study servant, returning from home Bible study just started, stops at a servant’s home and finds family lounging before television set. After greetings he enthusiastically tells them of his joyful experience in starting new study and how others studied with are progressing and appreciate knowledge received. Then he relates sadly that he has found other good-will persons that would enjoy a study, but there are no publishers to care for them. Many brothers are capable, but they just are not conducting studies. He wonders if servant or his wife has any ideas on how publishers can be made to understand their responsibility toward conducting studies. Both sympathize with him and make expressions like these: All should feel and act upon responsibilities of feeding sheep through studies’; ‘planting requires cultivating’; ‘some put personal pleasures ahead of aiding others’; ‘better budgeting of time might eliminate any real or imagined obstacles’; and ‘publishers just do not recognize joy of helping “young children” grow.’ Conversation concludes and Bible study servant leaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(4 min.) Brother asks wife when she last had study. Hesitatingly she recalls “it w’as quite some time ago.” Brother shamefacedly mentions that he too has been lax in this and has not held a study for “nearly a year.” Both express regret over their neglect and appreciate call of the Bible study servant, which has made them conscious of their shortcomings. He knows where he can start a study and she will take one from Bible study servant. Both will start studies right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(2 min.) Bible study servant sums up points. He suggests all do some soul-searching to see if they are neglecting their responsibility. He offers assistance if needed and encourages each to conduct at least one Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Preparing and Using Back-Call Sermons</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This demonstration, which will take up most of a service meeting, should be well-planned and rehearsed under the supervision of the congregation servant and Bible study servant. Make it effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (4 min.) Introduction: Back-calls that will become Bible studies must be thought out and planned. Publisher must have the material he wishes to convey in mind and take the initiative on the call. Here is where ten- to fifteen-minute back-call sermons come in. Are they difficult to prepare and to use? Let us see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (15 min.) Bible study servant calls on No-Study, tactfully bringing out that he does well in service, makes good placements, but has no Bible studies and makes few back-calls. No-Study replies that he uses three- to eight-minute sermon at doors with success. How about back-call sermons? No, he has not prepared or tried them. Servant expresses need for return visits and starting of Bible studies. No-Study acknowledges need, then frankly states he does not know how to prepare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ten- to</span><span class="font2"> fifteen-minute sermon. Servant suggests they prepare one to use- No-Study gets House-to-House Record and recalls sermon used in placing “New Heavens and a New Barth”. (First sermon—“Your Service Meeting”—May “Informant”) New-world theme was used; householder was particularly impressed with conditions to be on eartn when Rev. 21: 1, 4,5 reaches fulfillment. “Good,” says servant. “That is our </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">starting- point </span><span class="font2">then. Let’s prepare a sermon using ‘Make Sure of All Things’.” Subject “Earth and Its Destiny” is used. Servant and No-Study develop the following very simple but forceful back-call sermon outlined by selecting points from “Make Sure of All Things”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Introduction: (Theme: New world, Rev. 21: 1, 4, 5)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. God’s purpose toward earth Gen. 1: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">28; Isa. 45: 18</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2">2. Literal earth to be permanent Ps. 78: 69; Eccl. 1:4</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. What will be destroyed</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Isa. 13: 9; Rev. 11: 18; Jer. 25: 31, 33</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">4. Earth to be a paradise Isa. 35: 1, 2, 7</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5. Man to enjoy perfection and blessings Isa. 33: 24; Ps. 46: 9</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Conclusion: God’s original purpose fulfilled Rev. 21: 1-5 (Lead Into “New Heavens and a New Earth” book.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Servant illustrates to No-Study how conclusion of sermon leads right into first paragraph of book and a study can be started. No-Study is amazed with simplicity of preparing sermon. Servant asks No-Study to accompany him on call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (15 min.) Bible study servant and No-Study call on “New Heavens and a New Earth” placement. Bible study servant uses outline in giving sermon; scriptures are read from Bible. On conclusion, first paragraph in book is referred to and considered in study manner. After another paragraph is discussed householder expresses appreciation for points learned. Alert servant suggests householder continue reading next few pages and says that they will return next week for further discussion. The result: A Bible study is started. After leaving, No-Study mentions to servant his appreciation for being assisted to prepare back-call sermon and to see how effective they are when used. Now he can enjoy preparing and using them on back-calls, just as he enjoys using sermons in house-to-house work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE IV (4 min.) Summarize easy-to-prepare ten- to fifteen-minute back-call sermons, their effectiveness, need for all to use them and to increase back-call and home Bible study activity.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> And what does the analysis show for home Bible studies? Approximately </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">8 per cent</span><span class="font3"> conduct home Bible studies each month, another 1.9 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">per cent</span><span class="font3"> spasmodically, from time to time, leaving the very high percentage of 73 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">per cent</span><span class="font3"> of all publishers, who do not engage in home Bible study work at all. These figures include all servants and congregation book study conductors, some of whom have not been sharing in Bible study work. Is it not evident, Kingdom publishers,- that many more should be sharing in the back-call and Bible study work?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Organizing for Greater Activity</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The sobering figures above, in which the Society feels all of you will be keenly interested because they apply to obligations resting upon every dedicated servant of Jehovah, bring to our attention the need for each publisher to consider carefully how he might improve and increase his back-eali and Bible study work. It is these features of the service we shall want to build up during the coming months, as we </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">continue to maintain our rery fine regular participation in house-to-house icitness-ing, using three- to eight-minute sermons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> It is suggested that all congregation servants and book study conductors in each congregation meet within a week or two after receipt of this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> and discuss ways and means of coping with the problem of how back-call and Bible studywork can be increased locally. It would be good for the congregation servant, assistant congregation servant and Bible study servant to get together to check the records carefully and discuss points that might be brought to the attention of the servants and study conductors at this meeting. Highlight back-call and Bible study work on the service meeting. Organize a regular hackcall night from each service center. Arrange for an hour or so to be spent making back-calls on Sunday </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">after </span><span class="font3">two or more hours in regular house-to-house witnessing with the current offer. Back-call work cau also be done during the week. Publishers assisting others in house-to-house work will assist those with whom they are working to make back-calls and conduct Bible studies.

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Centuries were used in preparing it! It is to be an everlasting praise to its Creator! Now we are living in it! What a grand privilege to be a part of the Society that is most precious to Jehovah and dear to the hearts of his servants. All who are in it will live forever to praise Jehovah. But it must be the most important thing in our lives. We must live now as a New World society. —Matt. 19: 28, 29, .V1V, margin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> An essential of living now as a New World society is accurate knowledge of its requirements. You have it: others need it to live. So plan your schedule for December to take that knowledge to all who want to learn of the way to life. Offer them three books and three booklets on a contribution of $1.50, or. if you prefer. a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font3"> (either Greek or Hebrew Scriptures) and a book for $2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Be sure to make a notation on your House-to-House Record of all interested persons thatyou find. Then make return visits to strengthen and stimulate their interest. Increase your back-call activity, remembering back-calls are steppingstones to Bible studies through which persons learn how to live as a New World society.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Each congregation, as the local center of new-world living, will organize its activity during December to aid all associated to praise Jeho-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">back-call and Bible study activity, before long many more publishers will expand their ministry to include these features of the service and thus be of greater assistance to the multitude whom they are privileged to assist into the New World society. Seeing this great need, let all of us increase our back-call and home Bible study activity. It will result in more of the other sheep being properly fed and nourished in the way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Month by month through the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> the Society will continue to offer suggestions and counsel that will help all publishers as they expand their ministry, regularly sharing, not only in finding the sheep in house-to-house witnessing, but also in feeding those found, through the back-call and home Bible study work. Will you be one who responds to the need of the &quot;other sheep”? vah during the month. To achieve our goal of a 10 per cent increase in publishers this month all must do their part. As a dedicated servant put forth an extra effort to make December an outstanding month of praise. By each one’s appreciating his responsibility as a member of the New World society every congregation will be able to mark its December report, “We Made It!”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Ten- to Fifteen-Minute Sermons on Back-Calls</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The primary purpose of our ministry, that of finding and feeding the Lord’s other sheep, should never be lost sight of. That is why we devote time to house-to-house work. But our feeding work does not stop there. It has only begun. We plant the seed of God's Word when we give three- to eight-minute sermons, place literature or otherwise stimulate interest. We must cultivate this interest if it is to grow to maturity and in turn &quot;bear fruit with endurance.”—Luke 8: 15, A<sup>T</sup>iy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> How can we best follow up the interest shown? Ten- to fifteen-minute Bible sermons on back-calls are the answer! Just as we prepare to give three-to eight-minute sermons in door-to-door activity, preparation is needed before making return visits. First of all, a proper House-to-House Record must be kept of placements and outstanding interest. Brief notations can be made on it of the theme used in your three- to eightminute sermon and of points of particular interest to the householder. With this basic information you can </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">prepare to make an effective</span><span class="font3"> back-call.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">How It May Be Done</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Just as in preparing three- to eight-minute sermons, first of all select a theme on which to base your ten- to fifteen-minute sermons. You might use themes dealing with the Kingdom, destiny of the earth, educating ourselves on life, peace, etc. Some publishers have very effectively enlarged on the theme of their three-to eight-minute sermons, working in different scriptures so as to elaborate on the subject in which the householder showed interest. Where interest is expressed in a particular subject (meaning of world events,</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">A limited number of 1954 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> cloth-bound volumes are still available. If you desire one or both of these volumes please order right away. Each volume is available at $2.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Vacation Pioneering</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Do you have a vacation in December? If so, remember you can now be a vacation pioneer for two weeks. A vacation pioneer application will be sent to you on request.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">condition of the dead, etc.) prepare accordingly.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> With the subject in mind you will be able to select appropriate scriptures. Use </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things&quot; </span><span class="font3">together with the Bible or other sources, such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font3">books and booklets of the Society, etc., for obtaining the information you wish. Generally, five to ten scriptures will suffice, depending on the subject and your comments. All that is necessary now is a few well-chosen introductory and concluding remarks. In concluding have in mind leading the interested person into one of the publications where more information on the subject is available. Often a study can be started on the first'or second call.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Use the Bible in giving ten- to fifteen-minute Bible sermons. You might make a brief outline and keep it handy for reference. In fact, since ten- to fifteen-minute sermons may be used more than once, just as three- to eight-minute sermons are, it is good to keep them. Start out with one or two and gradually build the number up so you have several to use. Ten- to fifteen-minute sermons are easy to prepare and a pleasure to use, just as the three- to eight-minute sermons are.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> In making return calls the publishers must tactfully lead the discussions for best results. So be prepared. &quot;The heart of the righteous studieth to answer.” (Prov. 15:28) Remember, your objective is making back-calls to start home Bible studies. The interest you stimulate on the first few calls will usually determine whether or not you will be able to start a home Bible study. Use your Bible effectively in giving ten- to fifteen-minute sermons on back-calls and thereby have a greater share in feeding the sheep that the Great Shepherd is gathering into his New World society today.</span></p></li></ul>

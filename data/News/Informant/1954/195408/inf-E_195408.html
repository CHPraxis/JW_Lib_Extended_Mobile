<p><span class="font5">ADDED AIDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Have you developed several three-to eight-minute sermons? Are you using them in witnessing from house to house? Do you support points in your sermon </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">hy rending scriptures </span><span class="font4">from the Bible? All publishers are encouraged to do so, for using short sermons is proving to be the most effective means of conveying Bible truths to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As an aid to developing more seven- to eight-minute sermons, commencing with the August 15th issue and appearing in the September, October and November issues, the first article in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> will be a short sermon. It will contain material that you can use effectively in sermons from house to house after you say your usual “Good morning” and brief introduction. By condensing the material into outline form and listing the scriptures you want to read to support the major points you will have a variety of sermons to use; in fact, seven different ones. Take advantage of these added aids which will assist you to give better and more sermons. On service meetings during these four months congregation servants might well arrange for publishers to prepare and give sample sermons from these articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Undoubtedly you have also noted, starting with the July 1st issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and the July 8th</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Bethel Family Field Record Good</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">All Jehovah’s slaves in the New World society will be interested in knowing some of the things Brother Knorr recently wrote to the 75 branch offices concerning the Bethel family’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">field</span><span class="font4"> service report, so here are a few excerpts from his letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“All of us w'ho have the opportunity of working in the Bethel homes, either In Brooklyn or at branch offices, certainly appreciate the wonderful treasure of service that is ours . . . taking care of correspondence, shipping literature, doing home duties, cooking and laundry.” He also said: “They rejoice in the opportunity of going out in the field service with their fellow workers preaching this good news of the Kingdom. The Bethel family in every country is looked to by local publishers to set the example in leadership.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He then mentioned that it was not only the work in the Bethel home that counted but also field service was necessary to give the individual a good standing before Jehovah. In this connection he said : “I took occasion to check the hours of every member of the Bethel family, of which there are approximately 400 here now, who are assigned either with the Brooklyn Heights unit or with other units throughout the city; and I compiled the averages of hours, back-calls and Bible studies. During the months of April and May there were 414 members in the family and they averaged the following in hours, back-calls and Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">(Jnassrgned Territory Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s blessing<sup>-</sup> has been richly manifest upon the diligent effort of congregation publishers and pioneers to witness in unassigned territory since the inauguration of this special work in 1952. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">To observe the</span><span class="font2"> far-reaching effects, note a few of the many “Yearbook” experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Working unassigned territory in Newfoundland the brothers were greeted with expressions like: “Have you any more of those good books?” “Oh, you’re here at last!” “You might just as well stop here until you teach us the right way. We want to know how io get everlasting life.” (213) These expressions certainly indicate that the “other sheep” are eagerly awaiting the truth of God's Word It is no wonder, then, that the brothers put forth much effort in the various countries, such as in British Honduras, to work unassigned territory Here much more is required than settling comfortably in an auto and driving to the territory, but the brothers are happy to do it in order to reach the sheep &lt;108, 109)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This year, as last year, many congregations will receive the same assignments and thus return to areas previously worked. In Argentina an effort was made to return personally to the homes previously visited, with good results. (86, 87) This shows the merit of calling on persons whose slips the Society sends out with a congregation’s assignment. And just what may have happened since literature was left the previous year? Perhaps your experience will be a joyful one, similar to that on page 246.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Travel Witnessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many times in traveling the opportunity </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">is presented to talk the</span><span class="font2"> truth and witness to others. By talking to the one traveling next to you, by bus, boat, train or other ways, you might have experiences such as these taken from the 1954 “Yearbook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Homeward bound from the New York convention a New Zealand pioneer spoke to a man who expressed fear of growing Catholic power. He had never before talked to one of Jehovah’s witnesses and was glad to hear gems of truth. (204, 205)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An Alaskan publisher decided to take his canoe down the Yukon River, witnessing en route. His experiences were numerous Tn his travels he encountered two young Catholic men who recognized and accepted the truth and who are now publishers of the Kingdom message. (76)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Preaching can be done aboard ship too. A Norwegian brother spends up to fifty hours a month witnessing as he travels. After preaching systematically to all on the boat he leaves and takes up work on another. He has been privileged to help many to become associated with the New World society and to join in the preaching work. (221)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A missionary in Japan en route to her territory witnessed to a businessman nnd obtained a subscription. The next day he came to her on the train and obtained a subscription for a friend. The next day he came again— until by the week's end the missionary had obtained six subscriptions. (188) It pays to witness while traveling.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> During August we should be prepared to take advantage of every opportunity to leave the complete combination with householders by arousing their interest with the giving of a three- io eight-minute sermon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> One approach might be as follows : “Good morning. My friend and I are making a friendly call this morning to help honest people get a better understanding of the Bible. Many sincere people have the Bible and read it, but find many things difficult to understand. To understand the Bible, more is required than just reading it. In his sermon on the mount .Tesus showed us how to get an understanding of it. He did not just read the Bible to the people, but brought together the related scriptures on one subject. Note here at Matthew 5:5 Tread] that .Tesus was quoting from Psalm 37: 11 Tread]. Jesus quoted from different parts of the Bible to help people understand it, and the same is necessary for us today.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> “For example: All have lost loved ones in death. Would you be able to go to the Bible and find the answer as to -where the dead are?

<p><span class="font4">“I thought this comparison would be good for you to see and to study over and to ascertain how you are getting along in your field service activity, to compare with the averages of your own country or even the averages of the United States and the Bethel family here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then he pointed out, “This presents a very healthy condition and it has made our hearts glad here in the Bethel home. ... Of course, at different seasons of the year there are interruptions, such as working nights and all day Saturday in order to get certain things out on schedule. But regardless of this it is always good for us to have in mind the preaching of this good news of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After telling about other matters, he brought his letter to a close and said, “What a joy it is to the remnant to see the other sheep gathered and taking on this great burden of responsibility in preaching the good news 1 Together we rejoice in our grand privilege of service and pray that Jehovah God will continue to give prosperity to his people as they biess him every day.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our comment is. we are very thankful to receive this letter from the president of the Society and we are very happy to be members of the Bethel family and to be able to serve our brothers everywhere by working faithfully in the factory-, the office, the home and in the field.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">That Householders May Know</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (2 min.) Chairman opens, discussing<sup>1</sup> importance of giving a good witness at each door so householder will know that one of God’s ministers is calling and your purpose in calling, and that he may be favorably impressed by your witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE 11 (3 min.) Publisher talks to householder along this line without using Bible or prepared three- to eight-minute sermon ‘Calling upon persons in a Bible-education work and have literature that explains God’s Word/ Householder will find it interesting and helpful and may have these three books and booklets for $1.50 contribution.’ Householder smiles condescendingly and. gently closing door, says he is not interested. As publisher is ready to turn toward next apartment door he hears from within apartment he just left: “Who was that, dear?’’ One who answered door: &quot;Someone. I don’t know who he was.’’ “What did he want?” “He had some books explaining the Bible he wanted us to buy.’’ “Did you buy any?&quot; “No, I told him we weren’t interested in any books. . . Say, is dinner ready? I’m hungry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (2 min.) Chairman comments that publisher was not very effective, for householder did not learn real purpose of call What suggestions does congregation have? Undoubtedly someone will recommend use of three-to eight-minute sermon with Bible. Chairman agrees three- to eight-minute sermons are the answer and invites all to observe how much more effective the publisher would have been by doing like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE IV (10 min.) Same publisher and householder as Scene II. After brief introduction publisher proceeds ’The H-bomb, as well as the atom and cobalt bombs, is looked upon by many today as a threat to peace and as a possible means of destruction of our earthly planet. Many people wonder what the Bible has to say on the matter, and that is exactly our purpose in calling. At Isaiah 45: 18 God’s original purpose regarding our earth is stated. [Read scripture ] God purposed from outset that it would be man’s home. [Read Gen. 1 28.] For how long<sup>9</sup> At Eccl. 1: 4 we are assured that it will be forever. Thus on reading about those who plan or would like to destroy and ruin our earth it is good to know Jehovah's purpose to turn the tables at Armageddon’s battle. [Read Revelation 11: 18 ] Thereafter paradise conditions will return to earth, with peace, health, etc., as foretold at Isaiah 35: 1, 2, 7 ’ Turn to chapter 22 in “Let God Be True” and show how chapter gives Scriptural proof of new-world conditions. Then make three-book offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After door closes publisher hears: “What was that?” One witnessed to replies: “It was a minister. My, what a wonderful sermon he gave!” “What did he say<sup>Q</sup>” “He pointed out right from the Bible passages that the earth will not be destroyed by the H-bomb and that some day the earth is to be made into a paradise garden He surely knew what he was talking about.” “Why didn’t I call you? Hm-m-m, I was so interested in what he said about the Bible I didn't think of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE V (2 min.) Chairman concludes with appropriate remarks about effectiveness of prepared Bible sermon presentations, and recommends that all publishers use this or other sermons in house-to-house witnessing, that householders may know the purpose of our call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Introducing the Good News</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (2 min.) Whether or not we gain a listening ear in house-to-house work often depends on our first spoken words. Introductions should be well thought out and prepared just as sermons. While a different introduction and sermon need not be given at every door, varied presentations at the disposal of a publisher equip him to witness effectively to all types of people in a territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (16 min.) Four publishers meet at a brother’s home for an informal gathering. They sit down and start talking about everyday matters. Then one suggests it would be pleasant and helpful to discuss the matter of approaching people at the doors and to get some ideas as to what introductions may be made. Others agree, saying, at times opening words to catch interest seem to be the hardest part of presentation. Brother then gets several different books, gives one to each and suggests a chapter be selected to be used as theme; from it select several key scriptures for a three- to eight-minute sermon, and then develop an interesting introduction leading into the talk and offer. Each prepares quickly and tries his hand at presenting a different introduction and sermon and concludes with current offer. (Make each of four presentations three minutes.) After each presentation, the rest offer suggestions or comments, particularly placing emphasis on the introduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sample introductions and chapters such as the following may be used: “I am calling to help people toward a better and fuller life We all desire to live. Today, with so much destruction in the earth, life seems to be cheap. But not so with God. He counts life sacred. I should like to call your attention to the fact that God is going to preserve the lives of all righteous persons through the coming crisis.&quot; (“This Means Everlasting Life”, chapter XXV) “I am a minister. It may seem strange to have a minister call on you, but the crisis that exists demands that we preach this way today.” (“New Heavens and a New Earth”, chapter XIX) “I am calling on you as a minister, not to bring you a new religion, but to help you to apply religion in your everyday life.” (“What Has Religion Done for Mankind?” chapter XXVII) “The work I am doing is to turn the minds of the people toward positive thinking and a new outlook.” (“Let God Be True”, chapter XXVI)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (2 min.) In conclusion conductor sums up need for effective introductions and the merits of publishers’ taking advantage of occasions, such as the one demonstrated, to assist one another to become better and more effective ministers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> As emphasized at the district assembly, the warning must be sounded! The modern counterpart of Jesus' prophecy is in existence.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Gog of Magog is preparing for his final, all-out assault on the New World society. (Ezek. 38:3, 4; 39: 1, 2) Although outwardly appearing weak to the enemy Jehovah’s New World society Is the only place that offers genuine security and protection. Therefore Jehovah’s servants must not only be alert to Gog’s coming assault, but must sound the warning and invite persons of good will into the domain of the New World society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> September starts the new service year. Plan to share in the warning work every month. All congregations will continue to arrange for the training of those needing assistance in any feature of service. During September all publishers will want to share in offering the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font4"> of either the Greek or Hebrew Scriptures and a book on a contribution of $2.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> This telegram received by the Society well expresses the great happiness and joy Kingdom publishers everywhere are having in using the Bible and giving three- to eight-minute sermons. More and more publishers are doing so with telling effect, as shown in our May report when the offer was the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth&quot;.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Keep on arranging to spend two or more hours each Sunday morning in house-to-house work and then an additional hour or so making back-calls. Tour happiness in doing so will be great!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Interest can be stimulated by reading scriptures used in your three- to eight-minute sermons right from your personal copy of the Greek or Hebrew volume of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font4"> Then bring out a fresh copy of the Bible and present it with a book to the householder. Doing this will enable us to demonstrate to the householder the value of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Be sure to call back on all placements, treating each back-call as a potential sheep. Be prepared to give a ten- to fifteen-minute sermon at each back-call and make your goal the starting of a home Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Fulfilling Training-Program Assignments</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The over-all purpose of the training program is to build up the efficiency in field service so that all publishers are effective and regular house-to-house publishers'. Organization and supervision of the training program are very important, but actual results come from fulfillment of individual training-program assignments. The mature publisher assigned to assist another publisher, or possibly two, must make definite arrangements to work with him regularly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> First the two publishers should discuss a schedule -for field service that will be suitable to both. Barring unforeseen circumstances, both should be able to be at the Sunday morning contact for group witnessing. At least two hours, of house-to-house preaching and an hour or so of back-call activity will get the week off to a good start. Then some time can be devoted to magazine or booklet work before the congregation book study during the week. An evening can be arranged for back-calls ; and on Magazine Day, particularly, house-to-house and store-to-store work can be engaged in. Both should make adjustments so as to work together several times a week, or as often as possible in the various features of the service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> During the time that they work together, periodically and at appropriate places, the mature publisher will suggest points for improvement and can demonstrate as he goes along.

<p><span class="font4"><sup></sup> This training will be carried over into the back-call and home Bible study activity also. As interest is located, the more mature publisher should give assistance in following this up and help the less experienced publisher to turn effective back-calls into home Bible studies. They should work together in preparing three- to eight-minute sermons and preparing for effective back-calls and studies. This provides a wonderful opportunity for publishers to learn how to prepare for field work, and then to see the actual results in the field. Under the training program the assistance of a more mature publisher helps one to learn quicker and to become more effective.</span></p>

The training program is, therefore, progressive and adaptable to the needs of each congregation. Are you as a servant, a congregation book study conductor, a pioneer or a congregation publisher supporting it fully?</span></p>

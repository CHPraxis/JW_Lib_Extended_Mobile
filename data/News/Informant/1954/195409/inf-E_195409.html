<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah's organization is increasing by leaps and bounds. Like an unwalled city it swells and expands. Gog, Satan the Devil, and his wicked forces now see this prosperous condition along with what appears to him to be a weak and indefensible position. With gathering rage he organizes his forces for the attack, being lured irresistibly to his own destruction; for Jehovah will fight for his people.—Ezek. 38: 3, 4; 39 ; 1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Since Jehovah's witnesses have already been warned of the attack, they desire to work zealously from house to house spreading the warning and preaching good news from the Bible. Let all start the new service year right by engaging in house-to-house service offering the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Xew World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font7"> or the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Xew World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures</span><span class="font7"> with one book for a $2 contribution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> During the months of May and June alone, 101,393 people thrilled on seeing “The New World Society in Action.” This inspiring demonstration of Jehovah’s earthly organization In operation has made deep, lasting impressions on publishers and people of good will alike. All want to see it—more than once—according to numerous reports and expressions pouring into the office.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> What reaction has it had on strangers? A sister met a person in house-to-house work and invited her to see the film. She came and was so thrilled that the next day she came to the public meeting, bringing her neighbor and entire family. Another : The Jewish manager of a theater where the film was shown was prompted to tell his Protestant preacher friend : “You ought to come over and see this group in action!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> By now effective three- to eightminute sermons have been developed by most publishers. This month will prove to be an opportune one for using the Bible in our sermons, for scriptures can be read from the Bible being offered. It is suggested, though, that publishers use their personal copies of the Bible during the sermon and then produce a fresh copy for the householder. This will eliminate copies’ getting soiled or dog-eared. Publishers assigned to work together should go over the sermon to be used before starting in the field so each one knows what the other is to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> The purpose of our ministry is to help persons of good will to the place of safety with us in the theocratic land. This cannot be done by merely placing literature. Personal aid must be given through back-calls and home Bible studies. A well-prepared ten-to fifteen-minute back-call sermon will aid greatly In starting home Bi-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> As for brothers, the following remarks from several sum up the sentiments of all: “To see all the work that goes into making magazines and books certainly has made me more alert to wisely use every piece of literature.&quot; &quot;It did more than a thousand words to impress me with the unity within Jehovah's organization and the work that we have to do at this time.” “It was a thrill to relive</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s forward-looking New World society looks to the 1955 service year to be one of great expansion. And it is sure to be, by Jehovah's undeserved loving-kindness, as each one of us does his part in contributing toward the expansion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> We are better equipped now than ever before to effectively minister to men of good will. The training program is progressing well and will accomplish great things as district and circuit servants, congregation servants, pioneers and publishers continue the good work being done through it. House-to-house work will go on expanding this year as more and more publishers become regular house-to-house preachers of the good news. And with more publishers going from house to house giving three-to eight-minute sermons and using the Bible, a greater number of goodwill persons than ever before are going to give ear to the Kingdom message. Then as prepared back-calls are made more home Bible studies will be started, and more home Bible </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font7"> 3, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">col. 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Expand Your Ministry</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> When one is a congregation publisher he need only expand his ministry to become a pioneer. God's Word, the Bible, encourages </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> dedicated servants to expand your ministry that all men may note your progress. What better way, congregation publishers, is there for you to expand your ministry than by becoming a full-time pioneer minister?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> So far this service year 3,8(19 publishers, varying in age from eight to eighty, have expanded their ministry by becoming vacation pioneers. This is the highest number ever to participate in vacation pioneer service. The Society would like to take this opportunity to say it is a pleasure to serve with each one of the vacation pioneers and to note the good work that they are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> While many vacation pioneers are of school age and soon will have to leave the pioneer ranks until next vacation, others, having tasted of this grand service, will want to con-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">■with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Following Through</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On placing a piece of literature Jehovah’s witnesses realize their ministry work is not completed. Good-will persons need help and it is up to the individual publisher to see that such help in new-world living is given by making return calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To emphasize the point, note the letter, on page 72 of the “Yearbook,” that was slipped under the door of a Kingdom Hall. What a blessing some publisher missed by failing to follow through!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Outstanding progress has been made by publishers in French Equatorial Africa, who increased from 112 publishers in 1952 to 416 in 1953. A contributing factor: literature placements were followed up with persistency. (77, 78)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Should return calls be made even though literature is not placed? If circumstances warrant it, yes. A publisher in Syria now conducts a home Bible study where no literature was placed on the first call because the housewife said she “could not subscribe until she received permission from her husband.” Follow-through calls brought results. (196)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Occasionally publishers are privileged to make special calls on goodwill slips sent by the Society’s office or by following through on other correspondence received. Publishers in Barbados know the importance of this and relate a most interesting experience. Their good theocratic recommendation is. “Follow up all interest and leave the results with Jehovah.” (116) Are you doing this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Proper Love</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul asks, at Romans chapter eight, “Who will separate us from the love of the Christ? Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?” (NW) Today with one accord, Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide answer as did Paul in verses 38 and 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Costa Rica, just before Memorial, religious opposition, among other things, resulted in a Kingdom Hall’s being burned down, with complete loss of literature, records, etc. It was a blow meant to cripple Kingdom work and to throw fear into publishers and persons of good will. But it did not work out that way. The brothers had proper love and were richly blessed. (128, 129)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publishers in Greece continue to be ill-treated by the government and encounter great opposition. But as true soldiers of Christ they keep on preaching and are privileged to help interested persons daily. (166)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having proper love, mature publishers in Syria have not been gripped with fear and paralyzed into the state of inactivity by persecution. Though arrested, beaten and mistreated they are determined nothing will separate them from God’s love. (195)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Upon being ■warned by a Catholic missionary that false prophets would come with Bibles in their hands calling themselves Jehovah’s witnesses, a village chief in Togoland had a newly formed gathering of seventeen goodwill persons beaten and dispersed. But the truth cannot be blocked. Now a congregation exists there and scores of people are manifesting interest. (212)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No report in this connection would be complete without mentioning our brothers ■who are preaching behind the Iron Curtain under very trying circumstances. (134-136; 161-162; 176-179; 233235; 240; 269) Let us all continue to remember them in our prayers.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>To Those Who Say the Hebrew Scriptures Are Not Needed</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Oftentimes we speak to people who say the Greek Scriptures are sufficient for study and contend there is no need for the Hebrew Scriptures. When confronted with these expressions one might say :</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> ‘Though the Greek Scriptures, commonly referred </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font7"> as the “New Testament,” serve excellently in revealing many of God’s purposes, yet in themselves they are not complete. All Bible books from Genesis to Revelation are inspired by God and none can rightly be ignored. Jesus, his apostles and his disciples did not reject the Hebrew Scriptures, rather they quoted and referred to them continually. When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness by the Devil (Luke </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">4)</span><span class="font7"> he quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures, such as Deuteronomy 8: 3 and Exodus 20:3, both from the “Old Testament,” to support his position. And in the sermon on the mount (Matt. 5-7) Jesus made twenty-one quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures. It is interesting to note also that at Romans 15 : 7-13 Paul quoted from Deuteronomy 32:43: Isaiah 11:1,10 and Psalm 18 :49 and 117:1. In fact, from Matthew to Revelation a total of 365 direct quotations and about 375 allusions are made to the Hebrew Scriptures. So you can see that the Hebrew Scriptures and the Greek Scriptures supplement each</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Warning of Assault . . . </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d) </span><span class="font7">ble studies. Each publisher should conduct </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">at least</span><span class="font7"> one home Bible study. Does your congregation chart show an average of one Bible study?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Now that the district assemblies are over we are much better equipped to effectively invite and assist others to the only place of security. Among other things, we learned how to increase magazine distribution. As suggested, during September arrange to engage in evening magazine work from service centers before the congregation book study as well as in regular Magazine Day activity, to reach and exceed our goal of two magazines a publisher each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> God has lovingly given us warning. Let us in turn show love for God by taking up the announcement of Gog's destruction and love for neighbor by inviting righteous-hearted ones into the only place of security in this time of the end. other. The two of them make up God’s complete Word, the Bible.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> By resorting to logic, common sense and reason, we could also say: ‘It would be impossible to get a full appreciation and understanding of God’s purposes by relying solely on the Greek Scriptures. Without the Hebrew Scriptures how could one learn about our Creator? how he created the heavens and earth? about man and his downfall? and about the background to God’s glorious arrangement to redeem fallen mankind? The Hebrew Scriptures are filled with Information we need, as Paul tells us at 1 Corinthians 10:11. If we did not have the Hebrew Scriptures we could not understand many things in the Greek Scriptures. For example: In the 24th chapter of Matthew Jesus said that in the last days a disgusting thing spoken of by Daniel the prophet would arise to cause desolation. Without the book of Daniel to refer to we could not understand what Jesus had reference to. So we see both are necessary.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> These and many other striking points can be used to show men of good will the importance of having and studying the Hebrew as well as the Greek Scriptures. (If you encounter people who are not familiar with the terms “Hebrew Scriptures&quot; and “Greek Scriptures,” then the common expressions “Old Testament” and “New Testament&quot; may be used in clarifying the above.)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Where Can Improvement Be Made?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publisher Record cards may be given to study conductors to pass out to publishers associated with their service center the evening this demonstration is put on. All cards should be gathered from publishers before the meeting is dismissed. Encourage all to attend this meeting by making special announcements. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(20 Minutes) </span><span class="font5">Congregation committee briefly review congregation progress during year and make appropriate comments. One then suggests beginning of service year is good time for each publisher to analyze his card to see what he did during last twelve months and to note points where improvement can be made during coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Assistant congregation servant reviews each monthly campaign, September Bible-and-book offer, October “Awake!” subscription, etc., as publishers check cards to note their month-by-month placements. Total books, booklets and subscriptions placed by congregation is given. Servants then make appropriate comments on use of three- to eight-minute sermons to increase placements and to give effective testimonies at door Were eight magazines placed each month or a hundred or more during the year? Servants give suggestions to increase magazine distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bible study servant then begins analysis of back-call work. How many back-calls are being made in comparison with placements? Are notations made so return calls can be made? Is back-call night supported and are calls being made after regular Sunday morning witnessing? Servants stress need for making prepared back-calls using ten-to fifteen-minute sermons. Then Biblestudy activity is analyzed. Does congregation average one Bible study per publisher? Servants make suggestions and encourage more of the capable publishers to start having a part in home Bible-study activity One Bible study per publisher remains the goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Congregation servant takes up discussion of field hours and regularity in service. He gives the number of regular publishers and explains that a regular publisher is one who has preached and reported each of last six months. Does congregation average equal that of the nation? Servants can give suggestions for improvement, such as two hours or more in house-to-house work on Sunday and then an hour or so of back-calls, work from service center before congregation book study, midweek contacts, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Servants conclude discussion by outlining goal of congregation for coming year and that it includes reaching a 10 per cent increase by December and a 20 per cent peak by April. Publishers are encouraged to W’ork closely with service center to which they are assigned, attending all congregation meetings, participating regularly in field work, and to work throughout the year with a purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Remembering Why We Called</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I </span><span class="font5">(2 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">min.) </span><span class="font5">Conductor relates purpose of making back-calls. They are not social visits, but are made to help householder learn the truth. This is important, and minor interruptions should not sidetrack us from this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (7 min.) </span><span class="font5">Householder invites publisher in, turns off radio, ■which just gave latest news, and before publisher can say anything about the truth householder begins discussion of world conditions. Publisher joins in discussion. After a while publisher remarks, “Well, I stopped by to see you this evening to d i cuss God’s kingdom.” After a few sentences a young child comes in and causes a disturbance. Householder then talks about difficulties encountered when training children. Publisher sympathizes and lets householder talk on. Finally, publisher gets back to Bible theme, only to be interrupted by the arrival home of another member of the household. After introductions are made the new arrival mentions the weather and a general discussion of it follows, until publisher realizes it is time for him to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SCENE III (3 min.) Conductor asks audience what could have been done to improve effectiveness. [Note: Be sure the point is made that publisher, not householder, should lead discussion, and that interruptions should be overcome by tactfully and alertly channeling discussion to the Bible.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SCENE IV (8 min.) Same householder and publisher in same setting. In this instance, when householder mentions world conditions, publisher is alert to lead discussion by showing that world conditions fulfill Bible prophecies. This assures us that Kingdom promiseswill also be fulfilled. When young child comes in and householder complains that child training is difficult today, publisher agrees but shows importance of proper training, for delinquency must be overcome if they are to live in new world, where such conditions will not exist. When the other member of the family comes in and introductions are made, publisher takes initiative and tactfully leads discussion by telling the purpose of his call and the importance of all having-more Bible knowledge. Publisher notices it is time to leave but is invited by both members of household to return for further discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE V </span><span class="font5">(3 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">mint) </span><span class="font5">Conductor remarks that publisher took advantage of each situation to keep discussion on the right subject. As a result householder was assisted to learn more of truth and has a desire to hear more.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Is it not apparent, on reflecting just a moment or two and observing how Jehovah has streamlined and made our witnessing more effective, that he has' done so to equip us to speed up the witness work? Time is getting short and there are yet many to be brought into the new-world domain. Jehovah’s organization must be and now is in position to gather and care for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10 Per Cent by December;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 Per Cent by April</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Again this year each congregation will work for a 10 per cent increase in publishers by December 31 and a 20 per cent peak by the end of April. Start now training and helping those with w’hom you conduct a study to have a part regularly In the ministry. Through the congregation book-study service center, make arrangements to assist all associated to share in field work every month.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> When can you see it? Whether for the first time or again? By popular demand the Society has scheduled to show it at all circuit assemblies for the next six months. Come and enjoy this treat as well as all other features of the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Beginning in September, among other outstanding things, the circuit assembly program will feature wholesome counsel on organizing the training program. Step by step you will see how it operates and how experience has shown that this is the most effective means of aiding publishers to grow to greater maturity and to become more effective in preaching the good news. Timely demonstrations and discourses are scheduled as well as field service. Be on hand at the opening of the assembly and enjoy all the sessions right up to the closing talk. Make a special effort to invite good-will persons to attend.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Additional Use of the Film</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>7</sup> As opportunity affords it may be shown as an educational film to school groups, in hospitals and to other interested groups. Whenever possible and advisable an appropriate 20-minute talk should be given after the showing. These will be considered as public meetings. The one reading the script and giving the talk may report time for both when the showing is counted as a public meeting. The Society would appreciate receiving reports on any such showings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>8</sup> A special handbill to advertise the showing of “The New World Society in Action” has been prepared and may be ordered by use of the regular handbill order blank. If advertised with handbills the showings at Kingdom Halls and other places may be reported as public meetings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">of great activity. Do not let one thing, such as planning and attending an assembly in the United States or in Europe, overshadow’ all the other important things that we must accomplish. Preparing for them should not deprive you of privileges of service you have at home. Proper planning w’ill enable you to enjoy both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> Be a well-balanced publisher throughout the year. Attend all congregation meetings and have part in all features of the ministry. Do your part in contributing tow’ard the expansion so you and your congregation will move forward in the greatest work on earth during 1955.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Identification Cards</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> A number of cities now are making laws stating that any person who goes from house to house doing canvassing or other work must be identified. As a result publishers engaged in the house-to-house ministry in various parts of the United States are making request to the Society for identification cards to show to the police when they demand identification or registry with them. In view of this condition the Society has prepared an identification card that may be carried by qualified publishers and shown to police when the need arises.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> These Identification cards will not be given out promiscuously. They are to be issued by the congregation servant to only publishers and pioneers who have symbolized their dedication by water baptism, and who engage regularly in house-to-house work and are capable of doing house-to-house witnessing alone. No exceptions should be made. This does not mean that persons who do not go from house to house cannot be publishers. They can, but as long as they have not symbolized their dedication and have not reached the point of going from house to house alone they are not eligible for this certificate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> The purpose of this card is to provide identification that can be shown to the police establishing the fact that one is an ordained minister of God and a representative of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society authorized to minister from house to house. The cards will not be needed in communities where there is no police interference. However, if all qualified publishers wish to carry</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7">Congregations wishing additional copies of October 8 and 22 issues of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> for use in the campaign are requested to fill out and submit the enclosed Magazine Distributors’ order blanks as early in September as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">these cards the Society has no objection. The advisability of providing cards locally will be left up to the discretion of the congregation servant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Congregation servants may order just the required number of cards. They should be filled out on the typewriter (1st line, name; 2nd line, street address; 3rd line, city and state), signed in ink by the presiding minister (congregation servant) and countersigned by the one holding the card in the presence of the presiding minister at the time it is issued. Notation should then be made on the Publisher's Record card that an identification card was Issued. If a publisher moves from one congregation to another, he should surrender his old card to the congregation servant before leaving and get a new one from the congregation servant of the new congregation where he will be associated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> An expiration date will appear on these cards; so it will be necessary </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font7"> reissue them every two years. The Society will announce in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font7"> when a new supply of cards may be ordered. Congregation servants may now order the number of identification cards needed at the rate of two cards for a penny. The cards are of a convenient size that may be carried in the wallet or purse. They should be kept neat and clean.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> The Society hopes this card will serve its intended purpose and will be of great benefit to the many publishers and congregations where the police are demanding identification.</span></p></li></ul>

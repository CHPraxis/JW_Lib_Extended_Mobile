<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is a God of freedom. To everyone he offers the opportunity to individually choose eternal life. No restricted or fixed destiny is arranged for us. but as free moral agents we are allowed to choose the course we shall take. He has put before us “life and death,” and he instructs, “You must choose life in order that you may keep alive, you and your offspring.” (Deut. 30:19, 20, Xll'l Do we really want life? One’s course of action reflects the choice he makes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">- What has this to do with the 16th annual </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign? Much! </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font4"> is one of the main instruments being used today to set the choice of life or death before the people. How? It shows that the end of this old world is near; it shows that flight to the New World society is essential now; it proclaims the Kingdom as the eternal hope of mankind and, most important, it keeps the name of Jehovah before the world. People everywhere must be shown how very important it is to have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> come to them twenty-four times a year.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> These two sources of inexhaustible theocratic wealth will receive regular consideration at service meetings from the first of January on. At the first and third service meetings of each month </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font4">experiences will be heard. This provides a wonderful opportunity for all theocratic ministers to become acquainted with the preaching activities of their brothers throughout the world. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things” </span><span class="font4">will be studied the second and fourth service meetings. A study of it will enable us individually to make sure this magazine can start them on the road to life!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Will people come to us for this destiny-choosing Information? Ordinarily no. We must go to them. Continuing the training program, mature publishers will take those they are privileged to assist from house to house with them. Carefully they will demonstrate ways of presenting the offer at the door. Talking points will have been selected’before going to a door so the true value of the magazine will be shown to the people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Sunday Activity</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> How many subscriptions will you obtain? To some extent this will depend upon the amount of time you devote to the service. All publishers are encouraged to spend at least two hours each Sunday presenting the offer from house to house and then to make back-calls an hour or more. There are five Sundays in January. Spending a minimum of three hours on just Sundays alone will result in fifteen hours of field service per publisher. True, it means effort on our part, but the added hours will enable us to assist many more to choose life as more subscriptions are obtained.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> As heretofore the feature column “Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses” will group related experiences of Kingdom publishers preaching in the many lands. The two themes appearing in this column may be developed in various ways, such as by discourse, by two or three publishers discussing the experiences, by demonstration, etc. Ten or fifteen minutes will allow for good coverage of a theme.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Special Subscription Slips</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">A one-month supply of experimental special subscription slips for distributors’ copies, a letter outlining the purpose of these special slips and a sample magazine with a slip properly inserted are enclosed with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> to congregations and isolated groups. Under separate cover, an additional five-month supply of slips is being sent. Pioneers working with congregations are to check with the advertising servant for information on inserting the slips in their distributors’ copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Starting January 1, 1954, the special subscription slips are to be inserted in all distributors’ copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4">Advertising servants should be alert during the next six months to see that these slips are properly inserted in all distributors’ copies as soon as an issue of the magazines is received. The Society will keep a close check on the number of special subscription slips people send in during the coming months and determine whether or not these special slips are to be continued. Publishers should not use these slips for subscriptions they obtain. The slips are to be used by individuals who obtain distributors’ copies and who subscribe of their own accord after reading the magazines. Please do not order additional special subscription slips, -for no more are being printed now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Every theocratic family will want the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> for use each day of the year. At the morning breakfast table, in addition to reading and discussing the daily text and comments, it is recommended that the report for one country be read.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> This handy reference book is to be studied from cover to cover. It contains a wealth of knowledge </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col.</span><span class="font4"> 2)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font2"> Wise Choice</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every day of our lives it is necessary to make decisions. Some are of little importance, while others are so great they affect our eternal destiny. As reported in the 1954 “Yearbook” many persons during the last year were assisted to make the wisest of decisions by choosing the destiny of eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Algeria a Jewess who had become rich by telling fortunes was met in the house-to-house work. She recognized the truth, made the wise decision to accept it and changed her occupation. Now she is privileged to assist others to choose life. (156)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “Watchtower” magazine continually helps us to make right decisions. In Finland a woman living in isolated territory subscribed. Not only did it assist her to make the wise decision but also aided her brother and eventually others in the area. (151, 152)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How would you like to help 400 or more persons to study the truth three times a week and assist them to make the wise choice? A manager of a plantation in Guatemala learned the truth and now enjoys this unique privilege. (169)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Honduras the number of pioneers has increased nicely. One of the pioneers not long ago was an evangelist preacher, much opposed. He became a student of “The Watchtower,” learned the truth, and is spending many hours feeding the other sheep as a real shepherd. (173, 174) A Jesuit priest in Peru was shamed by a publisher into buying a Bible. He is now studying the truth. (230, 231)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Greater Affection</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus said: “He that has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me.” (Matt. 10:37, NW) When one comes to a knowledge of the truth and encounters opposition from loved ones, a firm stand must be taken to receive Jehovah’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One young lady in Japan met opposition from her devout Buddhist father, who ordered her from home; she was mistreated in the streets by her so-called “Christian” pastor. She left home and “church” and now is happily obeying Jesus’ instructions to ‘follow me.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(188)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On coming to a knowledge of the truth a Chinese schoolboy (243) and a native Thailander (264) encountered much opposition from family, friends and former religious associates. Both have shown the greater affection by taking an uncompromising stand for the truth and are now in position to be a blessing to many of their countrymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By displaying proper affection for God and taking a firm stand for true worship 'how do you know but that you will save your husband or wife’? asked the apostle Paul. Many husbands and wives have been helped in this regard by believing mates. Note the following: On the day of his baptism a man’s wife stormed into the Kingdom Hall demanding he give up the truth. He remained determined, symbolized his dedication and today his wife, as a result of his good example, is a dedicated publisher. (144) Another is found on page 108. Blessings are sure to result if consideration and tact are used with a marriage mate whose heart is inclined toward righteousness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> For the next four months our attention will be centered on offering to people a year's subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watehtoicer.</span><span class="font4"> Knowing from our own experiences what an invaluable aid this magazine is in the study of the Bible, we are in good position to present the subscription offer to all we meet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> The Watehtoicer</span><span class="font4"> might be introduced to a householder in this manner : “Good morning. I am one of a half million ministers participating in the dissemination of Bible information. I am sure you will agree with me when I say that what mankind needs today is information that offers a sure remedy for our many problems and a real hope for the future. The Bible foretold presentday conditions and that they would take place in the ‘last days,’ the time in which we are living. Shortly, wickedness will be removed and God will usher in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> peaceful rule. This magazine, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watehtoicer,</span><span class="font4"> explains these and many other things from the Bible. It is published on the 1st and 15th of each month and a year’s subscription is only $1. Truly it offers the Bible remedy and sole hope for suffering mankind. These three booklets, given with each subscription, will also be appreciated by</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Individually Choosing . . . </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> The quota for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">campaign is two new subscriptions for congregation publishers and sixteen for pioneers. Last year we obtained 356,324 new subscriptions in the United States. Can we reach 400,000 this year? That is our quota. It can and will be reached if we spend sufficient time offering a year’s subscription to the finest magazine on earth, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watehtoicer,</span><span class="font4"> from house to house. (Both magazines, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> may be offered with six booklets on a contribution of $2. Remit $.90 for each new subscription.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>G</sup> Start the year off right. Show that you have chosen life by helping others to make the same wise choice. Before us is a four-month campaign of presenting the precious magazine, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> We know what its pages hold for us. Eagerly take it to others so they too may choose eternal life. you. I have a subscription blank here and will be glad to write out a subscription for you.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Another approach could be: “Good morning. I am working with a society of ministers. We are calling on persons who are seeking peace of mind in these troublesome times. As we know, by reading the newspaper and listening to the radio, there is much unrest throughout the world. Perhaps you, like thousands of others, are worried by these conditions and wonder if they will always exist. If so, you will be happy to know that God’s Word, the Bible, assures an end to the evil of our day and that a righteous kingdom will bring untold blessings of peace and security. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">is devoted to telling people about that kingdom, and those who read it regularly find they are no longer unduly worried by world conditions. This magazine helps you to keep your mind on God’s glorious purposes and thus to gain real peace of mind in accord with God’s invitation at Isaiah 26: 3, ‘Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee.’ You may obtain a year's subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> which is published on the 1st and 15th of each month, and these three booklets on a contribution of only $1. I know it will help you to have peace of mind, just as it has me.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“Safeguarding the sheep with ‘The Watchtower’ ” shows the need householders have for information contained in “The Watchtower.” “Ancestor </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Worship” illustrates how “Make Sure of</span><span class="font2"> All Things” assignment may be developed.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Safeguard the Sheep with “The Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (3 min.) Conductor opens with talk on our responsibility to people in the territory. He reads Ezekiel 33: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">7-9 and admonishes</span><span class="font2"> each publisher to think about his territory and how it was cared for during the past year. A new &quot;Watchtower” campaign is starting. Are you going to be diligent in offering this most-needed magazine to all in the territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (12 min.) A series of skits, each about 3 minutes long, illustrates how material in “The Watchtower” would be a blessing to people confronted with worldly Quarrels, sorrow, etc. A hidden voice may keep continuity between skits. First, a man and a wife are quarreling. Woman accuses man of having lost interest in home and family. Husband charges wife is trying to run everything. Sharp words are exchanged. Hidden voice says: &quot;Whose territory do these people live in? Oh, Sister </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Negligent's. She was lax</span><span class="font2"> about offering ‘The Watchtower’ in last year’s campaign. How much happier these people could have been if they had been subscribers and read the January 15, 1953, issue. Suppose they had.” He then reads paragraph starting on bottom of page 39 and concluding on page 40. Husband and wife realize how foolish they were and resolve to live at unity before God. Another family lives in Sister Active’s territory. They subscribed for “The Watchtower.” When Sister Active returns to bring their next copy (February 1, 1953) they say they are so busy they just do not have time to read the magazine. She turns to page 75 and reads excerpts under &quot;Making Our Decision Today,” which helps subscriber realize the importance of learning Bible truths and being able to make a wise decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Next a look is taken into a home where a mother is mourning the death of her son. Sister Negligent might have been a source of blessing to her by presenting “The Watchtower,” for in the June 15, 1953, issue, page 381, paragraph 21, she might have read and have been comforted by this: (Read it). The last skit shows a man bringing in the mail, which contains the daily newspaper and “The Watchtower.” On looking over the newspaper he relates it contains only bad news, troubles, woes and whatnot. How long can this continue? Then his eye falls on “The Watchtower,” and he notes the title of the main article of the February 15, 1953. issue “When Will God’s Kingdom Come?” Yes, when? He turns to the article and reads the first 12 lines of paragraph 1, page 113, then paragraphs 3 and 4. “This is different!” he exclaims, and decides to read the entire article, for he wants to know ‘when God’s kingdom will come.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (3 min.) Conductor concludes by contrasting how much Sister Negligent missed in theocratic blessings and how much Sister Active accomplished by calling with “The Watchtower.” He tells how demons are driving world to all kinds of delinquency and emphasizes the stabilizing effect God’s Word has on honest-hearted ones in territory. Do your share by regularly presenting “The Watchtower” from house to house during the next four months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ancestor Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the home of Mrs. Eager are Zealous and the publisher he is privileged to assist in the training program. She is discussing the death of her parents, which has brought a great deal of sorrow and distress into her life. Through her regular offering to the church she derives some comfort in knowing that prayers are being said in behalf of her parents. &quot;It is the right thing to do, isn’t it?” she asks. Zealous replies it is good to know the Creator’s mind on the matter. Thus it is very proper and instructive to turn to the only source of comfort and aid, God’s Word, the Bible. He suggests that Mrs. Eager get her Bible and the three consider what the Bible has to say on this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Using &quot;Make Sure of All Things” as a guide Zealous turns to the section on Ancestor Worship. He relates that if one prays for the dead this necessarily indicates that he believes the dead are conscious in one form or another. Does the Bible show this to be true? Under the heading “Ancestors Not Conscious, Unable to Help” Zealous selects scriptures and has Mrs. Eager read them from her own Bible. Pondering over the scriptures she read, Mrs. Eager concludes that prayers for the dead accomplish nothing, that if one is to do good toward a parent it must be done while parent is alive and able to appreciate it. Publisher joins discussion by commenting that the Bible offers further evidence to prove Mrs. Eager’s conclusion. From “Due Respect for Living- Parents Proper” texts are discussed. The scriptures firmly establish the matter for Mrs. Eager.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">She next inquires what would be the proper course to follow if instructions from parents differed from God’s. Zealous replies, &quot;There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.” (Prov. 14: 12) Thus man is unable to direct his ways without first taking God into consideration. Turning to the section “Obedience to God Before That to Parents,” Zealous points out scriptures that prove the wise course is to show obedience to God and then goes to the section “Worship Due Jehovah” to illustrate the importance of loyalty to God being put first. Mrs. Eager is very happy to have this matter cleared up and accepts Zealous’ suggestion that she study chapter VI of “Let God Be True” before next week, when Zealous and publisher will return.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Study of the Hebrew Scriptures</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Have you ever wished that you could take the Bible and go through it verse by verse and get the full wealth of meaning from its pages? Not many take the time to do this regularly. But if we had a regular schedule to follow each week and if this was made a part of our congregation meetings, would we not be able to fulfill this hope? This is what the theocratic ministry school will make possible for us under the new school arrangement starting this month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Think of it—the thrilling account of creation and the history of Jehovah’s people; the laws and commandments given to them; the blessings bestowed when faithful and the afflictions experienced when disobedient—all this and much more to be considered verse by verse I The study of Volume I of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Neiv World Translation of the, Hebreto Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> will be so interesting and instructive that each member of the New World society will want to be on hand for each school session. Profit from the instruction talks on the most important subjects in the Hebrew Scriptures and listen to the reading of the account by the student speakers. Then participate in the audience discussion of salient points in the portions for the evening's study. Preparation beforehand and participation in the study will provide a wealth of knowledge of Jehovah's Word, which will enrich your faith and your appreciation for the things Jehovah did in the past and yet will do for his people. This, in turn, will equip you to wield the “sword of the spirit” with greater efficiency.</span></p>

They desire to skillfully present the King’s message and point out to persons of good will the value of having </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoieer.</span><span class="font4"> This can best be done by preparing and delivering a three-to eight-minute sermon at every door. On meeting objections, a skilled minister will be ready to give a tactful reply and at all times will show warmth, love, consideration and kindness as Jehovah's name is exalted. Be familar with the magazine’s many features and be proficient in pointing them out to householders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> True ministers are deeply concerned about the eternal welfare of those who show love for Jehovah’s comforting message. Itighteousheart-ed ones, located through intensified house-to-house preaching, will be looked after with a skill befitting God’s representatives. This skill is demonstrated in back-calls made effective by planning, forethought and preparation, always with the goal in mind of starting home Bible studies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">* Let all Kingdom publishers strive to be experts in the field of Kingdom preaching, effective in door-to-door presentation, proficient in making back-calls, and adept at starting Bible studies.

<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark25"></a>CONGREGATION</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>District Servant’s Schedule</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The Society assigns the district servant to visit each circuit in his district approximately every six months. Provision has now been made for him to spend an additional week in each circuit working with the circuit servant at the congregation scheduled to be served prior to the week of the assembly. During this time the district servant will work with the circuit servant as he goes through his routine of serving the congregation and will give him counsel on improving his work and his ministry in the field. There will also be opportunities for local publishers to receive training from the district servant in house-to-house preaching.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> It can readily be seen that this arrangement will permit the district servant to give helpful training and suggestions to the circuit servants (and their wives, if married), which, in turn, will be used in strengthening the congregations served by the circuit servants. While the district servant is with a congregation, he will attend all congregation meetings as well as servant and pioneer meetings. He will support all service arrangements and observe where improvements can be made. He will supplement the counsel of the circuit servant when thought necessary. At the end of the week’s visit, the district servant will give the final half-hour talk to the congregation.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark29"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The circuit servant may wish to schedule a particular congregation to be served while the district servant is with him. He may wish the mature counsel of the &lt;listrict servant in serving the congregation. This is permissible if serving that congregation will not require extensive traveling for both him and the district servant. The circuit servant should make the most appropriate arrangements. The congregation to be served should be notified by the circuit servant ahead of time so it will know of the district servant’s visit and can prepare accordingly. The district servant will write to the circuit servant a month or so in advance relative to the arrangements made, as well as other matters that may need attention, and the circuit servant can acquaint him with the arrangements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> The second week of the district servant’s visit with a circuit will be spent at the circuit assembly city. On Tuesday evening the district servant will give an hour service talk to the congregation and outline the week's activity. Tuesday afternoon, Wednesday and Thursday will be spent training local brothers in house-to-house preaching. The remaining three days will be occupied with assembly matters. The district servant will serve as chairman of the assembly. After two weeks with the circuit servant, the district servant will fill out a report on the circuit servant (including his wife) and send it to the Society along with his circuit assembly report.</span></p></li></ul>

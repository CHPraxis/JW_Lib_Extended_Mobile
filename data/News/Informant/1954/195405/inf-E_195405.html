<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Christ's prophecy that &quot;this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth ... to all tlie nations&quot; indicates an activity of the greatest intensity for his followers. What a huge assignment to be completed in one generation 1 But being accomplished it is, under Jehovah's direction, as his servants publish the Kingdom message io the ends of the earth with ever-increasing intensity. New congregations by the hundreds are springing up yearly as new preachers by the tens of thou । sands join the vast throng of happy. energetic workers. In the forefront of the battle, having a thrilling share in the increase, are the fulltime servants, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">- Pioneering is the grandest work-tiny dedicated servant can do. But. I unfortunately, many are not sharing the joy of pioneering, for it is not easy. But neither has the assignment given to the “faithful and discreet slave” class to preach the Kingdom message to all nations been easy However, Jehovah’s blessing has been upon their determined efforts and their joys have been indescribable. The same has been true of individual pioneers in keeping with the । Scriptural rule that he who “sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you have not been pioneering, plan now to do so. The .work ahead is great. The time left is reduced. The joys to be experienced are beyond measure. Perhaps it will mean adjustments in your life. But mak-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(f'ontinued on page 2, col. 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Spread Good News with Magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Work for a Greater Distribution</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Energetic and wide-awake publishers can spread good, news by regular and consistent use of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W atchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazines. Starting this month let each publisher strive to increase his share in magazine distribution. The Society suggests that each publisher set a personal quota of distributing at least two magazines each week. With each publisher's following this suggestion month by month it will mean the distribution of upward of a hundred magazines a year per publisher. Many regularly engaging in Magazine Day activity are already-doing this and much more, although many are not, for the average per publisher for the world is only about fifty-four magazines a year. What is your average?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> House-to-house and store-to-store work on Magazine Day with the latest issues of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watehtoircr</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Airake!</span><span class="font4"> for ten cents, is an interesting and enjoyable avenue of service for new and mature publisher alike. If you prefer you may- offer only one for five cents. Publishers always have something new and different to talk about with each issue. That means all territory remains new, for none can say, &quot;1 have that magazine.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> There is a pressing need today for placing these foremost journals of good news. Remember, too, they may be placed from house to house before the congregation book study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued on page col. /)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Happy Giving</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Regardless of surrounding circumstances or conditions, Jehovah’s witnesses joyously give of the truth freely. This may well be illustrated by our brothers in Taiwan, who, in spite of persecution, increased from 417 publishers in 1951 to 1,752 in 1953. What method of teaching is used? Oral teaching. Daily, taught ones happily talk to others, so the truth remains fresh and clear to them. Brothers who were privileged to donate material needs forwarded by the Society to Taiwan may feel especially happy as they view the increase there. (189, 190)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On bfeing contacted by a witness a Methodist Sunday-school teacher in New Zealand sought the help of three clergy to defend Methodists’ teachings, to no avail. After four studies in “Let God Be True” he was convinced he had found the truth and started teaching it to his Bible class. His name was soon struck from the church list, but now he and one of his Methodist friends are having their names recorded in Jehovah’s book of life. (205)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When no brotheis are available for servant appointments, sisters are appointed to serve and care for congregation matters. By happily giving out the truth and earing for these additional privileges, they are blessed in theii efforts, as illustrated in Puerto Rico, where a congregation increased from seven to eighteen publishers. (238)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The congregation at Sao Tome in Angola has had much happiness m giving In 1950 the congregation was started with six publishers. Now there are twenty-three publishers, all of them regular. That they appreciate the greater happiness in giving is jfhown by their field service report. Truly it is a wonderful report of integrity and love for Jehovah. (248)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">More Happiness</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The more you give the happier you are, said Jesus. Thus the more hours spent preaching to others, the more joyful experiences one of Jehovah's witnesses has. Since pioneers and missionaries devote more hours to the ministry they enjoy more blessed experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you ever thought while working a particular territory: “Can there possibly be some of the other sheep in this area?” A pioneer in Cameroun working a Catholic town thought that very thing. But that did not stop him, for he knew the Kingdom message must he preached. Today a former Catholic, believed by the local inhabitants to be more devout than the pope, preaches to his neighbors and a congregation flourishes in the town. (210)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Just as a person is admonished not to judge a book by its cover, so Jehovah’s witnesses do not judge the inhabitants of a house or village by its size or appearance. A pioneer in Austria worked a village of 800 persons. And what has resulted thus far? Kight subscriptions, at least 15 persons attending studies he conducts and two publishers reporting 25 hours the first month. Yes, the next door may be the location of one of the other sheep. (95)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Does one ever become too old to pioneer or to share in happy giving as a congregation publisher For a good answer turn to page 87 and read of the 86-year-old pioneer in Argentina, who, in reporting only 145 hours one month, wrote on his report “please see letter why I have not been able to make more hours.” How evident this pioneer desired to share more and more in the happiness of giving!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> This month starts the first house-to-house campaign with our latest Bible study aid “.Veio </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heavens and a New Earth”.</span><span class="font4"> To make your witness and presentation the most effective, have you prepared several three- to eight-minute sermons? These talks at the door create interest and are appreciated by most householders. Publishers using them report additional joys in witnessing and that more placements are made, since the householder's interest is aroused sufficiently to obtain the offer. Here is a suggestion that may be used during May.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> After a brief introduction telling the householder who you are and the purpose of your call, then using as a theme “new heavens and a new earth,” you might say something like this: “There is so much trouble and unhappiness in the world today despite men’s efforts to better conditions. How comforting it is to read God’s promise as found in the Bible to create a new heavens and a new earth wherein righteousness will prevail 1 God’s promise to do this is found many times in the Bible, such as here at Isaiah 65:17 [read it]. Note it says ‘the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.’ Why, you might ask? Well, the answer is evident here in verses 18 through 25 [read portions and make appropriate comments]. Wouldn’t it be grand to live under those peaceful conditions and enjoy endless life in that new world of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Adjustments . . . </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d) </span><span class="font4">ing adjustments is not something new to you. You made a major change in your life by leaving the old world and coming into the New World society. And it made you happy. Why not go still further? Make greater adjustments and enter the full-time regular pioneer service. It will make you still happier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Vacation Pioneering</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Those of school age will be privileged to enjoy this service during their summer vacation, in most cases pioneering at least two months. This year, too, for the first time, many entire families will be privileged to pioneer together. If it is not possible to pioneer for one, two or more months, then be a two-week vacation pioneer. This arrangement was made to make it possible for virtually every publisher to pioneer some time every year.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">God’s making? It is interesting, too, to note that the apostle Peter, who walked with Jesus, echoed God's promise at Second Peter<sup>1</sup> 3 :13 [read |. And here in verse 14 he went on to give this good counsel [read],</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> “To do our utmost in serving God we must be acquainted with his promises and understand his purposes. This book “A&quot;ew </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heavens and a New Earth”,</span><span class="font4"> which you may have on the contribution of fifty cents, along with this booklet, has helped me and many others to understand more fully God’s loving provisions and how near we are to seeing the complete fulfillment of his promise to establish a new heavens and a new earth. You may have this cop\ now so as to gain additional information at your first opportunity.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> When working territory where people have shown much opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses and where they have been told by their religious leaders not to accept Watch Tower publications, nor to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses, a good witness can often be given by using just the Bible and not referring to the offer until completing your three- to eightminute sermon. The literature should be introduced and presented after you have finished your talk; emphasize its help as a Bible study aid to people of all religions interested in knowing more of God’s loving purposes found in the Bible. Letting the Bible speak often gets a hearing ear where prejudice is shown. Always be kind and considerate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> To become a regular or a vacation pioneer will require effort on your part. Consider your position. Plan and make adjustments now. Obtain your application and start as soon as possible. Once you taste of Jehovah's goodness in the full-time service you will view this privilege as the treasure it really is. Embark now and continue in the grandest career anyone could choose—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the pioneer ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare and Use Sermons</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION (3 min.) Speaker </span><span class="font3">conveys necessity for all to prepare and deliver three- to eight-minute sermons. They are easy to prepare and allow for a good Kingdom witness. They show our desire to help people understand the Bible, and the householder is given something to think about, even if no placement is made. Using sermons adds joys to witnessing. Note these points as illustrated in three different four-minute sermons that publisher gives while training another at the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I (5 min.) </span><span class="font3">To householder: “My name is Mr. ---, and I’m calling</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">on yon as a friend who is sincerely</span><span class="font3"> interested in your welfare. I’m here to share with you the kind of information that I’m sure you will be interested in. We are living in a world that leaves much to be desired. It’s a divided world, a world that winks at corruption and unrighteousness. It’s a world filled with sorrow, sickness and death. Definitely it’s a world in which the people are unhappy and are unable to enjoy life the way they would like. Men continue to promise that they will build a new world and eliminate these conditions Many sincere efforts have been made, but it is now apparent that men cannot create a world where there will be no sorrow, sickness or death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“But the Creator of the universe, Jehovah God, can and will create such a new world. Over twenty-six centuries ago, through his prophet Isaiah, he promised he would do this and told of conditions that would then prevail. Hlsa. 11: 4-9) Preferably read fiom Bible, or give substance of this and other scriptures used.] Seven hundred years later, to Christians of his day, the apostle Peter emphasized how such conditions would be brought into existence. [2 Pet. 3: 13] And the apostle John, in the last book of the Bible, elaborated on the wonderful conditions that will exist in it. [Rev. 21: 1-5] Wouldn’t you like to live in that new world? This book ‘New Heavens and a New Earth’, which I have here, will aid you in getting vital information. Right here in chapter 1 you can learn more about the reliable Creator of the new world. You may have this copy on a contribution of fifty cents and with it this most interesting booklet.’’ (This sermon must be four minutes long.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Leaving door, one being assisted, surprised at ease and effectiveness of witness, asks how sermon was developed. It is explained sermon was prepared in advance by selecting a theme and picking a few key scriptures for support. For the one just given he used chapter 1 of the book. Enlarging, he says that to quicken interest he told householder right away who he uas and why he was calling. Then he contrasted man’s inability to fulfill promises with Creator’s assurance of a new world, shown by the scriptures used. By questions and by illustrating the use of the hook, householder was shown means of gaining additional vital information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCENE II (5 min.) At second door the sermon mature publisher developed from chapter 17 on “Sure Evidences of the End’s Approach,’’ as set forth in the following general outline is used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He states that he is working in conjunction with a world-wide society of ministers, calling to tell of good news of God’s kingdom. Jesus taught followers to pray for the establishment of his kingdom. (Matt 6: 9, 10) He said it would not be established then but foretold evidences that would mark the time of his second presence and of the Kingdom’s establishment. (Matt. 24: 3-8) As these things were taking place on earth, the Bible, at Revelation 12: 7-12, tells what took place in heaven. With Satan cast from heaven to earth W’oes -were to increase, and they have With the establishing of the Kingdom in heaven and having the sure evidence from things happening on earth that we are living in the last days, we can appreciate the importance of Matthew 24: 14. To escape destruction and gain everlasting life under the Kingdom we must be acquainted with Jesus’ words concerning our time and follow the course that he directed. Chapter 17 of “New Heavens and a New Earth’’ will be a source of interest to householder in understanding how events today are in fulfillment of Bible prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One being assisted expresses surprise that a different sermon was used. Mature publisher explains it is unnecessary to stick to only one sermon, and suggests trying still another at next door</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE III (5 min.) </span><span class="font3">At this door theme selected from chapter 19 on “End of the Heavens and Earth That Are Now,” outlined as follows, is used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Minister engages ‘in Bible-education work. Seriousness of times prompts call with information necessary for householder to make important and wise decision. Present system is corrupt and wicked, due to its god, Satan. (2 Cor. 4:4) Righteous persons will be glad to see end of such system. God soon to destroy present heavens and earth. (2 Pet. 3: 7) Literal heavens and earth are not destroyed. (Isa. 66:1; Eccl. 1: 4) Satan’s symbolic heavens and earth to be destroyed at Armageddon. Satan and demons now influence rulers to oppose God’s King and kingdom. (Rev. 16: 14-16) Christ is now judging peoples and separating sheep class destined for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">everlasting life and </span><span class="font3">goat class destined for everlasting destruction. (Matt. 25:31-34, 41, 46) Accurate knowledge necessary for wise decision. The book “New Heavens and a New Earth’’ gives further information in chapter 19 on end of present heavens and earth and aids one to get accurate knowledge to make right decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Assisted one exclaims all three are different, yet effective. Experienced gublisher points out how a sermon can e given in four minutes, holding householder’s attention and stimulating interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSION (3 min.) </span><span class="font3">Speaker sums up advantages of each publisher's being able to make up and give three- to eight-minute sermons. They will result in a better witness, more placements, more back-calls and more home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses are proud to advertise the name of the Creator at every opportunity. This may be done the year round by giving generously of the “good news&quot; to persons one meets. Jehovah's witnesses appreciate too how effective advertising can be by their meeting together in assemblies and magnifying Jehovah's name on a larger scale. The more Jehovah’s name and purposes are made known the greater the joy shared by Jehovah’s people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Are you making definite plans to attend a district assembly and to advertise Jehovah's name? By attending and participating in activities planned, your blessings and joys will be many. You may, in fact, share in advertising before reaching the assembly city, as follows:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Car Signs</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Car signs will be available for district assemblies. They are designed so that they will be appropriate regardless of the assembly you attend. The size is 414 inches by 20 inches, and they are again made of fluorescent material. To apply, merely remove the protective paper on the back and place the sign on any clean surface, such as the bumper of the ear. The signs, eash items, are ten cents each. Congregation servants will please order the quantity needed for the congregation. Yon may advertise the assembly and Jehovah’s witnesses by placing signs on your automobile a week or two prior to the assembly. Be sure to use cak signs when going to, during, and when returning from the assembly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Badges</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Everyone attending an assembly will want to advertise by wearing a celluloid badge. It may be worn from the time you leave home until you return. The new card will fit the holder used last year in New York. It is suggested that the name and congregation of each person be printed or typed on the card. It would be well to do this under the supervision of the congregation servant, who is requested to ascertain congregation needs and submit a cash items order. The cards will cost one cent each and the celluloid holders, if needed, iixe cents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_______________</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses have a most important business to care for, the King’s business. They are not loiterers or complainers, for one and all realize that they must follow the sound counsel of Paul found at Romans 12:11, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah’s new-world society is a working organization. It spreads good news of the established kingdom to the ends of the earth. Its individual members, always alert to improve and increase their activity, see June as an excellent month to work hard and busily in the service of their King, searching out the other sheep from door to door and training new ones In the great work of preaching. Eagerly the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth&quot;</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">After Armageddon—God’s New World,</span><span class="font4"> will be presented, for fifty cents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> June lends itself for preaching in rurals and remote sections of congregation territory not too often worked. Concentrate on such territory during the month, and arrange tor public meetings wherever possible. Remember, too, part of our work every month is the zealous distribution of magazines, at least two for each publisher each week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> With favorable weather and vacations at hand, more hours can be spent in Kingdom service. Why not increase your service by becoming a pioneer? If not as a regular pioneer, how about vacation pioneering? Old and young now have an added opportunity under the new vacation pioneer arrangement to show their love and desire to please the Superior Authorities by actively preaching, teaching and comforting the other sheep yet to be gathered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Great happiness and joy come from working for Jehovah without complaining. We shall never cease working happily nor be found loitering at our divinely assigned business </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">of preaching.</span><span class="font4">_______________________</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> You will be happy to learn that more definite arrangements are to be made at the time of the circuit servant’s visit to permit him to train more publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> When he advises the congregation of his visit approximately two months in advance, he will request a list of all congregation book studies and those recommended (up to three) to be served during his visit. Under each study the congregation servant should list the conductor, pioneers and congregation publishers assigned to them, Indicating which ones he feels qualify to instruct others in house-to-house preaching. He should designate the times in the morning and afternoon when the more mature publishers will be available to work with the circuit servant for instruction, particularly those associated with the groups he is scheduled to serve. The congregation servant can ascertain this information by discussing with publishers when they will be, or can arrange to be, free for training. In many instances, by knowing the schedule in advance publishers are able to take time off from their secular work or otherwise adjust personal affairs in order to work with the circuit servant. The congregation servant will keep a copy of the letter sent to the circuit servant for later use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The circuit servant will indicate when and where the congregation servant is to send the letter. He will consider the schedule, possibly making some adjustments, and advise the congregation servant of its approval. This will be done approximately three weeks in advance, at the time he sends the second notice of his visit. An announcement can then be made to the congregation and a schedule posted so all will know the definite arrangements made. The circuit servant will thus have a definite time to work with the more mature brothers while with the scheduled studies.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> The circuit servant will be available for helping all that attend the</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">field service centers as time allows. First, he will work with those scheduled for training, so that they can Instruct others after he leaves. However, all publishers should endeavor to support field service arrangements every day throughout the week of his visit. The circuit servant is anxious to spend time in the field, anywhere from 100 to 115 hours or more a month. Following the schedule drawn up, which will provide him with publishers to work with both morning and afternoon, he will have time, in most instances, to work with the majority, if not all. publishers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Henceforth he will meet with pioneers on Tuesday from 3: 30 to 4: So p.m. If a pioneer cannot meet witli him then, he will arrange to interview that pioneer at some other time. With his second notice to the congregation, the circuit servant will send a Pioneer Report form for each pioneer. These should be completed and given to the congregation servant, who will give them together with the congregation records to the circuit servant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> A meeting will be held with the servants and study conductors from 6:45 to 7:15 p.m. on Tuesday. This will provide an opportunity for all to renew acquaintances, review the previous report and briefly consider what has been done during the last six months by the congregation and to go over the program for the week. The circuit servant should be allotted the last 15 to 20 minutes on the service meeting for giving practical information on the training program and to relate other matters pertaining to field service and the program for the week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> These arrangements will make it possible for the circuit servant to get in contact with publishers and servants earlier in the week,* anil each one will know by the schedule when he is to work with the circuit servant. All can profitably plan for the week's activity and thus get the maximum benefits from the training given by the circuit servant in house-to-house preaching.</span></p></li></ul>

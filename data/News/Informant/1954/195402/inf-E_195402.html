<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Skill is what changes ordinary labor into efficient and productive work. We may be able to perform a work with limited, knowledge, and ability, but the precision of skill is what makes it possible for one to perforin more and better work, with greater ease and less expenditure of energy. A skilled man will make much progress and advancement. “You see a man skilled at his work? He will stand in the presence of kings: he will not stand in the presence of obscure men.”—I’rov. 22: 29, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">AT.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> The preaching of the good news is the most important work on the earth today. It is, therefore, deserving of our best efforts. As we use </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in reaching persons of good will with the liberating truth, let us endeavor to use it with skill. Upon receiving the latest issue become acquainted with the information in it. Remember our desire to give an effective three- to eightminute sermon at the door and when reading the issue select a few scriptures for use as a basis for your sermon. This will enable you to tie in your witness with the issue being presented. Many honesthearted persons will subscribe for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> as you skillfully point out to them the value of having it come into their homes regularly for study with the Bible.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NOW YOU TOO CAN BE A VACATION PIONEER!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you often felt and wished that you could be a pioneer? Well, now jou can, for under the new vacation pioneer arrangement virtually every dedicated publisher will be able to vacation pioneer sometime </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font3"> year. The details for this new arrangement, outlining how one can vacation pioneer for as short a period as a two-week vacation, are set out in a letter to the congregations being sent with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> This letter will be thoroughly discussed at the service meeting. After acquainting yourself with what is required, start planning now to be a vacation pioneer. The Society will be pleased to send you a vacation pioneer application and information letter upon request.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Training for Skilled Work</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Reports from all over the country indicate that the training program has been instituted in most congregations with good results. Desiring to become more skilled ministers, less experienced publishers will gladly respond to the assistance given by servants and more mature publishers in the congregation. In addition to being trained to give good presentations at the doors include back-call and home Bible study activity. Before long many now being assisted will be privileged to aid others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Throughout February offer a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and three booklets for $1. Have you obtained one or more subscriptions? Remember, the minimum quota for the campaign is two subscriptions for each publisher and sixteen for pioneers. With each publisher skillfully presenting </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watehtoicer</span><span class="font3"> from house to house regularly, we should reach and exceed the national quota of 400,000 new subscriptions. Month by month the subscription chart below will keep us abreast of the progress of the campaign.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The foremost means of obtaining subscriptions is house-to-house work. Plan to have a regular share in group witnessing Sunday morning, arranging to spend at least two hours in house-to-house witnessing and an additional hour making back-calls. After making every effort to obtain a subscription, invite people to obtain a single copy for 5c or two of the latest copies for 10c. After reading these, undoubtedlj’ many will wish to subscribe, so call back in a week or two. Be sure distributor copies have the new special subscription slip in them so obtainers of single copies will have the subscription offer before them. Congregations should be sure to have sufficient distributor copies on hand for use during the remainder of the campaign.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> The time before Armageddon grows short and there are still many who are yet to be gathered into Jehovah’s new-world society. “Really, then, as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all.&quot; (Gal. &lt;5:10, .V1F) More than this, let us take a real interest in our work so that we do it with skill and zeal.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Following Through on Subscriptions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> On obtaining a subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> the heart of a Kingdom publisher is made glad. He knows that the subscriber will regularly receive information in the magazines that sets one free and that the subscriber may become part of the New World society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> To aid these potential or prospective other sheep subscriptions should be followed up. First of all, after obtaining a subscription the publisher is encouraged to call back and deliver current issues of the magazine until the subscription starts coming through the mail. Often these follow-through calls develop into good back-calls, and Bible studies are started. Delivering current issues provides an excellent means of stimulating interest, pointing out additional truths and encouraging the subscriber to carefully search the magazine's contents.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">■&quot; When subscriptions are turned in by publishers the accounts servant will see that they are properly written up on the Subscription Record sheet in triplicate. ’The original copy, after being checked by the congregation servant, will be forwarded to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Skilled Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A skilled worker does his work with delight and derives great satisfaction from doing it well. Skill must be developed and does not come without effort. To become skilled ministers Jehovah’s witnesses study the Bible, regularly attend meetings and use their knowledge of God skillfully in assisting others to know Jehovah’s glorious purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sometimes people are misinformed about us and our work. As reported in the 1954 &quot;Yearbook,” such an incident occurred in Italy. (184) By skillfully handling the situation a good witness was given to a police sergeant and the circuit servant was permitted to continue his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Pakistan friends and relatives of a Moslem were surprised to see him engage in Christian work. One of his acquaintances was convinced that it was his duty to kill him for leaving Islam. Skill was used by the former Moslem and now the acquaintance is showing interest. (225)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A skilled minister in Turkey was able to substantiate the Bible’s truthfulness over evolution. A religious clergyman who attended commented he wished his church had even a few such </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">skilled ministers. (167)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Does it take many years to become a skilled house-to-house publisher? Not if one applies himself and seeks to become a skilled minister. A new brother in Indonesia, after just a few studies, started witnessing on his own. He placed 150 bound books in three months. (182, 183)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Missionary Experiences</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To preach ‘this good news of the Kingdom throughout the inhabited earth* the Watchtower Society established the school of Gilead. Qualified pioneers from 52 countries have received missionary training and now serve in many lands. Their experiences are many and interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1950 the Society sent three missionaries to Ethiopia. They enthusiastically began their work with the goal &quot;each one find one.&quot; And many did they find, for there are now 83 publishers in Ethiopia and many more persons of good will are being found and fed. (148, 149)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Missionaries in Indonesia have surmounted various problems to share in theocracy’s increase. (181, 182) At Ma-nado 95 per cent of the people cannot read. Missionaries often have 200 or so persons listening to them explain Bible teachings, the discussions lasting until after midnight. Day and night these, as all missionaries, untiringly serve Kingdom interests. A few additional experiences are found </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font2"> pages 78-81, 97, 102, 139, 140, 164. 193.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The attitude of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all missionaries toward</span><span class="font2"> their God-given assignment to preach in the uttermost parts of the earth was well expressed by the report from Pakistan: “So long as men like this [see experience p. 225] can be contacted in this land of pagan darknesses, just so long are the missionaries willing, yes, eager to remain. When entering a foreign assignment, it is not the filth or the absence of it, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not the poverty, disease or</span><span class="font2"> even persecution that makes an assignment good or bad, but it is the degree of interest shown toward their message that makes the going easy or difficult.&quot;</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>From House to House in Cold Weather</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">i </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions are not always obtained quickly in house-to-house preaching. Sometimes it takes </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a few minutes to point out to a </span><span class="font3">householder the many merits of the magazine before he is inclined to subscribe. In cold weather householders are not anxious to stand at the door and be exposed to the cold when they are dressed for indoor temperatures. If a publisher could enter the home, the householder could listen in comfort as the good news is effectively presented. But how can this be done tactfully and wisely’?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Occasionally a householder will invite you in, but in most eases the householder does not think of doing so. As a minister inquire if you may step in for a minute. Necessarily this must be done with the greatest of care so the householder does not feel he is being intruded upon. The publisher should be warm, friendly and tactful. When properly approached many householders are glad for the suggestion and will invite you in. The following introduction has been used with fine results: “I am Mr. ----, a minister of good</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">news. In our Bible-education work I am calling on you with good news about God's kingdom. May I step in a minute?” By stating your name</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Following- Through . . . </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cont'd) </span><span class="font3">the Society each week. The duplicate copy is filed by the accounts servant and the triplicate copy is given to the Bible study servant so he can pass new subscription information on to congregation book study conductors. In about six weeks from the time of obtaining a subscription, the congregation book study conductor will check to see that back-calls are being made on the subscriber by the publisher who obtained the original subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> subscribers enjoy reading their magazines. They are not just another journal to them, for a goodly number freely express their appreciation for the magazines. Particularly are these comments heard when foliowand mission the householder is put at ease by knowing the purpose of your call.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> If the householder consents, a brief comment on entering, such as, “Now I can't stay but a minute, but it </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">will keep you</span><span class="font3"> from chilling your house,” will assure the individual that you are not going to overstay your welcome. This puts the householder’s mind at ease and he is prepared to listen as you interestingly point out the fine features of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and its value to all Bible-lovers. By tactfully inquiring if one may step in for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> minute, obstacles presented by cold weather can often be overcome to a great extent and an effective testimony given.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Of course, the householder will not always consent to the Kingdom publisher’s entering his home. If no invitation is readily received, do not persist on being invited in. Rather, quickly bridge the situation with a comment, such as, “Well, the purpose of my visit is . . . ,” and go on to give your witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> A note of caution: On being invited into a strange home it is wise to stand just inside, by the door, especially when working alone, for these are evil days.

Ushers, particularly sisters, will be conscious at all times that they are called upon </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font3"> preach to “all kinds of men.” ing through on expired subscription slips sent out by the Society. Why, then, do they not renew </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font3"> their own when the year is up and the subscription is about to expire?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Many persons do not find it convenient to renew their subscription by making out a check, money order, etc. Further, they may overlook the notice to renew when it appears under the cover of the magazine. What has been suggested to help subscribers renew their subscription early? Let us review the arrangement suggested in February, 1952.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Two months before subscriptions are to expire the Bible study servant will see that the information on the Subscription Record sheet is copied off and given to the congregation</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>YOUR SERVICE MEETING </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Examples</span></h3>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Considering the “Yearbook”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (3 min.) Conductor opens with a talk on the “Yearbook.” Being interested in “this good news of the kingdom” spreading to all the inhabited earth, he will emphasize the importance of all reading the entire “Yearbook.” as suggested in the January &quot;Informant,” and the merits of a family’s starting the day by considering the daily text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (12 min.) Family of four gathered at breakfast table. Head of family has “Yearbook” and for refer-ehce “The Watchtower” from which the text for the day is taken. Father invites son to read aloud the scripture. (To illustrate, the text for February 5 will be used here, but when demonstration is put on the text for that particular day should be used.) After text is read (John 15: 8) father asks for question. Mother responds, asking: “How is it that we prove ourselves to be Jehovah's witnesses?” Each member of the family eagerly joins discussion. One points out we must take in knowledge of Jehovah’s Word and then show we understand the principles expressed by practicing righteousness. Another, that we must know Bible facts in order to contradict old-world ideas and tell others what we have learned, for that is what is required to witness for Jehovah. Other thoughts are that we must recognize Jehovah as Sovereign and preach his message, not our own; that all features of field service should be engaged in; by dedication, living up to new-world principles and preaching we prove ourselves to be Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “Yearbook” comment is then read, after which the father turns to page 139 and comments, “Today we shall learn what our brothers in the Dominican Republic did last year.” As he reads the report the rest of the family listens carefully, thoughtfully considering the difficulties our brothers encounter there. On concluding the report, Jehovah’s blessing is asked and family begins to eat breakfast. The father comments how fortunate they are to be free to preach without the restrictions imposed on our brothers in the Dominican Republic. Mother is reminded that there is nothing to keep her from the morning contact for field service, which she plans to support. Children relate they appreciate morning “Yearbook” report and when studying countries in school they think about what they have learned of our brothers in those countries. Father comments that though it means coming together at the table a few minutes earlier to carry out the suggestion given in the January “Informant,” it is apparent all the family profits very much from the morning discussion Certainly there is no better way to start a day than by thinking on God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE HI (3 min.) Conductor sums up demonstration by stressing value of maturity and unity gained by morning discussion of text and daily reading of a report from other countries. This arrangement is recommended for all members of the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Results of Encouragement</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I (6 min.) </span><span class="font2">Publisher talking with four visiting friends has not been very successful in the “Watchtower” campaign and is a little downhearted. They encourage him with helpful counsel. (Each speaks about a minute.) One brings out the optimistic new-world outlook of “Watchtower,” which makes it different from old-world magazines. The second explains how the powerful Word of God, which is “Watchtower’s” foundation, has drawing power if magazines are taken to other sheep. The third tells of magazine's timeliness and benefits of its regular receipt. The fourth describes universality of it with circulation of 1,800,000 in 39 languages. Has publisher been going out regularly? On hearing his no, the friends admonish nothing can be accomplished, if nothing is done. Study conductor invites him to work with group Sunday and makes definite arrangements to stop for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (2 min.) Publisher thinks aloud after friends depart. Maybe it was not so good to make those definite arrangements. Something might come up he wants to do. But, then, his friends were right; he must be active to have Jehovah’s blessing and assist others. Besides, staying home Sunday morning knowing others are in service does bother his conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE </span><span class="font2">III </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(10 </span><span class="font2">min.) Conductor calls and after group contact the two proceed toward first home. Conductor notes publisher’s initial nervousness of starting at first door. He encourages publisher by saying every home in territory consists of humans just like ourselves, most of whom love life. They have right to hear the truth. As Jehovah's witnesses our responsibility is to prepare a simple direct witness and rely upon God’s promise to bless our faithful efforts. Conductor suggests the two work first home together. He introduces self and companion as ministers with important message and brings out in his sermon that people today more than ever would like to be able to fully enjoy life with the modern developments available to make life more enjoyable. However, in spite of modern developments, life seems more uncertain than ever. The reason is a lack of supplying the right information to the mind, getting the proper perspective on how to live. How can it be obtained? “The Watchtower” fills that pressing need for millions today; then conductor goes on with offer. On leaving home publisher says presentation was down to earth and effective. Now that the first door has been contacted, he can proceed alone and does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE IV (2 min.) After a while publisher looks at watch and thinks he will go home. Conductor finishes house and, having spent two hours in house-to-house work, suggests that an hour or so be devoted to back-calls. Publisher has not been going out regularly and does not have any back-calls. Though invited he decides not to go with conductor on his back-calls, but rather, now that he is warmed up, to spend an additional hour or so in house-to-house work, and, after all, the more time he spends in door-to-door work, the more people he talks to and the more he can accomplish.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> In this day of judgment upon all people, and especially upon all dedicated servants of Jehovah God, we have been enlightened through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> to see that antitypical Jerusalem is beginning to be surrounded by the armies of destruction. Now is the time for all who hope for salvation to flee to the mountains, Jehovah’s theocratic organization prepared for the preservation of all persons of good will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> It is heartening to note that circuit and district servants are taking their proper place in leading and encouraging God’s people to bless and praise Jehovah’s name every day in accord with his commands. They are doing this by precept and example, by proper leadership in the field and counsel from the platform. During October these brothers were enabled, by Jehovah’s unmerited favor, to average more than 108 hours of actual field service, and their wives 105 hours. Again in November and December their reports averaged well over 100 hours each.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> This fine example demonstrates that the present arrangement of a definite schedule for the circuit and district servants in serving congregations has very beneficial results for servants in the congregation, pioneers and publishers. Not only does the schedule aid the circuit and district servants to keep their hours up, but also greater assistance can be given to publishers and servants in field training.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The new schedule requires a few adjustments in the personal schedule of each publisher during the circuit servant's visit. But we know each one is glad to make these in order to receive the maximum benefits from his visit. Circuit and district servants are not able to spend much time in a social way with brothers at their homes or at meal times, but the help they are able to give in effectively preaching the good news is what counts. Co-operation on the part of all will ensure keeping to the schedule for the week’s activity and the results will be reflected in greater and more effective house-to-house preaching mornings, afternoons and evenings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> The circuit and district servants have done well during the first few months of the new circuit arrangement. which was instituted following the New World Society Assembly. We feel that the publishers, pioneers and servants will be interested in this evidence of Jehovah’s blessing upon their ministry.</span></p>

While pioneers are privileged to spend 100 hours or more a month in preaching the Kingdom message, congregation publishers on the average spend ten hours or less. Proper service arrangements will help make this time count. With group witnessing through the congregation book studies being used more and more, for pioneers to meet their requirements and congregation publishers to increase and make full use of their limited hours, well-planned group witnessing arrangements are essential.</span></p></li>

Group witnessing may be arranged during the week as well as on Sunday, Magazine Day and evenings.</span></p></li>

If one in a group is required to leave the field early due to unavoidable circumstances, the rest of the group, having their activity well planned, will be able to continue.</span></p></li>

The overseer will wisely obtain sufficient territory and plan ahead of time how it can be efficiently worked with the maximum time being spent in actual preaching by the group. Back-call activity will likewise be carefully arranged.</span></p></li>

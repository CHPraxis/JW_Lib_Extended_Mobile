<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>&quot;WE MADE IT!&quot;</span></h2>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Peak Soars to 169,015!</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark7"></a>20 Per Cent Goal Passed! Our Joy a Heavenly Joy!</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">We have blessed Jehovah daily, and how he has blessed us in return! In March we first reached our 10 per cent increase in publishers, with a new peak of 154,367. Then the very next month the figure shot up nearly 15,000 to surpass the 20 per cent goal and register for April the resounding peak of 169,015! How joyfully we exclaim, “We made it!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not only is the increase a joy to us. It is a joy to Jehovah, to Christ, to the angels in heaven. Did not Jesus say there was rejoicing in heaven when just one lost sheep was found? How greatly multiplied must be the joy when in one month the number found is not one but some 15,000! Is it not thrilling to do a work that brings great rejoicing in heaven? Does it not make our joy a heavenly joy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is only the beginning of joy. Jehovah’s work is nof done. Our share in it is not over. He gives us the seed of truth. We plant it, we water it, we cultivate it. But Jehovah makes it grow, gives the increase. It is time for it. It is a time of harvest, of judgment, and it is truth that separates wheat from chaff, sheep from goats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What truth? Psalm 96 says: ‘Jehovah hath become King!’ That is the truth Jesus said would now be preached earth-wide. The psalmist says that because Jehovah has become King the heavens are glad, the earth rejoices, the sea roars, the field exults and the trees sing. The rejoicing is because Jehovah has come to judge the peoples with truth, the truth of the established Kingdom. This truth judges people, according to their reaction to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And we get to proclaim it, this truth that fixes destinies! A rare privilege of great joy! Let us continue sharing in Jehovah's work with renewed zeal, planting, watering, cultivating, and reaping unbounded joy as Jehovah continues the increase, bringing in the other sheep like clouds of doves, like the abundance of the seas, their voices hailing Jehovah as King in increasing volume until it is like the sound of many waters and heavy thunders, until the earth rings with the daily blessing and praising of Jehovah by all who breathe, unmarred by a single peep from Satan’s breathless, dead system of things! Thanks be to Jehovah for his blessings of increase!</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Training Program Results </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Fine Progress Being Made</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> At the New World society convention last July the new training program designed to assist more publishers to become regular and more effective house-to-house ministers was outlined. The need for this training was readily recognized by all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Since last September district servants, circuit servants, pioneers, publishers and all servants have concentrated on instituting this program and utilizing it to increase regularity in house-to-house preaching. And what has resulted? Much, as you will note with interest from the following.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> The number of house-to-house preachers in September was 71 per cent. And how many are there now? Tlie grand total of house-to-house publishers between April 1 and 18 was 132,906. Yes, 82 per cent! An additional 33,000 or more house-to-house preachers! Also, you will be glad to know that the number of publishers who participate in field service every month has steadily increased and now stands at 64 per cent. With so many more regularly going from house to house, more back-calls will be macle and more Bible studies will be started. This steady progress should soon make it possible to reach our goal of one home Bible study on the average for each publisher and for everyone to be a regular house-to-house preacher of the good news as were Christ Jesus and the apostles.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Good organization is very .necessary if the training program is to work effectively. That all congregations have been conscious of this is shown by tlie steady increase in congregation book studies and in the attendance at these neighborhood studies. More and more publishers are seeing the many advantages of attending and working through these convenient locations, as suggested by the Society. An average of G6 per cent now attends these studies, approximately 11,000 more publishers than last September.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> These encouraging figures and percentages show that definite prog-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 3, col. 3)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Assemble Together</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to regular congregation meetings, circuit, district and national assemblies are joyfully looked forward to and attended by Jehovah’s witnesses, who keep in mind the counsel to be not &quot;forsaking the gathering of ourselves together.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But how can assemblies be held where facilities are lacking? Publishers in British Guiana go into the forest and make their own provisions. People living in the community are amazed to observe the activity and often join in preconvention activities. Interest is created, too, for sometimes assemblies start off with the publishers outnumbered 5 to 1. (106)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Persons of good will also receive rich blessings by attending assemblies. One in the Bahamas decided to attend to see &quot;what it is that Jehovah’s witnesses have ’’ He was impressed with the attitude, love, unity and interest all manifested in one another. From house to house he is now telling others ‘what Jehovah’s witnesses have.’ (98)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Proper conduct at assemblies is pleasing to Jehovah and results in a blessing to others. (70, 200-201, 259)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Heeding Jehovah’s call of ‘not forsaking gathering together,’ no barriers or obstacles can stop God’s servants from coming together. Brothers located in Eastern Germany had to make their way through endless difficulties and most unfavorable conditions to assemble for new-w<sup>T</sup>orld society instruction. But attend they did! (160) Which district assembly will you attend this summer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Uncomplaining Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Complying with the scripture &quot;do missionary work, thoroughly accomplish your ministry,&quot; Jehovah’s witnesses work without complaint regardless of surrounding circumstances or conditions. Note how this is illustrated in &quot;Yearbook&quot; experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Due to physical limitations, some publishers are not able to go from house to house. A sister 'who is 74 years old and has been crippled for 15 years is too busy in Kingdom work to complain or worry about her lot. ‘Thoroughly accomplishing her ministry’ by writing letters, telephoning, talking to bedside callers, etc., has resulted in some learning the truth and joining with her in publishing the good news. (72) Also on page 72 is an example of what can be done in spite of handicaps. A blind brother that regularly preaches from house to house places 400 to 700 magazines each month and spends an average of 105 hours a month in field work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Continually the Bible holds before us the obligation to preach right up to death, if that is Jehovah’s will. A remarkable case of preaching to the very end is found on page 154. A brother, hurt in an accident, witnessed to his nurse the best he could until he died. The nurse was'so impressed she contacted Jehovah’s witnesses and now is a Kingdom publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Eastern Germany Kingdom publishers behind the Iron Curtain continue to work without complaining of persecution measures against them on the part of Communist rulers. (161) Why the persecution? Is it because they are murderers, thieves, robbers? No, but because they loyally uphold Jehovah’s name. But try as they may, never will Communists or any other effort of the enemy stop or slow down Jehovah’s uncomplaining, willing workers.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Using Magazines</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> More and more Jehovah’s name and purpose are being declared throughout the earth. How essential this is to the eternal welfare of men of good will! Of great value In this regard is Magazine Day. The purpose of this day is to cover territory and acquaint as many as possible with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">magazines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> When you engage in this pleasant work, the magazines need only be introduced and offered. It is not necessary to deliver a three- to eightminute sermon, for the territory will receive a regular witness with the current offer later.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Inasmuch as we do not cover the territory every week, it is advisable to present both the latest copy of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> when going from house to house and store to store. The presentation should be simple and brief. For example, after introducing himself the publisher might say, “I have two magazines for you, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">for only a contribution of ten cents.” Yes, a simple presentation like that works well for new and seasoned publishers alike. Many publishers</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Book and Booklet to Be Offered</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup>A true Christian is always busy. A true Christian is likewise happy. Jehovah’s witnesses, being true Christians, are both. As slaves to Jehovah working under his Son, Christ Jesus, they keep busy and happy going about their Father’s business. —Rom. 12 :11, AW.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> June is an excellent month to keep busy going from door to door and training new ones in the great work of preaching. Using three- to eight-minute sermons, each publisher will present the offer, the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth”</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">After Armatieddon—God’s New World, </span><span class="font8">on a contribution of fifty cents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> While continuing to be busy in house-to-house preaching also share in back-call and home Bible study work. Have a ten- to fifteen-minute back-call sermon prepared that will draw attention to the need for learning God's purposes, and show how effectively this can be done through a weekly discussion with one of the Society's publications.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Busily Jehovah’s organization</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font8">using this presentation place between twenty and thirty magazines an hour every Magazine Day.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Business people are usually very nice to contact. It should be remembered, of course, that they are usually busy, so let brevity be your watchword when presenting magazines from store to store. After introducing yourself you might simply say, “My purpose in calling on you today is to acquaint you with these two magazines </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">which I shall be glad to leave witli you on the small contribution of ten cents.” Generally, business people appreciate your coming right to the point of your visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> When unusual interest is found on Magazine Day record it and then call back to be of additional assistance. Many persons contacted in Magazine Day activities are now Kingdom publishers. This avenue of service, too, is a splendid way of training new and young publishers to make an actual presentation. By using magazines you will meet or exceed each week the quota of two magazines per publisher, and aid in keeping Jehovah’s name and purposes before the people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">continues to supply new Issues of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazines, so all publishers can place their quota of at least two magazines every week. Working with magazines an hour before the congregation book study is suggested, as well as regular Magazine Day activities.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> The warm month of June does not mean more time for relaxation. Instead, the pleasantness of summer will make us more mindful of the Creator's blessings, moving us to more energetic activity in his service. Congregations having remote sections of territory not worked dur Ing winter months will delight to arrange car groups, pack a lunch, get an early start and spend long, joyful days In Kingdom service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Having a desire to share in this work to the greatest extent possible, each dedicated publisher will find pioneering a worthy goal. If you cannot enjoy regular pioneer blessings and privileges now, then be a vacation pioneer, one, two or more months, if possible, or for the special two-week period. Keep busy in Kingdom service and you will keep happy going about your Father's business.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Demonstration for week of June 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Student talk to be given by same student week of June 13 in ministry school)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE I (4 min.) </span><span class="font7">School servant talks on value of third student talk. Purpose of the talk is to bring out interpretative points. Much is missed when students merely repeat information covered by the previous two speakers. Perhaps some do not understand how to gather material or know what points should be brought out. Speaker who has the third talk next week has been asked to help demonstrate preparing of talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE 11 (14 min.) </span><span class="font7">Servant asks if student has carefully read lesson, Ex. 4: 10 to 7: 7. Student has read material several times; however, does not know how to find interpretative points. Servant points out that two simple ways are to look up marginal references for explanations from other scriptures and examine scriptural indexes in latest books and December 15 issues of “The Watchtower’’ to find where scriptures are discussed. These publications can be found in theocratic ministry library. Servant has several books and bound volumes of “Watchtower” from library with him. First they discuss scriptures and pick out points of importance, such as Ex. 4: 10-16, Jehovah’s commanding Moses to speak; Ex. 4: 24-26, circumcising of Moses’ son; Ex. 5: 2, Pharaoh’s refusal to recognize Jehovah and subsequent burdens on Israelites; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ex. 6: </span><span class="font7">3, Jehovah’s making known his name to his people; Ex. 7: 3, 4, Pharaoh’s obstinacy of heart. Servant asks if theme has been selected. Student has had difficulty here, too, so after brief discussion of points they decide “Recognizing and Serving Jehovah” would be a good theme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Turning to index in December 15, 1953, issue of “The Watchtower,” servant shows how to find information on Exodus 6<sup>-</sup> 3. Referring to pages 574, 575, they find that Jehovah showed the proper application of his name to his people ana that name was used in its right sense. Today those with right heart condition have been selected as his name people because they recognize and serve Him. On other points they find that Moses’ obedience in preaching despite his speech defect set proper example. Even old age (Moses was 80) should not keep us from service. (W 10-15-52, p. 614) Some are critical of Jehovah for sending his angel to kill the son of Moses, but marginal reference to Gen. 17:14 gives proper understanding. (W 6-1-53, p. 351) Pharaoh pictures Satan and his organization, that refuse to recognize Jehovah and set their hearts obstinately against the message preached by God’s servants ' (W 6-1-53, p. 345) Recognizing Jehovah and serving him mean deliverance from evil old world just as it did for Israelites from Egypt. Consulting some of the books they find additional information on the points in “This Means Everlasting Life”, page 13; “Let God Be True”, pages 21-24, 31; and “What Has Religion Done for Mankind?” pages 116, 117. Student is pleased to find out how to gather material, will use points in talk folio-wing week</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE III (2 min.) </span><span class="font7">Servant sums up points covered. His talk should deal with correct interpretation, use of theocratic library, looking up marginal references, checking scriptural indexes and using theme. He urges all to attend school so as not to miss fine features like third student talk</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Helpful Suggestions</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(5 min.) Servant discourses on fine results of giving three- to eight-minute sermons and using Bible in house-to-house ministry. Many people want to know the reason why things are as they are, but do not seem to know who or what to believe. It is our privilege to aid persons of good will by referring them to the Bible and Bible study aids, which reliably answer their questions. Have all accepted suggestions outlined in the “Informant” to give three- to eight-minute sermon and to use the Bible in house-to-house preaching? Do you have questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(2 min.) Publisher raises hand. Likes idea of giving three- to eight-minute talks and sees merit of doing so. He has prepared some, but has trouble remembering and finds himself forgetting points and scriptures at the door. He would appreciate suggestions from his brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(5 min.) Servant invites audience to make suggestions, such as this practical one. A brother relates that, when he has an assignment for the ministry school or a talk to give on the service meeting, first of all he gathers material and makes notes. But even more is required, he must practice delivering the material. So, he suggests, first of all gather material from “Make Sure of All Things” or other Society publications, make notes, practice giving the talk before going to the door and, if necessary, carry the notes with you from house to house referring to them when necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(1 min.) Another publisher relates that he would like suggestions on using the Bible in house-to-house preaching. He gets so nervous when he cannot find the different books of the Bible. The pages seem to stick together and he just seems clumsy when he tries to use the Bible giving a three- to eightminute sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(5 min.) Servant again invites audience to make suggestions, such as these: Put suitable markers between pages of the Bible you want to use. Some public speakers do this so they can readily turn to the scripture. To find the scripture location on the page easily, some underscore the verse. To remember the next scripture to be used in giving a three- to eight-minute sermon, a pencil notation alongside the verse being used works very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(3 min.) Servant sums up good suggestions made showing how they can assist many more to commence having a joyful part in giving three- to eightminute sermons at the doors of people to whom we are privileged to minister.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>District Assembly Reminders</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> As announced in the Hay 1, 1954, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> seventeen district assemblies will be held throughout the United States during June, July and August. These convenient locations make it possible for virtually all to attend an assembly this year. Please remember to submit your Room Request form to the city where you will attend. Volunteer Service applications may also be sent. Those who expect to attend one of the Canadian assemblies may use the regular Room Request form, mailing it to the rooming address given in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font8"> issue referred to above.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> In addition to attending an assembly every publisher will want to share in field service work. The current offer of the month will be used wherever you attend. Schedule your activity so as to join in field work arranged in accord with the assembly program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> The good conduct and bearing of Jehovah’s witnesses while in assembly have been the subject of much favorable comment. This reflects favorably upon Jehovah, whom we serve. While attending meetings, kindness and consideration should be shown others. Do not mill around the passageways or the grounds during meetings. It Is a good policy to be seated before meetings start, and to be quiet during the entire session, for your welfare and in consideration of others. Occasionally some have left meetings early to avoid the crowd or to be first to the cafeteria. This does not justify the disturbance to others. Be on time for meetings and always remain for the concluding prayer. (See </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer, </span><span class="font8">issue of July 1, 1953.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> As all of Jehovah’s witnesses have these things in mind and apply them at the district assemblies, mutual joys and blessings will be the rich portion of each one. Be sure to attend one of the 1954 district assemblies for all four days.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> To walk in the name of Jehovah is the way of unending life. The worshipers of all other gods are walking in the way that leads to destruction. By keeping our footsteps in the way Jehovah sets for us, we shall gain everlasting life in his new world. Then, in the fullest sense, we shall “walk in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.”—Mie. 4:5, AS.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> During July Jehovah's witnesses will prove their worthiness to continue walking in the name by praising it more and more to all kinds of men. As aids they will use three bound books, on a contribution of $1.50, with a premium of three booklets, or two magazines and a booklet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> Unassigned territory work begins In July. It means contacting people who have had little opportunity to learn of Jehovah’s great name and purposes. In this territory be prepared to give a three- to eight-minute sermon and offer the three oldest books you have in stock, as most of these isolated people have not read the older books and it will be a good opportunity to move these out of your stock. Public meetings should be arranged wherever possible.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> Special pioneers have been working unassigned territory for several months now and many new congregations are being formed. If special</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">Ministers finally classified as conscientious objectors (I-O) and denied the ministerial exemption by draft boards may find helpful a memorandum for attorneys prepared by Hayden C. Covington, counsel for Jehovah's witnesses. A copy of this may be obtained by writing to Brother Covington at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The Society's offices, factory and Bethel home will be closed from July 31 to August 15, inclusive. Orders and correspondence sent in during that period will not be handled until some time after the reopening of the offices. Anticipate needs now and place your orders so they may be handled before the vacation period.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> Though working primarily with bound books, we must also keep in mind our quota of two magazines per publisher each week. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazines do much to show forth the glories of Jehovah. Place them increasingly in the homes of the people, where they can do the most good assisting sheeplike ones to know of Jehovah’s name and purposes.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Training-Program Assignments</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> It is the privilege of more mature publishers to assist those who are less mature and new in the truth to become effective house-to-house preachers. Under the new training program arrangements have been made for this assistance to be given in a systematic way. After ascertaining who qualify to give this mature assistance, they can be given definite assignments to assist less mature publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> But how are these assignments to be made, and by whom? When the circuit servant is with a congregation he will work with the more mature publishers and ascertain who qualify to assist others. Before making assignments it is suggested that he discuss them with the congregation servant and respective congregation book study conductors. They’ might have suggestions in making assignments, so that the best results will be accomplished. The circuit servant will then make definite assignments by’ getting the two persons together and discussing with them what is required. He will explain that the more mature publisher is to take the lead in field service and will be offering suggestions for improvement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>3</sup> This method for giving training will not be a “teacher-student” arrangement so much as it will be a mature publisher going along with a less experienced publisher to offer suggestions for improvement. It is a reciprocal arrangement. While one will be assisting the other, both will profit from the experiences in the field. Both will strive to improve their ministry by giving effective three- to eight-minute sermons, con-</span></p></li></ul>

(1) How God inspired faithful men to write, though they did not always understand meaning; (include preflood documents). (2) Why interpretation and understanding of Scriptures must come from Jehovah. (3) How Scriptures were transmitted, preserved and used by priests, kings, Jesus and disciples. (4) Written Word should be accepted while rejecting man-made tradition.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> The two publishers should adjust their personal schedules so they have definite times to work together in field service. They’ will not necessarily’ be working together at each door all the time they are in the field. Perhaps the first hour each time they work together, depending on the circumstances, will provide sufficient opportunity for improvement suggestions. After this they could work alone, the less mature publisher endeavoring to apply the suggestions given. The assignment will continue in effect until some adjustment is made later by the circuit servant or congregation servant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>5</sup> The congregation servant should properly supervise the training program by’ keeping it well organized following the circuit servant’s visit. He will make adjustments in individual assignments when necessary, following the same procedure as the circuit servant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>6</sup> Much depends on the leadership of congregation book study conductors as to the success of the training program. Each publisher in the group, whether assigned to assist another or to receive assistance, should be given regular encouragement. Point out the importance of close co-operation and support. With each one doing his part, much progress will be manifest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> Assignments should be made with care, and those assigned should take their assignments very seriously. The training program is accomplishing much to increase effectiveness and regularity in the service. Continue to use it to the utmost in working toward the goal of ‘every publisher a regular house-to-house publisher.’</span></p></li></ul>

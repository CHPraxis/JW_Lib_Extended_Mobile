<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s name is worthy to be praised. As Jehovah's servants, daily, by word and deed, we proudly sing the praises of our God. Let the world praise its gods. But as for us, “we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.” —Mie. 4: 5,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Devotion to the name must be proved. July offers opportunities to furnish that proof. Vacations may be spent in pioneer service and long, pleasant days filled with happy hours of praise in regular and unassigned territory. In deeds and spoken words have a full share in activities this month and then do not neglect to report.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> What is the offer for July? Three books with three booklets or with two magazines and one booklet on a contribution of in regular territory, and the alternate offer in unassigned territory of a subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and a book, on a contribution of $1.50. Especially in unassigned territory we shall want to use the older books in stock. Here will be a chance for many to receive the tine information in these older publications and, too, it will help to .reduce your stock of older books. Be sure to present the complete offer at each door.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Prepare Your Sermons</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Whether our service will be in unassigned territory or in our regular territory, plan interesting three-to eight-minute talks to catch and hold the interest of people. Talk to one another about your sermons and presentations as you travel to the territory. Try them out on one another, and offer suggestions for improvement. And, of course, continue the training of less experienced publishers. Take them with you from house to house, on back-calls and Bible studies. Help them to see their privilege of walking in the name of Jehovah as a regular house-to-house publisher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> If special pioneers in unassigned territory would like assistance from nearby congregations that did not receive unassigned territory, arrangements may be worked out between the special pioneers and congregation servants. And, too, let us not forget our quota of two magazines per publisher per week. The vibrant message contained in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> can mean life to those who read and heed it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Keep the name of Jehovah before the people. Be diligent to praise the name at all times whether in unassigned territory or in your regular assignment. It is necessary, if you are to be found walking in Jehovah’s name now and in the days to come.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">From all nations, peoples, kindreds and tongues, over 50,000 persons last year, an average of 139 each day, on learning and coming to appreciate the truth, symbolized their dedication by water baptism. This was done as Jesus commanded, at Matthew 28:19, NW.</span></p>

(Acts 8:2638, NW) On recognizing and appreciating that &quot;this is the truth,&quot; in just a matter of weeks or a few months those who love Jehovah will delight to follow the example of the Lord Jesus by being baptized and then by diligently carrying out their dedication vows. One of these requirements is to share in the preaching work regularly. (90, 112, 113) That the truth is making rapid progress in Korea and that maturity is forthcoming, note that last year 236 of 417 preaching there took the forward step of water immersion. (82)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But to obey Jesus’ command more is required than just to understand what baptism means. Additionally, one must live a life in accord with the principles of Jehovah, to whom each one is dedicated. Gladly, as illustrated on pages 209 and 210, potential members of the New World society, on learning the truth, make whatever adjustments may be necessary before baptism and thereafter live in accord with God’s will as found in the Bible.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Special Subscription Insert Slips to Be Discontinued</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">When your present supply of experimental special subscription insert slips for distributors’ copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> is exhausted, please do not request more. The slips are no longer being printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the first of January through the month of May the Society has kept an accurate check on the number of special subscription slips sent in. Out of the 10,229,500 slips printed and distributed, only 990 persons used the slips to subscribe. That means one subscriber for every 103,329 slips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the experimental subscription slips undoubtedly acquainted many persons with subscription arrangements, once again the point is forcibly brought home to all Kingdom publishers: The only effective way to place literature and preach ‘the good news of the Kingdom' is by personal contact with people at their homes. God’s Word tells us to preach and it is the talking that brings results.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>While Traveling</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses are travelers. Several times each year they make theocratic trips to circuit, district or national assemblies. Additionally, much traveling is done during regular witness work, as well as on vacations, etc. Have literature with you at all times, and keep it near at hand for ready use while traveling.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> When you stop to get gas the attendant will generally notice your bumper sign. Tactfully lead him into conversation by asking how far it is to the assembly city, explaining you must get there by a certain date as you are to attend a Christian assembly of Jehovah's witnesses. Ask him if he heard of the large assembly held at Yankee Stadium last year (most have), and point out to him that it was the largest Christian assembly held in modern times, with people coming from 96 different lands. The gathering amazed the world and proves that the Bible, when understood accurately, is not a divisive book, but one that unifies people of all nations. After a brief discussion, judged by the amount of time he has, you might offer the latest magazine and a booklet for ten cents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Then, when stopping to eat, many times you will have opportunity to talk to the waitress or cashier, especially if they are not</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Unassigned Territory . . </span><span class="font4">.(Coat'd) home I If not a subscription and book, then some books or booklets and magazines. Generally, at least a tract can be left.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> As money may be scarce in some areas, literature can be exchanged for canned goods, fruits, vegetables, eggs, honey, fowl, gasoline, etc. These products can either be used or exchanged for money later on.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Organizing for Work</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> On receiving an assignment, prepare for the work. Organize car groups and arrange for territory coverage. Select public meeting locations (parks, grange and community halls, private homes, etc.) and obtain blank or printed handbills. At service meetings review unassigned territory booklet instructions and discuss the work to be done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> It would be well to work populated centers first and then scattered rurals. Calls should be made on interested persons whose names very busy. If you can engage them in a brief discussion, do so. You might say: &quot;Did you know that a man who lives 70 years spends approximately five years of that time doing nothing but eating? Food certainly is important, isn’t it? . . . I am just returning from a Christian assembly of Jehovah's witnesses. There I learned it takes more than material food to sustain life. Jesus said that we must be conscious of oui‘ spiritual need as well. I know that you are busy now* but I would like to give you this tract </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a New World.</span><span class="font4"> It outlines the promises contained in the Bible for a better world. You will enjoy reading it.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Another opportunity to witness, and probably in more detail, may come while stopping at night. After the manager has shown you to your room, you might approach him in this manner: &quot;After viewing the beautiful and peaceful countryside today it seems hard to realize that there could be so much trouble, sorrow and suffering in the world. Have you ever wondered if permanent peace is attainable by man?” Then discuss with him God’s promise to create a new world of righteousness and offer the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth&quot; </span><span class="font4">on the contribution of fifty cents. Three- to eight-minute sermons on Scriptural themes equip you to be ready for all these opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">have been sent by the Society and studies should be started w’here possible. Answering their questions, taking them in service, organizing study groups, etc., will build them up for future organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> When the assignment is completed, the names and addresses of all especially interested persons should be sent to the Society. It is preferred that these names be put on separate slips of paper, 3 Inches by 5 Inches, along with pertinent Information about each one. With these names you should send a report on the coverage of the territory, informing the Society of interest found and the prospects for development by pioneer aid. Experiences involving such things as the people's reactions to the message, hotv problems in the territory were overcome, outstanding interest found and the effect the work done in the past two years has had will be welcomed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">All Can Preach</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (3 min.) Conductor comments on purpose of training program and how all can be assisted to preach When assigned to work together, do so as often as possible by making adjustments in personal routine. Cooperation is essential for full benefits. Tact and encouragement will often be required on part of more experienced publisher to assist another, as will be noted in following demonstration. Willing calls on Need Assistance, whom he is assigned to aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (12 min.) Willing begins by saying he wanted to stop by and arrange convenient working schedule, as suggested by circuit servant. Practical to get together in order to outline and agree on specific times and days to work together. Need Assistance likes training program, but doubts if he will be able to work with Willing. Does not feel capable of doing house-to-house -work and doubts if he ever could. Does not want to become burden to Willing and feels Willing could do more good by helping someone else. Willing tactfully replies none are capable in own strength. Must rely upon Jehovah’s direction. He makes provisions for his people that must not be shunned. When circuit servant discussed working together, Need Assistance raised no questions. Would be well now for them to follow through, for real happiness results from being obedient to direction and will of Jehovah and visible organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Need Assistance says he does not want to be untheocratic, but feels program good for others more capable but not for him. He is unable to express himself clearly at door, is easily discouraged, fears what people might say to him while preaching, etc. He would like to preach, but just does not feel he can. Willing uses Scriptural example of Moses, who, due to speech difficulties, felt that he was unqualified and unable to lead Israelite nation. Did he say, Impossible, it can’t be done? No! He relied on Jehovah’s direction. Jehovah assigned Aaron to assist Moses as his spokesman. Moses accepted assistance rendered by Aaron. Did not overlook Jehovah’s hand</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Another Makes Adjustments to Pioneer</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">After carefully and prayerfully considering the invitation in the May </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> to pioneer a sister 71 years old made adjustments to take up this joyous service. In the letter of recommendation the congregation servant wrote: ‘This sister is 71 years of age. She is very zealous for the Kingdom work. Though living 13 miles from the Kingdom Hall, she regularly attends meetings. When she considered Jehovah’s call for full-time workers she said: “I will go.” ’ Are you making adjustments in order to pioneer?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Brothers expecting to appear before draft boards or hearing officers of the Department of Justice may write to H. C. Covington, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York, for helpful suggestions on procedure. </span><span class="font2">in matter. (Ex. 4:10-16) After a period of time elapsed Moses was able to represent Jehovah effectively before his people</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Present-day training program should be viewed in similar spirit. It will help Need Assistance in becoming a qualified preacher of good news, if he responds to provision. Need Assistance thanks Willing for Scriptural encouragement. He does want to become a good preacher of the good news and will appreciate patient assistance of Willing. The two then sit down and plan a working schedule permitting them to -work together several times each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (3 min.) Jehovah knows what his people need and when. Now is the time for more and more to become better preachers, to care for the great gathering work. Through the training program all can be assisted to preach and enjoy many New World society blessings.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>New Cost List</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Two new Cost List booklets are being sent to each congregation with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font4"> It is important that the congregation servant and the stock servant carefully study the instructions that appear in the first few pages on how to order.

You will observe that the United States report of 392,554 new subscriptions differs from the figure 370,277 given in the June </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font4"> The 370,277 figure was taken from pioneer and congregation reports, while the 392,554 figure is the actual count of new subscription slips received at the office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another very gratifying thing noted by the Society is the very fine support that publishers are giving to the arrangement to obtain renewals before subscriptions expire. During the campaign 145,447 renewals were received, a far-greater number than ever before. Continue rendering this fine assistance so that subscribers will have uninterrupted magazine service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total number of new subscriptions reported to Brooklyn from September 1, 1953, to May 15, 1954, stands at 788,480. For the last full service year the total for the world was 882,296. Will the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">one-million</span><span class="font4"> mark for new subscriptions for the world be reached by the end of August? It is in the realm or possibility. Remember, any time is a good time to encourage persons of good will to subscribe for the two most enlightening magazines on earth, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> If you did not attend the Boston, the Cincinnati or the Richmond district assembly, then surely you will want to attend one of the other fourteen assemblies to be held in the United States during July and August. A splendid program providing four days of ‘food in due season’ awaits you. There is still time to make plans and to attend. Write to the city of your choice for rooming accommodations, if you have not already done so. If by chance you do not receive your accommodations through the mail, they will be held for you at the assembly city rooming department.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> In addition to attending an assembly, enjoy an additional part of assembly activities by volunteering to help. Much assistance will be needed by each department at all assemblies. You can make the task lighter by offering your assistance. So why not send your Volunteer Service application slip to the assembly city where you will attend, designating on it what you can and would like to do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> While there is much to be done around the assembly, do not lose sight of the importance of field service. Arrangements have been made for field service at each assembly city. Take advantage of all opportunities to engage in house-to-house work as well as to share in street advertising with magazines, placards and handbills. Four days give us a wonderful opportunity to accomplish a great witness in the assembly city.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Bumper signs, lapel cards and holders are now available. If you have not ordered from the Society what you need, please do so at once.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup>A world destruction impends! Warning must be given! Where is the place of safety? Certainly not in any part of this doomed world's systems. Jesus warned to take flight to the mountains for safety. (Luke 21:20,21; Matt. 24:15,16, W) It is in the new-world theocratic system of things where Jehovah keeps his New World society safe. Members of that New World society now want to warn others to flee this doomed world’s system of things and to help them find safety in Jehovah’s new-world system of things.</span></p>

Lovingly aid others to take flight to God's prescribed place of safety by continuing to offer three books with three booklets or with two magazines and one booklet, on a $1.50 contribution. Placements and interest should be noted for return calls, with the view of developing home Bible studies. Help train others when engaged in any feature of service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> With the close of August this summer’s unassigned territory work will terminate. Make every effort to cover your assignment thoroughly. At the end of August be sure to send the Society a report of what was accomplished and the names and addresses of especially interested persons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Magazine distribution should continue to command our attention. Have you been keeping up with the quota of placing at least two magazines each week? Being magazine conscious at all times will enable you to not only meet but also surpass the quota.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> There must be no letup in our preaching activity. Flight to Jehovah’s new-world system of things for safety is imperative.

<p><span class="font4">While July and August witli assemblies, unassigned territory and vacations will lie busy, fast-moving months, do not neglect to report your field service. In past years many, because of being away from their home congregation during this period, have not arranged to turn in their reports. If necessary, send your report slips to the congregation servant by mail just before the end of the month. Do not become an irregular publisher because you have neglected to report.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Public Relations Servant</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> In each circuit the Society has appointed a brother to care for publicity in connection with the circuit activities of Jehovah’s witnesses. He is known as the “Public Relations Servant,” since it is his duty to maintain good relations with the various news channels in publicizing assemblies and other special events in the circuit. When handled discreetly the newspapers, radio and other media for disseminating information can be used to a very good advantage in acquainting the people with the important activities of Jehovah's witnesses.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Primarily the public relations servant will be concerned with assembly publicity. When circuit or district assemblies are announced, he should contact the newspapers within the circuit and keep them posted with pertinent information on the assemblies. He may request the assistance of certain brothers in the congregations in connection with such publicity. Congregations should co-operate. At circuit assemblies he should release important data regarding the assembly, its purpose, what is to be presented on the program, speakers who will participate, etc. He will work closely with and under the supervision of the circuit servant in caring for his duties. A memorandum entitled “Suggestions on Theocratic Public Relations” has been prepared for public relations servants, and this should be consulted frequently in caring for public relations work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> In addition to publicizing assemblies, the public relations servant can assist in directing publicity in</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font4">connection with dedication of Kingdom Halls, special programs, etc. Each congregation is responsible for local publicity and should be alert to use all opportunities to publicize the theocratic activities locally, but the public relations servant can offer suggestions and be of much assistance to the various congregations in his circuit in handling and improving publicity. The servants should feel free to consult him on local publicity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> In handling his duties the public relations servant should use the spirit of a sound mind at all times. Controversial material and discussions should be avoided wherever possible. He should have in mind that tlie information he provides for public consumption will usually be widely distributed. Hence, he should not only make it interesting and alive, but factual. The Society does not recommend paid advertising. If releases are submitted as important news regarding activities of the community and if interviews are planned in order to be interesting and educational to the people in general, most newspapers and radio stations will consent to cover the activities free. Much depends on the contact made by the public relations servant as to the response the editors and program directors make.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Jehovah has commissioned us to preach the good news of the Kingdom in all the world for the purpose of a witness. The other sheep must learn of the New World society and come into it for safety. The public relations servant can add much to the proclamation of the good news by diligently caring for his duties.</span></p></li></ul>

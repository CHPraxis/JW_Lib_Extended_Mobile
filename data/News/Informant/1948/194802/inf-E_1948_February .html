<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow Up Each Placement and Aid Others to Sing Praises</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fate of the world is bound up In a song. Most men will brand this claim foolish, knowing that their destiny is not tied in with any modern-day melody of men. This song, however, is not produced by dying men, but by the eternal sovereign of the universe, the Lifegiver Jehovah God. It is a song of praise in recognition of His supremacy and saving power, and in repudiation of the makeshifts of men as agencies for salvation. Jehovah’s saving power on behalf of the singers is proved in the survival of Jehovah’s witnesses through the terrible persecution of World War II. In appreciation of His great mercy and their sure salvation when haters of the song perish at Armageddon, each servant of the Lord now with gladness adopts the cry of David and exclaims: ‘‘Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lobd, among the [nations], and sing praises unto thy name.”—Ps. 18:49; 57:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not all in this world are in sym-. pathy with its wicked deeds or its! praise to men. To be spared the fate । of this stubborn world, however,. they too must learn the words of j the song and join in the chorus of ■ praisers. Of necessity, then, the saving song of praise, this month and in the days ahead, must be sounded forth with increasing volume into cities and towns, homes and business places, and on the streets, in all nations, until heard and acted upon by the great multitude and it is no longer necessary to sing it under stress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The “Song of Piiaise” Testimony Period marks the movement of the 1948 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign into its second month. At the doors a year’s subscription is offered at the usual rate of $1.00. With the subscription go eight praise-bringing booklets, free. Securing a subscription or placing literature does not in itself accomplish the minister’s purpose to teach others the words of Jehovah’s perfect Songbook, the Bible, and train them to sing his praises. More is required. We are obligated to return to the homes of subscribers or one receiving literature and by repeated singing cause the song of praise to sink down into the heart of the listener, there to take root, alter his life-course, and induce his breaking forth into joyous praise. Study </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> Develop an extempore discussion of its contents, at least the opening paragraphs, and talk it up enthusiastically on your return calls. Make known that now, since the magazine is being received, its value will be realized only if its pages are perused. Your interest as a minister lies in showing the subscriber how to get the greatest pos</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">sible benefit from it and in the least possible time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Strike up a home study by raising the question on the first paragraph. Discuss it, look up cited Scripture texts, and have the paragraph read. Take the initiative, in a kind, tactful, considerate manner, display keen interest in the spiritual well-being of the householder, and numerous right-minded subscribers will respond to home studies and learn the song, to their joy and salvation. As the weekly home </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study progresses, questions will invariably arise on fundamental Bible doctrines. Be alert to direct attention to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font1"> with its simple and comprehensive explanation. It will usually be desirable in a month or so to revert to a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font1">study, to clear up these questions and lay the groundwork for a better grasping of the contents of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> Changing over to a book study is not a matter of ignoring </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> thereafter, but rather keeping both publications to the fore, thus training the householder for future singing of praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At many homes the combination of booklets alone will be placed. Acceptance of a smaller offer is no proof of lesser degree of interest in the song. Every obtainer deserves equal consideration, and as you call back to encourage study of the booklets the way will often open for obtaining a subscription or placing a bound book. Build up the 1948 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign to a grand climax, by assuming the responsibility of calling back, time and again, on subscribers and all others who were favorably affected by your initial song of praise at the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep “on the Job” in All Seasons</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Low temperatures and snow-covered streets do not present insurmountable obstacles. Dress warmly during February and use discretion, so as to keep your health and be fit for continued praise. If you become too cold, try to locate a warm spot for a while, then go out again. Some will be glad to invite you in. The song of praise will be heard on the streets with magazines as well as in public meeting activity, during this winter month. Carry subscription slips with you on the streets, in addition to the booklet combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In winter and summer, in all sorts of weather, Jehovah’s witnesses distinguish themselves by being “on the job”. Diligence of God’s singers the year round brings favorable comments from many of the public, who are impressed with their untiring zeal and determination. During February, keep “on the job”, singing despite cold weather or other obstacles. Sing the glorious “Song of Praise” to Jehovah in all features of the ministry, for thereby comes salvation both for you and for those who hear you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">We have come to the end of the first year of circuit assembly activity. All circuits have been served twice, and the over-all results are gratifying. Great benefit can be derived from a study of the comparisons which are herewith presented. These figures do not by any means indicate perfection of accomplishment, for they bring to our attention some very outstanding weaknesses that we should by all means endeavor to remedy. Yet the reports show good progress and a definite trend toward greater results in the future.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Healthy company activity is reflected in increased peak number of publishers, average number of publishers, number associated, and the number of public meetings. Retrogression is shown in the circuit assembly attendance and immersions. The decrease can be accounted for to some degree by the fact that we had two national conventions during the last six months of 1947. Undoubtedly this decline is but temporary. However, the things from which we can take real joy are that, despite the time, labor and expense involved in traveling to the national conventions, an almost 3-percent increase was effected in the number of associated, the peak number of publishers was 6 percent higher, and there was a 7-percent increase in the average number of publishers participating in the field work. This increase in number of publishers indicates that a great many of those who in the past were merely associated have now become regular publishers. The increase in the peak and the average number of publishers being almost the same shows that new ones starting out in field service are continuing therein regularly each month. The public meeting activity shows a substantial and gratifying increase of 23 percent. It is reasonable to conclude that, in addition to the expanded public witness given from the platform, about 23-25 percent more territory was covered in house-to-house witnessing. These are all sources of satisfaction and joy. There has been healthy growth and progress in the most vital features of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Forsake Not Assembling</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Figures gathered at the circuit assemblies also reveal that attendance at the company meetings is probably our outstanding weakness. Of the total number of publishers, 77 percent are attending the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study, 62 percent attend the service meeting, and 59 percent attend the Theocratic ministry school. This merits the serious attention of all of us, for, spiritually, we are what we eat. It is only with minds transformed by repeated and continuous study that we can prove or understand what God’s will Is toward us. (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 5:10, .17) One who does not study as the Lord directs cannot be a good witness. His mind is not renewed and alerted to Kingdom requirements and the revealed purposes of the Lord as much as it could and should be. Those regularly absent from service meetings are not fully aware of the many details of the campaigns taken up and discussed at the service meeting, the many problems to be coped with, and the plans made to meet them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Likewise, those who do not keep up with the Theocratic ministry school and its study of the Bible books, participate in speaking assignments and the oral and written reviews, are to that extent limited in their Kingdom service. It is true that all of this requires effort, but the spiritual compensation received from the effort put forth, and the blessing it enables us to bring to others, repays us a thousandfold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It may be that there are some who because of old age, physical Infirmities or other causes may not be able to keep up with all the studies outlined, and undoubtedly the Lord will accept their best efforts. But such would not apply to those who are able to attend and do not. It is dangerous to spurn the Lord’s table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These things have been called to your attention that you may be conscious of the true conditions. The commendable progress in number of publishers in the field is not something with which to be content, for we can prepare for even greater increases in the future by taking full advantage of God’s provisions for our instruction. Attend the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study, service meeting and Theocratic school regularly; attend the assembly in your circuit every six months and your district assembly during the coming year. Forsake not the assembling of yourselves. The spiritual nourishment provided at all of these God-provided meetings will equip alert servants to overcome their weaknesses and accomplish further heartening increases in the years to come.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Will March See a Peak of Publishers?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The Bible is Jehovah’s Word. His purpose in giving us the inspired Scriptures the apostle Paul forcibly emphasizes in the text for March: “All scripture is inspired by God and profitable ... to make the man of God proficient and equip him for good work of every kind.”—2 Tim. 3:16,17, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The better we understand the Bible, the stronger our conviction will be that it is indeed the inspired Word of Jehovah God and the better equipped we shall be for good work of every kind. This requires study, not only of his Word, the Bible, but also of all the helps be has provided for our understanding it. Foremost among such helps is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Good work” is that leading to the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and, for creatures on earth today, consists of maintaining integrity by bearing witness to the truth. During March, all properly equipped men of God will engage in good work by going from house to house presenting </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font1"> the subscription for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> at the subscription rate of $1.00 (or, if desired, a two-subscription offer including both magazines, with the premium of eight booklets with each subscription). If unable to obtain the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-tower</span><span class="font1"> subscription, introduce the alternate offers, a subscription for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> a bound book or a booklet combination, or, lastly, the new booklet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The Joy of All the People”, </span><span class="font1">a copy of which should be left at every home where they will read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Good work” also includes calling back on all those who have manifested interest and who seek to increase their appreciation and understanding of the inspired Scriptures. Call back with a definite purpose and be properly equipped to carry out that purpose. Remember, placing the literature is only the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">first </span><span class="font1">step. Advertising and attending the public meetings are also included in “good work”, and should not be overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Week-End Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Outstanding in “good work” for March will be the assembling for the Memorial celebration on Thursday evening March 25. This event always gives stimulus to the zeal of Jehovah’s servants, repeatedly resulting in a peak of publishers. With proper advance preparation another peak is possible this time. To aid</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>District Assembly at Atlanta</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The first of the 1948 district assemblies in the United States will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, March 12-14, at the Municipal Auditorium, 30 Courtland Street. Room Request Forms and other details have already been sent to all companies embraced within District No. 2, in which this assembly is being held. All publishers should see to it that their Room Request Forms are forwarded to Watchtower Convention, 203 Spring Street N.W., Atlanta 3, Georgia, not later than February 5. Brother Knorr and other representatives of the Society’s headquarters expect to be present at this assembly and serve on the program. The Society also hopes to operate a cafeteria for the convenience of the brethren. All publishers should begin planning now to attend this assembly, and encourage all their good-will interest to come to the convention with them. companies in planning a full weekend of Theocratic activity, the following suggestions are given:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Group witnessing should be arranged for daily from Thursday through Sunday, making a special effort to take newly interested along in field service. All will attend the Memorial celebration Thursday evening, inviting and bringing their good-will interest along. Friday evening should see a well-prepared and interesting service meeting as well as school in Theocratic ministry. Companies usually holding service meetings Thursday evening will change to Friday during this special week-end activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Saturday afternoon and evening should see all-out advertising of the public meeting. Sunday forenoon all should endeavor to engage in door-to-door work presenting the current offer and advertising the public talk, which should be held on Sunday, either afternoon or evening. This talk should be followed shortly by the study in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> Many companies will be able to begin the new series, providing additional stimulus to the week-end activity. With all publishers taking full advantage of the many opportunities presented by this full program of Theocratic activity to encourage new and weak publishers to similar “good work”, a peak of publishers can be attained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let each one show his appreciation of God’s gift of the inspired Scriptures by equipping himself for and engaging in “good work” of every kind throughout the month of March.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Companies Furnishing Literature to Pioneers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The instructions set forth in the December, 1947, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> should be followed when pioneers obtain literature from companies. Thus it will be unnecessary for companies to send the Society a letter when making such transactions. The instructions given with the inauguration of the new Literature Request Form take the place of previous instructions Issued In the letter of October 23, 1947, sent to companies and pioneers.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Foreign-speaking People to Benefit</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The flow of truth reaching hearing ears from the public platform has continuously swelled until today there is scarcely a community that has not had the opportunity to benefit. Speakers have prepared diligently, companies have planned carefully, publishers have co-operated closely, and much assistance has been given to the weak and inactive to share in the public meeting work. All have worked in harmony with and have been directed by the spirit of Jehovah. With this continuing, why should not this feature of our work be growing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Because of this constant effort on the part of our brethren, worldwide, the encouraging report on public meetings in the 1948 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font1">was made possible. Well over 100,000 meetings held in all nations and presented in all languages, with a total attendance reaching into millions! A world attendance figure of 250,582 on one Sunday alone! Yet before us lies the prospect of even greater increases as the Theocratic organization expands and all companies become more aware that the public meetings are now an integral part of our Theocratic activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Talks Give Impetus</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The public meeting program will be given added Impetus during 1948 by the provision of a new series of talks. Their titles are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;A Signal for All Nations” “Is Christendom Christian?” “Which Is the True Church?” “God’s Purpose</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now Reaching a Climax” “Learning to Live Forever” “Who Are God’s Ministers?” “A Ransom for All People” “The ‘Last Days’,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Then a Peaceful World”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This new series of talks will begin Sunday, March 28, 1948, or as soon thereafter as possible. Some may have to wait a week or so, due to insufficient speakers, and companies being visited by the servant to the brethren should use his talk “Paradise Earth—Man’s Permanent Home” for March 28. Do not schedule a series of the old talks to begin after this date, but complete the old series if it is in progress at that time. Whichever talk is given on March 28 will contribute its share to the effectiveness of the Memorial week-end activity. Advertise and support it enthusiastically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Three sets of the new outlines are being sent to each company with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font1"> Two sets are to be distributed to the speakers, and the third set kept in the Theocratic ministry school library. It would be well for the company committee and the Theocratic ministry school servant to immediately review the instructions in the March, 1947, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> relative to public meetings, and consider this material during a service meeting. Lay all plans carefully and order your handbills early. Avoid rush orders as much as possible. If you lack speakers, cooperate with near-by companies that can assist you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Foreign-Language Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Foreign-language meetings, which have already had an enthusiastic response, will be continued with the new talks. Selection and qualifications of speakers and all arrangements for these meetings will be the same as with the English meetings, and made under the direction of the servants of the company. No meetings should be arranged for independent of the company organization. Foreign-speaking brethren who have shown a keen desire to improve their ministry by enrolling and participating in the Theocratic Ministry school will now have the privilege of delivering the message in their own language if the committee and the school servant deem them qualified. Experience gained through the ministry course will undoubtedly be a great aid to these brethren in preparing the one-hour talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When ordering handbills for foreign-language meetings, keep in mind that all copy for the front side of the handbill must be given in the language in which you wish it to appear. If portions are omitted or left untranslated, the order will be returned for correction. It is as important for the company servant to check these orders as any other correspondence with the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The stage for public meetings has again been set. Speakers, continue to prepare diligently, keeping your talks fresh, alive and up-to-date as the year advances. All companies, prepare to participate in the public meeting feature of the service even though you may not have done so in the past. All publishers, give this feature of your ministry the full support that is its due. With this done world-wide, what increases may we expect in the public meetings during 1948? Let’s get off to a good start!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Personal Pioneer Letter</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Aims Toward 10 Percent Goal</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">A most favorable opportunity now opens up for the servants of Jehovah to become pioneers. The new provision of lowered requirements provides the opportunity, and we confidently anticipate a ready response from all who can avail themselves of this helpful arrangement. That each servant of God may be assisted to give personal consideration to this important matter, an individual copy of a letter on the pioneer service is being sent with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font1">Besides being studied personally, this letter is to be read as part of the next service meeting and fully discussed during a subsequent service meeting in that month, as well as be read at the first </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">study after its receipt</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Present Response Gratifying;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Many Enroll</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Expressions of joy and appreciation pour into the office daily because brethren previously unable to pioneer can now do so. “Please send me a pioneer application,” writes one sister; “this is the happiest day of my life.” Two others who had asked to be dropped from the list wrote: “Please cancel our removal; we can meet the requirements now.” Still another says, “The new arrangement Is a loving and merciful provision of our heavenly Father and will bring about a great increase in the ranks of full-time ministers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Heartfelt gratitude moves such to active service. As you read your copy of the pioneer letter, may love for Jehovah and his righteous cause prompt you to zealous action. Brothers, sisters, the young, the old, all who possibly can, grasp this opportunity. Remember, the goal is 10 percent of all publishers to be In the pioneer service. May you be numbered among the growing throng of joyful, full-time praisers.</span></p>

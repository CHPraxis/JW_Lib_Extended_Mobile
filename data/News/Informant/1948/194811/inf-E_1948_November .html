<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Booklet Presented</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Neither peace nor unity find their beginning in the praise rendered by this world. Praise is there, to be sure, but praise of men and their varied but imperfect accomplishments ; in fact, praise of almost everything except the Creator, who is worthy to be praised. No wonder they have no peace! However, there is one organization that praises God and seeks to follow the instructions of the apostle, “. . . keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.” (Eph. 4:3) Peace is granted as a reward for this proper praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Enjoying the blessings of peace, these servants of God are free to spread peace to others through united praise. During November they will do this by directing the attention of the people to the timely message in the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font1"> and either the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People,</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of 35c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Book Studies Essential</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Experience has already proved the practicability of studies, for most new publishers have learned the truth through such studies. Where many studies are conducted the increase in publishers is usually rapid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The conducting of studies with teachable persons is the individual responsibility of each servant before his master. None should sit back and wait for another to start a study for him, yet those who are more proficient realize that united praise can be effectively demonstrated by helping others to get started in this important field of service. It is another means of proving our integrity and caring for the life interests of our congregation, the meek who live in our territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During November, when both a bound book and booklets are being placed, there will be many opportunities to start studies. It is not necessary to wait until a book is placed. Frequently studies can be started in the booklets. They furnish a theme for the publisher and hence serve as an aid to a successful back-call. By being well acquainted with the material, a very interesting and lively discussion can often be carried on. Keep the discussion informal, ask a question, turn to the booklet for the answer, and soon a booklet study may be in operation. A few extra copies of the publication will prove helpful if others are present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, since our primary purpose is to start studies in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font1"> we must be alert for opportunities to switch from the booklet to a book study. Perhaps a point under discussion can be backed up with material from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Cod Be True”,</span><span class="font1"> thus introducing it and opening the way for continued study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Share Peace Through United Praise</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As soon as a study is started and truths concerning God and his purpose begin to fill the mind of the student, peace replaces former fears, but it is only through uniting with Jehovah’s ministers in active praise that complete enjoyment of peace can be attained. The study is the proper place to start training these new prospective ministers. Let them know of your joys in service; keep them informed of the service program, the public meetings and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> studies; tell of recent assemblies which so clearly illustrate the peace that exists within the organization of Jehovah. The desire to share this peace will motivate many to united praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Most, of course, will need a helping hand; an invitation to other studies, special calls to take them to meetings and Introductions to other witnesses. While their forward steps into service must stem from a desire to serve, we can make those steps easier by continued assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the study attendant will accompany you to another study, help him to participate and later perhaps to assist you in conducting it. They need not be old in the truth to conduct a study. Having attended the one conducted by you they are now equipped to conduct one themselves, for even after only a few lessons they know more about the Bible than most churchgoers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the student progresses it may be possible to turn a study over to him, but it would be well for the original conductor to continue to attend from time to time to see that it is being properly cared for, or to further instruct the new conductor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With the knowledge, then, that all must share in Jehovah’s praise in order to share in his peace, let us give diligence to the starting of book studies with all who show themselves to be teachable, regardless of what, if any, publication they may have obtained. Then, let us make the study a center of Theocratic education where prospective publishers are instructed to assist others to praise Jehovah unitedly until all who live are bound together ‘‘in the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace”,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“Godliness is an everyday way of life. It takes hold on all of life’s relationships, whether one is a father, mother or child, an old person or young, a slave or freeman, an employer or a laborer, an appointed servant ... or just an average member. It tries to copy Jesus Christ . . . It strives to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">do all things as if they were being done directly to God.”—The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> September 1, 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Godliness means Theocratic living, 24 hours daily, for the Christian minister. It embraces proper conduct in the field, at company meetings, circuit and district assemblies. It means exemplary behavior in one’s own home, at his place of employment, or wherever his steps may carry him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In his everyday way of life, the minister will strive to be kind, meek, helpful, clean in habit, dress and speech, applying godly principles. Thus, whether out in the field of ministry or away therefrom, he will be serving God “day and night”, and by his “good works” draw “sheep” to the King and the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Company meetings are vital for our continued life of godliness, with its gains. Attending meetings is important, but attending them </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">on time </span><span class="font1">is also important. Avoid getting into the easily-formed bad habit of coming late to meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Gaining full benefit from meetings will necessitate attentiveness and concentration from start to finish. Distracting practices, such as whispering, candy-eating, etc., should be avoided during meetings. Parental oversight of children is a godly requirement. Needless noise-making and running about should be eliminated. By sitting with children of tender years, parents train them to be attentive and gain benefits from company studies.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Reporting Baptisms</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Baptism ceremonies at circuit and district assemblies have proved adequate for the majority of those being baptized in recent years, and those desiring to be immersed are urged to take advantage of this arrangement as far as possible. Occasionally, however, circumstances arise that make it necessary for baptisms to be administered by the local company or by pioneers or other isolated ministers. In such instances it is requested that a report be sent to the Society by recording at the bottom of the monthly report card the number baptized. This also applies to companies and pioneers in other countries reporting to this office. Any who have performed baptisms during September or October should send this information with their November reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A record of the date of baptism should be kept by the company on the publisher’s record card, and It is suggested that the individual baptized also keep a personal record. equipment, and wholesome speech, should characterize the godly servant Staying “overtime” at homes of good-will, or even of brethren to,o polite to ask one to leave, is not a wise practice. If you have occasion to speak to your brethren while they are in the street work, do so with the dignity and respect becoming the lofty work in which they are engaged. Do not act facetiously or manifest indifference. Display seriousness, yet be pleasant and courteous to all who pass by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every day, in every part of Christian endeavor, make your life one of glory to Jehovah and profit to your brethren and those of goodwill. Godliness in conduct will prove a healthful way of life, with rich rewards.</span></p>

Your company’s quota appears on the company chart. Whether your group is large or small, let nothing hinder you from attaining it. Begin this month, yes, today, to see that next year the United States is among the countries that reach their Increase of 10 percent. Can we have 80,239 publishers each month in 1949? Companies and pioneers, let us raise our voices regularly in praise of Jehovah, and the answer to that question can be an emphatic “Yes” I For our first report of the new service year we fell behind our quota by 4,826 publishers. By the Lord’s grace, we will make that up by all of us doing our ministerial work in October and November. “I will . . . yet praise thee more and more.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Setting the Mark” Testimony Period </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Work for Peak of Publishers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>“Set the Mark” with Book Studies</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">With tiie complete annihilation of Satan’s abominable world-rule dangerously near, Jehovah’s ministers hasten to obey God’s command: “Go through the midst of the city . . . and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">set a mark</span><span class="font1"> upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done.” (Ezek. 9: 4) No holding back for these ministers now! Rather, ‘through the city’ they go ‘setting the mark’ by preaching the Kingdom message and proclaiming God’s vengeance against this godless generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Worldly die-hards set their foreheads like flint against the warning message of his ministers. Nevertheless, there are multitudes of men of good-will toward God that ‘sigh and cry’ and turn with disappointment from this doomed system. Gladly they receive the figurative “mark” of perception and acceptance of Kingdom truth. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">These</span><span class="font1"> are the ones Jehovah’s ministers will seek to assist during “Setting the Mark” Testimony Period, in December, first by presenting the month’s offer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font1"> and one 32-page booklet, preferably </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People,</span><span class="font1"> on a 35c contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaching a New Peak of Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not only acceptance of the “mark” of truth, but confession thereof is required. Therefore a new peak of publishers is in keeping with the December Testimony Period. If each company will strive to reach its monthly quota based on a 10-percent increase over last year’s average, a new peak can be reached in December. True, it is a bad month in many parts of the country because of winter's setting in. Still, those having the “mark” will not permit cold weather to chill their burning zeal to witness to the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In order to reach tins new high, all ministers must co-operate in assisting irregular and inactive brethren, as well as new publishers, to &quot;set the mark’. To this end a full month of Theocratic ministry should be arranged by each company. The holiday season provides a splendid opportunity in this respect. Organized house-to-house group witnessing will be arranged. Magazine street work will also be appropriate, for thousands of persons will be engaged in holiday shopping. Also, advertising of public meetings will occupy its rightful place in reaching the peak. See that not one person associated is omitted in the invitation to ‘set the mark’ in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another avenue of increasing the number of publishers locally is through book studies, for from home Bible studies new publishers enter the service. Ministers should not fail to call back on all literature ob-tainers and endeavor to establish a book or booklet study. Additionally, many interested persons with whom publishers have been studying now have the “mark” firmly set in their minds and are themselves prepared for service. But how can the matter of service be presented to book-study interest? Begin laying the groundwork for field activity well in advance. Emphasize points pertaining to service considered in the study; read </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> field experiences from time to time and discuss them; and, of course, relate experiences you enjoy in the local territory. Then, wheu the time is ripe, the alert minister can tactfully approach the matter of field service with ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Setting the Mark” Service Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Early in December each company will devote one service meeting to a discussion of reaching a peak of publishers locally. A consideration of the main article in the December </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> will strike the theme of the meeting and can be followed by a practical demonstration on assisting others in the ‘marking’ work. Experiences on aiding book-study interest to enter field service can be related, as well as having new ministers tell what supplied the needed spark that caused them to engage in Kingdom service. Outlining in detail the activity of the company in December will bring to a close the “Setting the Mark” service meeting. Properly planned, prepared and executed, it will give impetus to your efforts to reach a new publisher peak. By each one’s taking advantage of December’s full schedule of Kingdom activity, a peak of publishers can be reached.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Student Talks to Have Wide Variety of Subjects</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">How favored is the lot of Jehovah’s ministers to be living in this day of Jehovah and share in the vindication of his great name through their ministry! No wonder the apostle Paul admonishes us to earnestly desire the better gift of prophecy, of preaching the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The gift of prophecy that Jehovah bestows by means of the holy spirit must be cultivated by diligent study and consistent application in the held. To aid us in this the Lord has provided the company meetings, including the school in Theocratic ministry. During the past year ami a half our studies in the textbook </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work” </span><span class="font1">and Bible-chapter reading have equipped us to better preach to skeptics, religious people, yes, to everyone. As this study now draws to a close alert ministers are asking, What next?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our next textbook will be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers. </span><span class="font1">It contains a wealth of practical information indispensable to the minister who takes seriously his commission to preach. True, we have studied it before; but how much has been forgotten in the three and a half years since we studied the first lesson! It will be profitable for us, as well as the many new ministers who have joined our ranks since then, to reconsider this textbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New School Schedule</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With the November </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> is being sent a new speaking and</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Personal Subscriptions</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">A number of publishers have asked whether they can renew their personal subscriptions for more than one year. This is perfectly all right and in many cases preferable. Renewals for two, three, four or five years save the publisher and the Society the trouble of handling the renewal each year and the expense of sending separate money orders is avoided. Furthermore, the possibility of interruption of magazine service during the process of renewing is eliminated. If the subscription is for more than one year, the number of years should be plainly indicated in the space between “1 year” and “6 months” on the renewal or new subscription slip. If the subscription is to be in a language other than English, show the language at the top right-hand corner of the slip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It will assist the Society if all the publishers will send tlieir personal new and renewal subscriptions through the company. Care should be used to see that the handwriting is legible and that an accurate mailing address is furnished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the future the personal subscriptions of those who are entering the pioneer ranks will not be canceled. Their subscriptions will be allowed to continue the same as any other subscriber and may either be renewed or allowed to expire, depending upon the desire of the pioneer. Of course, it is not necessary lesson schedule, one for each publisher, which schedule begins with the week of November 28. To properly prepare for the lessons in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers </span><span class="font1">everyone should carefully study the first two chapters. Further, it would be well to have the school servant scheduled on the service meeting immediately preceding the first lesson to discuss the first chapter, which calls attention to the value and need of studying this textbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As noted on the school schedule, the first and second student speakers will take tlieir assignments from the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New</span><span class="font1"> World, speaking on the subjects listed and from the pages or chapters given. The third speaker will alternate between any secondary article in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font1">and the main article in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font1">After </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> has been covered only the first speaker will take his material from the next bound book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font1"> while the second speaker will alternate between the main and any secondary article in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> and the third between the principal and any secondary article in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> Where the principal article in a certain issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> is considered under more than one main title heading (as in tiie September 1 and 15, 1948, issues), the subject as a whole is to be considered by the student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each student talk, still from six to eight minutes in length, is to be complete in itself, with introduction, body and conclusion, even though the assignment may be only a part of a chapter. While originality may for pioneers to subscribe if they </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font1">not wish to do so. They may continue to retain one of the seven copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font1"> for their personal study and files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those pioneers who do have personal subscriptions should keep in mind that each time they change their address it will be necessary to send in a separate change of address slip to notify the subscription department. This slip (L-201), which is used ONLY for magazine subscription address changes, ean be obtained from the companies or ordered along with other supplies from the Society. Changes of address for pioneer subscribers will not be made from the pioneer change of address slip (SP-2) which all pioneers will continue to use as in the past. It is used only for pioneer mail and the seven copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> which are handled by a department different from that taking care of subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">be displayed in the choice of the introduction and conclusion, the body of the talk should be limited to the assigned material. In fact, it should be in the nature of an epitome, readily recognized by those familiar with the material. (Circuit servants, when lining up circuit assembly programs, will merely indicate “Selection from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower”,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> as the case may be, where no subject title is listed on the schedule.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And what about the written reviews? They will be continued as heretofore except that the questions will be limited to the lessons in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers.</span><span class="font1"> Generally, written reviews will cover five such lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Doing Our Part</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This new beginning in the school will furnish a good occasion for the school servant to point out to students who have become lax their privileges in connection with the school as well as to encourage new ones to enroll. This includes persons of good-will desirous of increasing tlieir knowledge and preparing themselves for the Kingdom ministry. Much study will be required of the school servant in order to properly counsel on coverage of subject, accuracy of statement, and whether or not the main points have been properly stressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Students will contribute their part by working diligently on their talks. Begin studying as soon as you receive your assignment, make an outline, keep thinking about it and discuss it with others. Aim to give the most representative coverage of tiie material that the time will permit, develop your theme coherently so that it will be easy to follow and make tiie presentation as interesting as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The entire company should study the lesson in tiie textbook and then take part in the oral review. Give the student speaker respectful and close attention. And even though tiie material from the bound books will not be used in the written review, endeavor to read tiie assigned pages or chapters beforehand. Also, you should take the written review regularly, for it is to your benefit. Finally, seek to apply in the field what you have heard, for that, after all, is the purpose of the school. Doing so, you will be earnestly desiring and cultivating the better gift of prophecy, to Jehovah’s praise and the salvation of creatures loving righteousness.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Work for Peak of Publishers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Theocracy’s advance is on among the nations! The irresistible onward march of true worship spreads over the earth. With trustworthy assurance that “lie [Jehovah] it is that shall tread down our enemies”, unparalleled numbers of Jehovah's fearless ministers in all nations ‘do valiantly through God’, advancing knowledge and instruction in the interests of the Kingdom. Such advance-minded publishers cherish the opportunity to share in Theocratic progress, and rejoice at the prospects of advancement afforded all publishers of truth in the “Axl Nations Advance” Testimony Period in April.—Psalm 60-: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Advance the “Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">April marks the final month of the 1948 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign, during which a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> for one dollar, with a premium of eight booklets, is the offer. Older booklets included in combinations should not discourage booklet distribution, for much timely information is to be had in all such publications. During April every truth-advancer will put forth an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">added</span><span class="font2"> effort to forward the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign. Why? A count of subscriptions for the first two months reveals that we are 10,000 subscriptions behind last year, or 5,000 fewer subscriptions per month have 'been obtained this year as compared with 1947. True, severe winter months hampered campaign activity. But the most inclement weather has passed. Therefore, in April we shall make every endeavor to regain the loss incurred. If some publishers feel they can effectively present the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions together, they are at liberty to do so. With additional effort we can meet the 300,000 subscription quota and give the 1948 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">campaign a fitting climax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By April many subscriptions that were obtained in 1947 will have expired. Necessarily, the “All Nations Advance” will include following up these expired subscriptions, as well as new ones, and encouraging home </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies. Back-call servants should make certain that expiration slips received from the Society are cared for immediately. It is not our desire to simply obtain 300,000 new subscriptions, but we hope to have subscribers who have been on the list for the past few years continue Theocratic advance by renewing their </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Advance the Peak of Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Indeed, a new peak in number of publishers is in keeping with the April advance In all nations. Doubtless, new publishers advancing to active field service during the impetus-giving Memorial week-end in March will desire to continue their Kingdom service. These should be heartily encouraged to extend their activity into April, which can be the biggest month of the year for new publishers. In doing this, servants and regular publishers will co-operate and arrange to offer needed assistance to new publishers, as well as the irregular and inactive. The “All Nations Advance” Testimony Period will be an excellent time to invite good-will interest to progress to public truth-advancing. Tactfully invite them to accompany you in the service work and then aid them in every way possible to continue therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another avenue of advance, which will aid in effecting an all-time high in number of publishers, is the new public meeting series. Together, all will enthusiastically support the new 1948 series of public talks by thoroughly advertising the lectures in the field, attending the meeting and welcoming the stranger. If your company has not already done so, arrange to start the interesting and timely new series of public talks in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Further, April is a splendid month to take the forward step to pioneer service. On hearing the new pioneer arrangement outlined by the Society’s president at the Philadelphia convention, many advance-minded publishers joyfully looked forward to spring, when their affairs could be set in order and they could enter the full-time service. Well, April is here! And the Society feels that many expansion-minded ministers, having prayerfully considered their personal pioneer letters, will find it possible to enter the full-time ranks, contributing toward the 10-percent goal, and a hoped-for peak of pioneers in this country. Moreover, those so doing will certainly do their share in reaching a new high in number of company publishers in April. How? Brethren advancing to the pioneer ranks will naturally devote more time to Kingdom service, and hence will be able to assist more individuals in entering field activity. Pioneers can also be a great help in aiding weak publishers in the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let each one of us, therefore, assume a direct interest in a new peak in number of publishers; plan and work toward that end in your company, advancing beyond your company’s present all-time high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">April is superabounding with opportunities to advance Theocratically. In all nations Jehovah’s servants unitedly join in Theocracy’s onward march during the concluding month of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font2"> campaign, the “All Nations Advance” Testimony Period.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Study Third Personal Pioneer Letter</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">All consecrated witnesses recognize the desirability of devoting full time to the service of Jehovah. Consequently their thoughts dwell upon their own personal circumstances and each day some find it possible to take the forward step into the pioneer service. Even so, the Society feels the same responsibility that Peter did when he wrote, &quot;Wherefore, I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them.” It is to put you in remembrance of things already known that a third letter of invitation to pioneer service is being sent to each publisher with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> As you individually read it, may it bring to mind the practicability of the pioneer work and possible ways for you to engage therein. It will also be considered by the entire company as were the previous letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Spirited discussion awakens new ideas and instills determination in the servant whose circumstances make pioneering possible. Accordingly, in addition to the discussion of the third letter during one service meeting, another service meeting during April should stress the privilege of pioneering. During that meeting, outstanding points from all three pioneer letters can be considered, either by short talks, discussions between two or more individuals, questions and answers, or by demonstrations. Include experiences on pioneering also. These can be personal experiences of local pioneers or some taken from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and the 1948 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font2"> By giving careful thought and diligence in preparation, it should be possible to have a very interesting and helpful service meeting program based on the pioneer work. Perhaps, through this medium, publishers from your company will be aided to advance into the pioneer ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Vacation Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is no doubt that the coming of spring will witness an encouraging increase in the number of pioneers. During the summer months, working side by side with these regular pioneers, will be the vacation pioneers, boys and girls who wisely recognize that their early years can most profitably be spent serving their Creator, and adults whose vacation periods permit expanded service. Now is the time for you to start making plans so that when vacation comes there will be no delay. Mature publishers can do much to encourage the young folks and help them get started on a sound basis. Vacation pioneering might also be given some attention in the pioneer service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All publishers, then, whether old or young, remember the pioneer service. Plan with faith, strive constantly to remedy those things that hinder, and, above all, look to Jehovah for his aid that you may attain to this blessed service.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>District Assembly</span></h1>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Atlanta Assemblers Richly Blessed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">From ’Wheeling, West Virginia, on the north to Key West, Florida, on the south, and from western Kentucky to the Atlantic ocean, witnesses streamed to the focal point of Atlanta, Georgia, March 12-14, for the first of a series of district assemblies in 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The assembly was held in the spacious Municipal Auditorium. The entire main floor was filled for the opening meetings Friday morning by publishers desirous of reaping full benefits from the assembly. Over 5,000 were present Saturday, and attendance for the public meeting Sunday swelled to 6,665 as people of good-will from Atlanta joined with Jehovah’s witnesses to hear Brother Knorr deliver “The Kingdom Hope of All Mankind”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the opening words of the chairman Friday afternoon to Brother Knorr’s concluding remarks Sunday evening, the program was brimful with choice food from the Lord, each portion bringing something new and strengthening as it was presented by the president or other representatives of the Society. The audience gave rapt attention throughout, showing their appreciation with repeated applause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Practical Instruction</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Throughout all sessions notebooks had been very much in evidence as the interested listeners recorded information from the talks, demonstrations and experiences for use by themselves and those at home who had been unable to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The district assembly, in addition to proving most profitable to the publishers, gave an effective witness to the friendly city of Atlanta, one newspaper reporting, &quot;Jehovah’s witnesses Tranquil in a War-torn World.” Happy smiles and joyful voices gave evidence of keen appreciation of the table Jehovah had spread for them. Many expressions such as these were heard: “It was the most practical assembly I have ever attended.” “This is just what our company needed.” Not least among the joyful events were the thrilling experiences of pioneers. The innumerable ways that the Lord provides for these faithful servants to continue in the full-time service was very inspiring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yes, Jehovah had gathered his people for a purpose and they had drunk deeply of the refreshing spiritual truths and practical instructions. As they departed for their homes, whether in populous cities, villages or secluded mountain regions, all felt better equipped and anxious to get back to the field to put into practice those things they had learned. Similar provisions await the brethren in other sections as conventions for their districts are held. Plan now to be among them.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>'‘Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to Be Offered</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In spite of all the efforts of men to gain health and life, the human race continues on its downward course. Why? Because they ignore the only means of health and life, a knowledge of Jehovah and his Son, Christ Jesus. Those who have this knowledge and are wise will impart it to others, even as the text for the month of May states: “The tongue of the wise is health. The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.”—Prov. 12:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the tongue to be health, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">what </span><span class="font2">we say, though the truth, is not enough. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">How</span><span class="font2"> we say it is also important ; our speech must be in accordance with the wisdom that comes from above. It should be friendly, gracious, kind, judicious and persuasive. (See Proverbs 16: 21,23, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.')</span><span class="font2"> We should try to develop that sensitive mental discernment, Theocratic tactfulness, which helps to analyze each situation, and then adjust our speech accordingly. And having struck a spark of interest, hold it by conversing on the level of the people. Remember, they know nothing of the truth, and therefore if they are to grasp what we have to say we must proceed simply and slowly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Starting Book Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In many companies less than a third of the publishers conduct book studies. To improve this situation the starting of book studies will be featured during May. Usually, before we can start a book study we must first place the book with the people, and therefore during the month of May the wise will use their tongues in presenting the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font2"> together with the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of thirty-five cents. If unable to place the bound book make a special effort to leave the booklet on their promise to read it. if they are unable to contribute. Every home should have a copy of this joyful and timely message. Should there be some who promised to subscribe for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> during April, but were unable to do so then, you may still give them the benefit of the special offer of the year’s subscription and eight booklets on a contribution of one dollar during May. However, for all regular house-to-house activity the bound book and booklet will be presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Having found interest, be sure to make a note of it on your house-to-house record, and then call back so as to give further health-giving information. During May there will also be much back-call work done in connection with those who subscribed during the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign, as well as with those who subscribed a year ago and have allowed their subscription to expire. These expiration slips are now being sent to the companies. Regardless of the occasion of the back-call, be prepared and equipped to discuss a specific subject with them, one in which you have reason to believe they will be interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All back-call activity should be engaged in with the goal in mind of starting a book study, for book studies result in publishers. The wise will be tactful in this also. Some are eager to learn. With these a book study can be started on the first or second back-call. Others have only a slight interest, which must first be fanned into a flame before they will appreciate the need of regular study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Having started a book study, the tongue of the wise will be careful to use tact when difficult situations arise. When an error is stated dogmatically, Instead of flatly contradicting, pose a question, such as: “If that be true, I wonder what the apostle Paul meant when he said ‘Let no man judge you regarding the sabbath’? Such judicious speech will go far in giving health to the hearers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Other opportunities afforded the wise to let their tongues be health come in calling out appropriate slogans in the street magazine work, extending cheery invitations to passers-by, together with the handbills, giving a hearty welcome to the stranger that comes to hear the talk, and, for some, the added privilege of giving the public talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the month of May, and at all times, let us show our love for Jehovah, for righteousness, for life and for our neighbor by using our tongues wisely in every feature of Kingdom service. Thereby our tongues will be health not only to others, but also to ourselves, for we shall realize the promise that “the lip of truth shall be established for ever”.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The Kingdom Hall</span></h1>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>A Clean Place of Pure Worship</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">More than anything else the people of today need a knowledge of the Kingdom. To partly fill this need, Kingdom Halls have been established in cities and towns from coast to coast. It is at the Kingdom Hall where true ministers, young and old, are thoroughly equipped to expand the Kingdom witness to the ends of their territory. It is at the Kingdom Hall, and not any imposing religious edifice, where good-will persons may assemble with a Christian congregation to learn the way to life under the Kingdom. Indeed, the Kingdom Hall, regardless of size or location, assumes its proper place as the most important structure in the community ; it is directly related to the peace, freedom and eternal life-interests of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In their Kingdom ministry Jehovah’s witnesses deport themselves always in keeping with the Scriptural admonition to be clean in speech, habits and dress. Necessarily, this trait should be reflected in the appearance of their Kingdom Halls. The very name “Kingdom Hall”, in fact, denotes a clean place of pure worship. Does your Kingdom Hall live up to its name? Is it truly clean at all times, comfortable and inviting to publishers, new interest, and the public? What is the impression your Kingdom Hall will make upon a truth-seeker visiting the company for the first time? Surely every company values highly its Kingdom Hall, whether owned or rented, as a provision intended to honor Jehovah's name and bring much benefit to all who enter its doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Maintaining a Presentable Kingdom Hall</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Keeping the Kingdom Hall attractive and inviting requires diligent care. Chairs, for example, should be arranged and dusted before meetings; floors swept and washed as often as needed. Walls and ceiling ought to look presentable. Kingdom literature deserves the best of treatment, placed neatly in the stock</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>All Features of Service Bring Blessings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">There is no boredom in serving Jehovah. Even as he has provided an infinite variety in his inanimate creation, he places a well-balanced, varied service program in the hands of his witnesses, each of which fills </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> definite need. Diligent servants, upon learning of their service charge, recall the words of the wise man who said, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Whatsoever</span><span class="font2"> thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.” (Eccl. 9:10) They wisely refrain from slighting any feature of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our Leader, Christ Jesus, set an excellent example for us in this respect. “Whatsoever” avenue of preaching opened itself to him he seized readily and performed with his might. He took part in the house-to-house work, made back-calls, instructed small groups in the privacy of their homes, shared in public meeting activity and was found magnifying Jehovah's kingdom in the streets and market places. Because he did so he conveyed blessings to persons in all walks of life and was richly rewarded by his Father. We do well to thus participate in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font2"> feature of the service, and this we can do through Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">room and kept free from dirt. Orderly placement of equipment, such as desks, tables, maps and files, will also add to the hall’s appearance, in addition to aiding servants in handling their duties efficiently. The Theocratic ministry library, too, requires attention, while the company chart will need care in the mounting of figures. If your hall provides for a Kingdom window advertisement, tasteful displays, kept neat and changed regularly, will catch the eye, silently witness to passers-by, and help to make the outside presentable. An identifying “Kingdom Hall” sign may be displayed, while, within, a neat yeartext at the front, focusing constant attention on our service theme, plays its part in making each hall truly a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font2"> Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Maintaining a presentable Kingdom Hall necessitates co-operation among publishers. The hall is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yours. </span><span class="font2">Why not, then, share in making your hall best serve Its purpose? Caring for it is a Theocratic service. The greater<sup>-</sup> the number able and willing to have part in this service, the less of a responsibility will be laid on a few. Brethren may volunteer to serve in this respect, and the company servant can arrange a schedule that will provide for the satisfactory maintenance of the hall. Children, also, can prove co-operative. And during all meetings younger brethren, being trained for a full life as God’s ministers, will be just as attentive and orderly as older publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Kingdom Hall is indeed an assembly place for pure worship. May your hall fully serve its purpose as Jehovah’s true ministers and persons of good-will gather regularly to increase in knowledge of the King and the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By following this Christlike and proper course you gain the greatest possible fruitage from your service and bring blessings to yourself and others. As you go from door to door you meet people in their homes where they are relaxed and are more apt to have a moment to discuss the Bible. Through conversation they can better judge your frankness and honesty and they have a fuller opportunity to see and select literature that appeals to them. Meantime you are learning to be versatile in your presentation and experience the joys of finding the “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The need for calling back on the people is as great today as it was when Christ called back at the home of Martha and Mary. At these back-calls and book studies the new ones grow in understanding as you carefully feed them. But both the student and the instructor learn through this systematic method of study. You will profit too from looking up and answering questions; and is it not a blessing to see their progress and to enjoy the satisfaction of assisting new publishers into the field? Those blessings are available to all who follow the lead of Christ in back-call and study activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus brought blessings to great multitudes of people by carrying on public meetings for their benefit. Today the public meetings still furnish a rapid means of acquainting large numbers of people with the truth. And it affords you an excellent opportunity to show real love for the stranger. At our meetings men of good-will are blessed by the message that they hear and by their association with others who love righteousness. As you offer handbills and magazines on the streets you serve people who might otherwise be deprived of the truth. Street and public meeting activity have a place in every community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus, all features of the work go hand in hand. Each is necessary, both to persons of good-w’ill and to those who would follow the leadings of Christ. Individual publishers will be greatly aided if the company arranges for each feature of the service to receive due attention. Has your company, or have you as an individual publisher, been concentrating on some features of the work to the exclusion of others? If so, begin today to include all features of the work in your service program, doing each with your might as unto the Lord. So doing, you will bring a blessing to yourself and to those you serve.</span></p>

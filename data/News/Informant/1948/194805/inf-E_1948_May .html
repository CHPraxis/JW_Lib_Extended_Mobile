</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Back-Call and Book-Study Activity to Be Stressed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The tongue is a little member, but even though small, it is difficult to tame. When used unwisely it is capable of inflicting deep wounds and stirring strife. But when used wisely, the tongue of a Kingdom publisher brings health to himself and others and praise to Jehovah. In the words of our text for this month, “There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health. The lip of truth shall be established forever : but a lying tongue is but for a moment.” (Prov. 12:18, 19) Indeed, “death and life are in the power of the tongue.” Hence, the publisher who wants health and life for himself and others will make wise use of the tongue during May, presenting the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font1"> together with the booklet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People,</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of 35c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In presenting the month’s offer, wise and faithful ambassadors will apply instruction received through the service meetings and Theocratic ministry school. A wise, healthy tongue is a tactful tongue, kind, considerate, helpful. To use it aright, converse with the people on points of agreement, showing how </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font1"> will aid them to get further information on subjects they are interested in. These subjects can be readily learned by courteously allowing them to use their tongues to express themselves. Our ministry at the doors is a conversational one, not the delivery of a lecture. Barriers and stumbling stones can be gathered out of the way and much literature placed by wise use of the tongue in our house-to-house ministry during May, and the way opened up for further education of people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls and Studies Essential</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The truth is not generally learned in one day or by the casual reading of a book. It takes time, effort and the assistance of an equipped minister. Back-calls and book studies are essential. Here the faithful ambassador can regularly bring the healing words of the Great Physician to those of good-will. And as each succeeding lesson in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font1"> is carefully studied, they are brought closer to the point where their lips, too, can speak truth and be established forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let your tongue be used wisely during May, then, by calling back on each person who has obtained </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Ue True”,</span><span class="font1"> or only the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People,</span><span class="font1"> or even where interest was shown but no literature placed. Call back also on those whose subscriptions have expired; stir interest in the magazine and seek to start home studies. As notices are received by the companies they should be distributed to the publishers and called on promptly. Remember, if they resubscribe, the subscriptions can be counted as new.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some people of good-will may have been unable to subscribe to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> during the four-month campaign. Although the special subscription offer is not to be featured from door-to-door during May, we may give those who have desired subscriptions and those on our back-call lists the benefit of the eightbooklet premium. Every effort should be made to complete this final cleanup of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> campaign early in the month, so that the subscriptions can be in the hands of the Society by May jo, and thus be counted in the campaign totals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings Aid Back-Calls and Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By this time we should all be well along in our new public meeting campaign. Companies that use the tongue wisely in this feature of the service are almost always healthy in other features as well. Careful coverage of territory means that more good-will persons will be visited and more </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font1"> will be placed, resulting in added opportunities for back-calls and studies. Do not wait until interest has begun to wane before making such calls. Go back the next week. Give them an invitation to the current lecture. Then, by wise use of the tongue, fan the spark of interest into flame. By the time the two-week back-call activity arrives, many of those not really interested will have been determined, permitting special attention to be given to those manifesting real interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Let God Be True” Service Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After having spent four months presenting magazines and booklets, a service meeting during May devoted to the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font1"> will be beneficial. Parts on the program may include a discussion of talking points on the book, demonstrations to illustrate its presentation, information on following up placements of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font1"> or how to present it to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscribers. Wise tongues can also be taught to start book studies. There is a wealth of material which alert servants can work into this meeting, presenting it in a variety of ways, so that it will be interesting and profitable to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let the month of May, then, be one in which the tongue of the wise publisher is kept busy bringing health, leaving no time for things which cut life prospects to ‘but a moment’. How wise it is to use the lip for truth and ‘be established forever’ I</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>117,311 Attend the Memorial</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">What cause for rejoicing! A new all-time high, exceeding our previous peak of last April by almost three thousand publishers! And not only that—reports at hand indicate that lands to the north, south, east and ■west of us have likewise attained new peaks during March. What an increase in Kingdom service, in praise given to Jehovah God, in comfort brought to men of goodwill ! And how the Devil and his demons must gnash their teeth in rage as they note this glorious expansion of the true worship!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What brought about these results? First of all servants of Jehovah God prayed for an increase, and then they backed up that prayer by a consistent course of action. Servants in the companies properly organized the company activity, and the regular and mature publishers co-operated by aiding the new, the weak and the irregular ones to have a part in the service. It is now</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>New Booklet Released</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Prepare Now for Wide Distribution</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">A new booklet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations,</span><span class="font1"> will be used during the July and August campaign. Announcement is now made so that supplies can be ordered in advance. A quota of 25 booklets per publisher and 100 per pioneer for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">each</span><span class="font1"> of the two months has been set. Thus the quota for the two-month campaign will be 50 booklets for each company publisher and 200 for each pioneer. It would be well for the company servant, before ordering, to check by a raising of hands how many publishers are willing to assume this quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each week the stock servant can advise the company servant how many of the new booklets have gone into the hands of the publishers, and this figure can be announced weekly at the service meeting. This will allow a close check on whether sufficient booklets to meet the quota set are getting into the hands of the publishers. Additional effort should be put forth when the quota is lagging. There is nothing gained by having the booklets accumulate in the homes of the publishers; hence, let’s leave a copy in every house where it will be read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations</span><span class="font1"> is a 32-page booklet. It contains an address given by Brother Knorr to large audiences in London, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. This subject has since been discussed by district servants at circuit assemblies throughout the world. Now all publishers can share in taking this information direct to the people in their homes. During this “election year” its message is particularly timely and important. Order early, so that all may share fully in Its distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">possible to rejoice at these results, because the activity was reported. And so, the publishers having planted and watered, God gave the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What now? Having made such good progress, shall we slack the hand? Unthinkable! There are thousands of others in this land who would take sides with Jehovah if but given the opportunity, and there are literally millions who have not been witnessed to in years. So, let us show our appreciation of the Lord’s blessings upon our efforts by endeavoring not only to hold on to the gains made but also to push forward toward further expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The report of the attendance at the Memorial celebration is also cause for rejoicing, since upward of 11,500 more attended this year than last. (A check reveals that by the time the Memorial report was closed, 91 percent of the companies had reported. What would the total have been if all company servants had sent in their reports promptly?)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Renewal blanks are sent to each </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoioer</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> subscriber prior to expiration of subscriptions. These blanks should be filled in completely and sent in at the time of renewal, making sure to note any recent change of address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It will be of even greater assistance to the Society if you will pin or paste to the renewal blank a recent address label from your magazine or its wrapper. All essential information, such as name, address, zone number, etc., appears on each address label. The expiration symbol, such as W 8 48 or G 9 48, should also appear on the label you select to send in with your renewal slip. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoioer</span><span class="font1"> magazine is denoted by W and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> by G. The numerals denote the month and year of expiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When writing the Society asking for a change of address or making other inquiries as to your own or another’s subscription, the matter can be more quickly handled if you will attach the address label to your card or letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Subscribers in other countries will, of course, send renewal blanks to their respective Branch ofiices.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>“Neighbor Love”</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Display Love Throu</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Welcoming the Stranger Essential</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">This world has utterly forsaken Jehovah’s righteous rule of action: ■‘Love thy neighbor as thyself.” Hence, hate, greed, lying, terror and Godlessness form the pattern of life in this doomed old world. However, love, generosity, faith, truthfulness, and Godliness order the steps of Jehovah’s New World ministers, whose lives are governed by genuine “neighbor love”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Universal hatred, characteristic of Satan’s crumbling organization, casts mankind into a whirlpool of warmongering, hate propaganda and wholesale slaughter. On the other hand, sincere “neighbor love” finds its expression through the worldwide ministry of Jehovah’s witnesses in preaching the life-giving Kingdom gospel. Is there any better way to demonstrate love of “thy neighbor” than by preaching the gospel of peace and life? Of course not! Then preach we will during the “Neighbor Love” Testimony Period in June by our actions supporting God’s own rule: “Love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the Lobd.” —Leviticus 19:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Expressing Love</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Just as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font1"> received a knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes through patient, loving instruction in God's Word, so we should unselfishly afford our </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">neighbors</span><span class="font1"> the same opportunity. During June the first step to this desired end will be presenting the offer, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People,</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of thirty-five cents. Where </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font1"> cannot be placed, endeavor to leave a copy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">TJie Joy of All the People.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Through the diligent efforts of all Kingdom publishers, many bound books will be placed during the twomonth campaign of May and June, and a solid, basic foundation laid for back-call activity. Then, call back with a purpose on every placement. The purpose? To establish home Bible book studies! With the comprehensive Bible coverage of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font1"> its thought-provoking questions and with a full knowledge of its contents, active Theocratic publishers should not encounter difficulty in starting home Bible studies in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shortly it will be time for all companies to express their “neighbor love” by calling on our rural friends, some of whom have uot been visited since last summer. Much work was accomplished then and much literature placed. During the winter months our out-of-town neighbors who took literature have had ample opportunity to examine it. Hence, the time is now ripe for all companies holding rural territory to start organizing for rural activity at convenient times throughout the month. The better summer weather will permit a more diligent and expansive follow-up of interest in rural communities. Attend to this, and try to start studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Welcoming the Stranger</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">God’s ministers ‘forsake not assembling together’, for they love the fellowship of associating with one another and appreciate the rich spiritual benefit received from attending all company meetings, public meetings and assemblies. Necessarily, in loving our neighbor as ourselves we keenly desire to have them enjoy the same benefits and blessings by at-</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">tending these meetings. Therefore, a cordial invitation to attend all meetings will be extended persons of good-will. But our mission of love does not conclude there. No; we must welcome the stranger at these meetings. This is the privilege of every publisher, with the advertising servant setting a proper example. (See </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font1"> paragraph 88.) At the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">study he should make certain that all visitors coming to the hall for the first several times are provided with a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> magazine, or introduce them to publishers with magazines so they can receive full benefit from the study. Publishers should always be alert to cheerfully extend a warm, sincere welcome to new interest. Converse freely with them, but do not monopolize the conversation. Introduce them to other publishers. Make a tour of the Kingdom Hall, explaining the various departments. If you are welcoming strangers at a public meeting. arrange for back-calls, offer to call for them on the occasion of the next public or company meeting. Really display your &quot;neighbor love” by welcoming the stranger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Unlike the greedy, hate-breeding organizations of this world, Jehovah’s witnesses will display their unselfish devotion to their Maker and fellow men by applying the righteous rule of action, “love thy neighbor as thyself.” in all features of Kingdom activity during the “Neighbor Love” Testimony Period in June. Will you share therein?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>1948 District Assemblies</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Divine Provision for Enlightenment</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The grand procession of district assemblies scheduled for 1948 is a part of the majestic organization of Jehovah, directed by his holy spirit. They are moving forward to accomplish his purposes, dispelling the gloom of religion and superstition engulfing persons of good-will and bringing comfort and cheer to all valiant soldiers of the King Eternal. Attendants will be instructed, enlightened and equipped to be better Theocratic ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">World-wide District Assembly Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The recent district assembly at Atlanta, Georgia, the first for the United States, was acclaimed by all in attendance as one of the most practical and Instructive assemblies ever conducted. The next one is scheduled for Houston, Texas, May 7-9, to be followed by the Oakland. California, assembly, May 28-30. But the benefits of district assemblies are not for one locality or one country. North, south, east and west, Canada. Alaska, Mexico, Central and South America will likewise receive this shower of Jehovah’s blessings as will many of the other continents and the isles of the sea. Surely the Lord’s organization cannot stand accused of neglecting to assemble together. ‘and so much the more as the final day approaches.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Most of these assemblies will be more difficult to attend than a circuit assembly, because of the greater areas involved. But any such disadvantages will be more than offset by what is gained in return. Jehovah is no waster. Since it is he who provides such assemblies, it cannot be considered a waste of money and time to attend. There will be a table</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Have You Fully Coi</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>The Pioneer Rai</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Join the Joyful Throng</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah’s blessing has been manifest in the gratifying response to letters inviting publishers to take up the pioneer service. The growing list of pioneers has not come from the ranks of young single persons alone. Many of the new pioneers are married, some with families and other obligations. Convinced that Satan’s old world is on the way out, they have resolved to no longer spend time unnecessarily in old-world pursuits. Instead, they are now spending their time and energy wholly to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But our quota has not yet been reached. There are many more who can and should be pioneers. Earnestly and prayerfully weigh all the points involved, and perhaps you, too, may make this decisive Theocratic step. Many have written in to tell us that their previous objections and excuses have been completely broken down by the Scriptural reasons advanced for pioneering, leaving them with but the one course: become a pioneer. And this course they have joyfully followed with full appreciation that pioneering is not ‘just another job’, but a full-time service that will bring forth Jehovah’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Joy of the Full-Time Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many expressions of joy are constantly being received from those now enlisted as pioneers. This does not mean, however, that pioneering is an easy life. Without doubt, many spread that will be well worth the added effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And what are some of the things to be expected that will be of such value? Do you sometimes feel that you need additional instruction in house-to-house witnessing? that your efforts, though diligent, are not accomplishing as much as they should? Such instruction will be given at the district assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Or, perhaps your difficulty lies in making back-calls or getting book studies started. If so, you should not fail to attend the district assembly. All features of the service will receive their fair share of attention, including street-work and public meeting activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Others are seeking a remedy for poor meeting attendance or company difficulties. What are the basic causes for poor attendance at meetings? Can they be overcome? Is there any practical way to erase company difficulties and work together in unison? Who could fail to profit by hearing representatives of the Society present information on these Important matters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It will be Impossible for one to retain all of the practical information there presented. It would be wise, therefore, to come prepared to take extensive notes, so that you can apply the instructions in the field, as well as share things learned with persons of good-will and publishers who were unable to attend. Undoubtedly, you will want to jot down suggestions on handling your service meetings and the main points of demonstrations and experiences, as well as material presented in the various talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theocratic service instruction, divine enlightenment, comfort and many other blessings await you at your district assembly. Are you putting forth every effort to be there? No one who is able to attend can afford to miss the 1948 district assemblies.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>isidered Pioneering?</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>iks Are Growing</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">who write of their happiness have also had difficult experiences. They may have had to do without what many consider the necessities of comfortable living. They certainly have had to bear the reproach that comes to those taking Jehovah’s side. But these things have not robbed them of their joy. Why? Because, basically, their joy comes from the consciousness of being used by Jehovah as one of his full-time ambassadors. This joy is enhanced by doing the most possible in God’s service and carefully avoiding the old-world practice of getting by with the least possible effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even though all in a family cannot become pioneers, effort can be made to enable at least one to do so. If aid is thus provided by family members, the way may be opened up for many more to enroll. The joys of these pioneers are certain to reflect upon the entire household.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Vacation Pioneer Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Again vacation pioneer time is at hand. Instead of being taught in school, during vacation young ministers oan go out and teach others. By spending the equivalent of school time in field service, six hours a day for five days a week, it will be possible to meet the new reduced quota of 120 hours per month. Undoubtedly, many more young folks will feel capable of meeting this quota and will readily respond. Let your youthful zeal and energy be used in singing praises to God. putting to practical use the things you have learned in Theocratic ministry school and service meetings. When writing for your application, be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sure to so state if it is for vacation pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let all consecrated servants, then, consider pioneer service fully. Whether you enter for two or three months as a vacation pioneer or with the hope of continued pioneer service, your joys are certain to be multiplied at the hand of our bountiful Father, Jehovah.</span></p>

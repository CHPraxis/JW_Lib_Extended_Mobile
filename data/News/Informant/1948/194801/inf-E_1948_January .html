</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>World-wide Quota Set at 300,000 Subscriptions</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">‘‘Keep enlightened the eyes of the heart” (Eph. 1:18,19), is the guiding thought chosen to direct our efforts during January, the first month of our present </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">campaign. One good reason for having the eyes of our heart enlightened is that we ‘may know . . . the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe’. That exceeding great power has sustained His people, held back their enemies, and now opens up the way for an enthusiastic, world-wide presentation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every servant of Jehovah should heed the Commander’s call to field activity in this four-month offensive, thereby obediently and zealously demonstrating to Jehovah that His power is sufficient to make known the truth to others. Not only will we keep the eyes of oub heart enlightened ; we will take </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> to others that their eyes too may be enlightened to Jehovah’s purposes. Since </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is available in many other languages in this country at the same subscription rate as the English, there is added incentive for the widest possible distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Favorable Opportunities</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The very fact that in these difficult times Jehovah has provided us with sufficient paper to meet our magazine needs is evidence that this truth must go out now. With gratitude therefor, you may order all the magazines you actually need. After studying them yourself, give all in your territory, those whom you otherwise contact, and especially everyone who has shown himself of good-will, a like opportunity for enlightenment. Offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">for one year at the subscription rate of one dollar, together with the gift of eight booklets as a premium. Where the people already have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> or for other reasons do not take it, then offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!-,</span><span class="font3"> or if you believe you can place both together, you may do so. (See December </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> for alternative offers. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having engaged in many previous </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaigns, God's people should now be adept at its presentation. Always offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">first, and for the next four months concentrate on getting it into as many homes as possible. Servants can build up enthusiasm for the campaign in all company meetings. Keep the matter before the publishers continually and assist them to effectively present the offer, by showing the best methods in demonstrations and discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If every publisher in the world obtains at least two subscriptions, we should easily reach the worldwide quota of 300,000 subscriptions during the four-month period. Each company should set as its quota a total of double its quota of publishers. Hence, if a company has a quota of 40 publishers, the four-month quota for subscriptions will be 80. Always try to obtain full-year subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All of Jehovah’s people realize that merely obtaining a large number of subscriptions is not the final goal. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> will not actually benefit the people unless it is studied. If it is studied it will enlighten the eyes of those of goodwill, assisting them to shun the old world and associate with God’s people. Our objective, therefore, is to aid the people in carefully studying and then acting upon the message contained in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font3">for by so doing they can be helped to gain everlasting life from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Circuit Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We must not overlook the part that the circuit assemblies will have in this campaign. The third coverage of the circuits is now beginning, and the new lecture, “Permanent Governor of All Nations,” will be widely advertised and given. While at these assemblies, keep the presentation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> to the fore. The instructive service meetings will high-light the most effective ways of so doing. All subscriptions obtained during circuit assemblies should be turned in through the local company organization where the assembly is held, so that the interest can be followed up and properly cared for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So, with eyes fixed steadfastly upon the doing of Jehovah’s will, and with a clear understanding of the purpose of our efforts, let us advance together with a unified front in this four-month offensive for enlightenment.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Sending in Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The prompt handling of subscriptions by this office will be greatly facilitated if the following points are carefully observed:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1. Be sure all names and addresses are correctly shown.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2. Place full name of company on each subscription slip.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">3. Pioneers should place own name on each subscription obtained.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">4. List all subscriptions on the Subscription Record Sheet (S-10).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5. Enclose all subscription slips with Subscription Record Sheet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">6. Enclose covering remittance with all subscriptions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">7. When sending ONLY subscriptions no Remittance Form (S-52) need be used.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">8. Company servant carefully check all enclosures and sign properly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers sending in renewals, either their own or others, should always send them through the company. CAREFULLY CHECK THE SHEET &quot;HOW TO PROPERLY HANDLE SUBSCRIPTIONS ’, previously sent to all companies.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Goal: 10 Percent of Total Publishers Enrolled as Pioneers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Already applications for pioneer service are beginning to come in, accompanied by heartfelt expressions of gratitude and joy. And why shouldn’t they? The hearts of thousands of Jehovah’s servants still beat faster when they recall Brother Knorr’s final talk at the “Song of Praise” Assembly at Philadelphia, during which he announced the new arrangement to assist more publishers to become pioneers, and, having begun, to continue without interruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Quotas Make Part-Time Work Possible</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The rising cost of living and the necessity of providing things decent for self and family has, with many, been one of the chief hindrances to continued pioneer service. The apostle Paul engaged in tent-making activities in order to be self-supporting and “accountable to no man”. Now it will be possible for presentday pioneers to engage in part-time employment to meet their financial needs. It is therefore suggested that each pioneer who finds it necessary obtain some sort of part-time work. He may devote one-half of each day to secular employment, or two or three full days during the week, varying according to individual needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And how will this be possible? Beginning January 1, 1948, quotas for general pioneers will be reduced from 150 to 120 hours per month. That will mean that an average of four hours a day, one hour of which may be travel time, will meet the minimum requirement. Undoubtedly many pioneers will find it possible to exceed this quota, as they have consistently done in the past, and they are encouraged to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The yearly quota of 1400 hours will be established. Thus, if seasonal work is available and desirable, a pioneer may put in 150 or 160 hours for a few months, and then take a full month off to gather sufficient funds for several months to come. In this way the full quota will be reached by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Secular employment should never be allowed to overshadow the work of greatest importance, the preaching of the gospel. The pioneer should set his own quotas so that he will not fall short at the end of the year. The Society will check the records of the pioneers every six months, and if any should not be meeting the quota it will be necessary to write the pioneer about his activity. All should plan from the beginning to work toward the 1400-hour yearly requirement and attain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under this new arrangement, there will be no provision for suspensions. Each person who is on the pioneer list should continue to send in his report monthly, regardless of the number of hours devoted to field service. If the report is below the minimum of 120 hours, the reason should be noted at the bottom of the report. It is understood that each pioneer will devote as much time as possible to field service each month, even though engaged in secular work, for the ministry is his vocation. Back-calls and book studies should never be neglected. If on occasions the pioneer simply cannot care for them, some other arrangement should be made to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Special pioneer quotas will remain the same: 175 hours and 50 back-calls per month. Their yearly quota, however, will be 1800 hours. The service activity of special pioneers will also be checked regularly, to see that they are meeting the yearly quota. There will be no arrangement for suspension as heretofore. If, because of secular or other reasons, they do not meet the requirements, they should, however, report as usual, noting the reason on their reports. As in the past, only the special pioneers who attain their quota of 175 hours and 50 back-calls during the month are eligible for that month’s allowance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Secondary Occupation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All pioneers have in common one primary occupation, that of preaching the gospel. Their secondary occupations, however, designed to enable them to continue in full-time service, may vary. Numerous avenues for part-time employment will open up as each considers his own capacities and the opportunities available in his community. Some are skilled at handicrafts: needlework, leather goods, and the like. Others can work as barbers; parttime stenographers, store clerks or service station attendants. Still others may turn to the harvest fields or odd jobs such as extra hotel work. Brethren who do not have any trade could consider devoting some of their spare time to learning</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">How fitting that Jehovah’s witnesses should choose as their 1948 yeartext David’s words, “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations” ! Indeed, they have real cause for bursting forth into a “song of praise” to their Maker, for the Kingdom is here, Christ is enthroned, and the vindication of Jehovah’s name Is at hand. No praise of men is their song, but rather a song extolling the majesty of the Creator. Throughout the earth their praisegiving song strikes a response in hearts of men of good-will. They joyfully join this chorus of singers, blending their voices in the “Song of Praise” Testimony Period and saying: “I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the [nations], and sing praises unto thy name.”—Ps. 57:9; 18:49.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Theocratic singers will continue to present a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> and the premium of eight booklets, for one dollar, as the 1948 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign enters its second month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow Up New Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Without doubt many new subscriptions will be obtained in January and much interest aroused. During February, then, all publishers should diligently follow up new subscriptions and start home </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">studies wherever possible. Call back on new subscribers with the latest issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> within two weeks after the subscription is obtained. Stir interest in the magazine, thus prompting a study of its contents. In order to stimulate interest the publisher himself must study and be familiar with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> and be prepared to make the discussion live, interesting and instructive. Do not call back with a negative attitude, but rather with a positive aim in mind: to establish a home </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After arranging the study, maintain the interest created, using the questions and Scripture texts cited. “Know” the contents, and encourage the student to prepare in advance. About a month after home </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The 1948 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook’s</span><span class="font3"> account of the spread of true worship in more than 90 countries refreshes, strengthens and stimulates the reader. Even though read individually, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> lends itself to appropriate service meeting discussion throughout 1948. It is recommended that at least once a month the service meeting include a pointed, extempore report covering the expanse of true ministry in another land. Rather than serving simply as a review, the report can be made to tie in with local company service. How does your field work compare with theirs? Are your problems in getting to meetings and into the field as great? Are you exerting the same effort, and putting as much trust in Jehovah, as they are? Compare these reports with those appearing in the preceding </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font3"> or weave in related </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> material. Make these talks informative and interesting, with adequate preparation, and service meeting assemblers will be edified and stimulated to march on, pushing true worship locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tower</span><span class="font3"> studies are started, and the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font3"> has been placed, be alert to introduce a study of this basic publication, with its needed fundamental truths. Do not, however, let interest in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> fade. And remember always the final objective: association with true worshipers at company meetings and eventually in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reporting “Watchtower” Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As instructed in the January, 1947, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> where full details will be found, time spent on home </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and book studies is field service and should be reported. When both studies are conducted during one session, only one back-call will be counted, but if the studies are held on different days, two back-calls may be reported. Only one monthly Study Conductor’s Report will be submitted for both studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With such happy prospects of praise before us, who can refrain from joining in? Press forward, praisers of God, in the “Song of Praise” Testimony Period, in February, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sing</span><span class="font3"> unto Jehovah among the nations.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Joyous Assemblers Acclaim Christ Jesus as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Signal</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Upward of 20,000 publishers are still talking about it, at their meetings, in their homes, and with persons of good-will. And they will continue to do so, for the “Song of Praise” Assembly, held at Philadelphia, Pa., November 21-23, had far surpassed all expectations. Never, acclaimed many, had Jehovah showered down so milch in three short days. In a small way this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font3">will attempt to recapture a few of the assembly’s high lights, especially for the benefit of our brethren unable to be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Singing praise to Jehovah: that was the theme struck by the chairman in his address of welcome. Bearing thereon were other discourses of the afternoon, including the revealing and moving presentation, “Field Service for 1947 and 1948.” ‘It is the spirit of the Lord,’ declared the speaker, ‘that has effected the 1947 increase, and that same spirit will operate for 1948 expansion as we obediently do our part in the field.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Knorr’s first talk, “Gaining Entrance into Permanent Dwellings,” on Friday evening, made crystal clear the parable of the “unjust steward”. Gain entrance into permanent dwellings by making friends by use of the mammon of unrighteousness. And who is the “faithful steward” now? The heartening results of the relief program left no room for doubt. Close to one-third of a million dollars contributed for our needy brethren in Europe, and arrangements to send more used clothing under way! And how Jehovah had favored his steward in 1947, even with a new peak of 207,552 publishers in the field! The release of the 1948 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font3">and the beautiful Calendar came as a satisfying climax for the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On Saturday morning 321 symbolized their consecration; the afternoon was devoted to four encouraging discourses on endurance, pioneering, reporting and true worship; and in the evening the Society’s president addressed an attentive audience on “The Signal for the Peoples”. Not a standard, flag or banner; the “Signal” is earth’s new King, Christ Jesus. “Lift up the Signal! Behold it in all its glory and power!” A powerful resolution was then presented and unanimously adopted. Solidly back of the true Signal do we stand! We repudiate the makeshifts of men!</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Beginning February 1, 1948, the servants to the brethren will not be called upon to give the eight talks of the public meeting series. Instead, they will have a subject of their own, similar to that of the district servants. For the first six months this talk will be, “Paradise Earth—Man’s Permanent Home.” Special handbills will be printed, and companies to be visited by the servant to the brethren should order accordingly. Companies may extend their series to five or nine talks, whichever the case might be, including the talk of the servant to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This talk should be extensively advertised the week that the servant to the brethren visits your company. It should prove to be a stimulus to the public meeting work and a blessing to those who hear it. undergone much tribulation; so, appropriately, the Canadian Branch servant discoursed on “Singing Amid Tribulation”. An abundance of proof of our being true ministers was offered by the Society’s legal counsel, after which the Society’s vice-president again appeared on the platform, bringing to a close the Sunday morning session with a talk that stressed being “Organized for Theocratic Song”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">More than 28,000 packed out the convention halls Sunday at 3 p.m. to hear “Permanent Governor of All Nations”, the well-advertised high point of the assembly, stirringly delivered by Brother Knorr. To cap the delight of the “all-nations” audience, there came announcement of a new, unexpected Theocratic release, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But the end was not yet. After the convention servant carried us “behind the scenes”, Brother Knorr explained in heart-to-heart style “Why We Are So Different”. Sustained, appreciative applause greeted his announcement of new pioneer requirements, enabling many more to serve as full-time singers; a fitting conclusion for three days of praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then, with the strains of “The signal for all peoples raise” ringing in their ears and a song of praise on their lips, worshipers went their varied ways intent upon raising high Jehovah’s signal for all people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font3"> J) one that can be fitted into their practical Theocratic plans for the future. But perhaps the greatest opportunity of all lies with those who are housewives. Many of these will, by careful planning, be able to spend a morning or afternoon in the field and make pioneering their vocation. All can, no doubt, profit by discussing the matter with older pioneers, thus learning from their experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Goal Is 10 Percent!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ten percent of all publishers enrolled as pioneers! More than 7,000 in tlie United States and 20,000 in the world! Would not every reader of this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> bubble over with gladness to see that goal realized? What a tremendous forwarding of the true worship, as millions more hours were expended each year in proving Jehovah true, and Satan a liar! But instead of rejoicing solely at seeing such a hoped-for increase in the pioneer ranks, might it not be possible for you to have a personal share in expanding the full-time ministry? You thousands whose hearts are bound up in Kingdom service, will you not now accept the new arrangement as an instrument provided by Jehovah through the “faithful and wise servant”? Scores of letters have come into this office since the Philadelphia assembly, saying, “That’s the best news I’ve heard yet”; “I’m sure I can do it now.” And they are determined to try and try hard, confident that faith in God, coupled with this Scriptural arrangement for providing for personal needs, will enable them to keep on month after month, in the most blessed, joyful and practical occupation for any creature on this globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If, after prayerful consideration, you can possibly arrange to pioneer, we shall be happy to furnish an application, and work with you day after day in the service we all love so dearly—the ministry of the Kingdom. Why not be of that 10 percent?</span></p>

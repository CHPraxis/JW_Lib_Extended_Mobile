<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Make Final Month of 1948 Service Year the Best</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Ministers of religion point to their garb, their titles and their certificates of ordination as proof that they are God’s ministers. But, far from serving God and doing his pleasure, they serve and please only themselves and their commercial and political allies. And instead of blessing the Lord, they heap reproach upon his name by teaching the doctrines of devils. Such are not ordained of God. The ones He ordains, that is, places in position of service, are those who have acquainted themselves with his Word and purposes, consecrated themselves to him and received his holy spirit. All such give full proof of their ministry by obeying his command, found at Psalm 103:21, ‘‘Bless ye the Lobd, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Make August Outstanding Month</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the “Gon’s Ministers” Testimony Period we will bless Jehovah and do his pleasure by going from house to house with the bound book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand” </span><span class="font2">and the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations,</span><span class="font2"> placed together on a contribution of 35c. Special efforts should be made to leave a booklet in every home, for the message it contains is timely and important. Remember the quota: 50 booklets for each company publisher and 200 for each pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In calling back on literature ob-tainers be sure to take along question booklets, as an aid in establishing book studies. In fact, it would be well to take question booklets with us when going from house to house so that we can approach the subject of a study to those who may have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">August, a vacation month, brings with it added opportunities of service for many. Vacation pioneers, of course, will be devoting more time to the service. But other ministers also, old and young, who may have vacations, are encouraged, to take advantage of the extra time that vacation puts at their disposal by increasing their hours in the field during the month. Let all put forth special efforts to round out the service year by making this last month the best yet. A good final month will go far toward achieving our quotas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Recounting Our Blessings</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The final month of the service year is also an appropriate time to recount the blessings of the Lord. During the past service year we have had a new world-wide peak of more than 233,000 publishers and three consecutive peaks in this country. We have thus far averaged 60 percent of our quota of company publishers and have progressed steadily toward the 10-percent goal for pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So that all servants of the Lord may have a proper appreciation of these blessings and be stimulated to greater activity during the coming year, it would be well for each company or unit to devote one service meeting during August to the consideration of the service activity of the Lord’s people during the past year, the Lord’s blessing upon it, both locally and nation-wide, and the opportunities for improvement during the coming year. In the first part of the program an analysis can be made of the increase in publishers world-wide, in this country and then for the local company. Outstanding events in the service year, the circuit and district assemblies, the Memorial, the public meeting campaign, etc., should be highlighted. Interesting experiences might be given, those had by local brethren at home or at the assemblies, and/or those appearing in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> magazines. This should be followed by a consideration of “Making the Coming Year Better”. This can be accomplished by a careful analysis of any weaknesses of the company, especially as apparent from the chart, the prospects for increase as indicated by the Memorial attendance, and suggestions given for improvements, such as the need of personal organization, of regularity in the field, and of engaging in all features of the service. The pioneer quota of 10 percent of the total number of publishers should also be stressed. With proper planning and adequate advance preparation, this can be a most helpful and interesting service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Outdoor Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">August should also see all-out activity in the public meeting campaign. Reports coming in Indicate that public meetings held in the open are almost alwavs better attended than those held inside. With the recent ruling of the Supreme Court declaring all bans of the outdoor use of sound equipment illegal, the door for this feature of the work is opened wide. And let us make not only good use of it, but also wise use of it, making sure that our message is always presented in a dignified and courteous manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are God’s ministers. It is an honor and a joy to bless him and do his pleasure. Let all ministers, therefore, old and young, male and female, show their appreciation of this great privilege by zealously singing his praises and telling the good news of the Kingdom throughout the month of August.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">—Papiamento (Symbol: joPA)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The year 1949 looms before us with glorious prospects of Theocratic advancement. It seems well to rearrange and gear the organization of the work to provide adequately for these prospects. The Lord’s ministers have learned much during the past year, and this should contribute greatly to the effectiveness of the work during 1949.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Beginning August 23, 1948, the Society is reorganizing the circuit and district setup throughout the United States so that practically all circuits will contain 24 companies. This will eliminate a number of circuits and increase the number of companies in almost all the others. The districts will also be altered to conform to this arrangement, and will, as in the past, be composed of sufficient circuits to provide for 24 circuit assemblies every six months. This does not mean that there will necessarily be 24 circuits in each district. Where the circuits are large and a burden is placed on many brethren in endeavoring to reach one point in the circuit for an assembly, the circuits have been divided into two areas and provisions made to have a circuit assembly in each area every six months. In circuits where this will apply the circuit servant will be advised of which companies are in area “A” and which in area “B”. To the extent possible and practicable, the district servant will be routed so as to allow for at least two or three weeks between the time he serves area “A” and that of serving area “B” in any one circuit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Commencing August 23 a new district will be established which will be known as district #7. This district will be composed of the 12 colored circuits in the South. Because of the size of these circuits and the time, Inconvenience and expense involved, the Society is dividing all of them into areas “A” and “B”, as noted above. The district servant will go over this territory once serving area “A” in each circuit, and a second time serving area “B”. A graduate of the eleventh class of Gilead is being assigned as district servant for district #7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A complete Spanish circuit is also being formed comprising those Span-</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Stock Inventory and Service Reports</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Two “Stock Inventory” forms are being sent to each company and pioneer with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> An actualcount inventory of stock on hand should be taken by each pioneer and each company and recorded accurately and completely on these forms in duplicate. The original should be sent to the Society’s office not later than September 6, and the duplicate retained by the company or pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each company and pioneer should complete August’s field service report on August 31 and make a special effort to have it in the mail not later than September 4, since August concludes the service year. ish companies in Texas and vicinity. This will be known as circuit S-10. A Spanish-speaking brother will be assigned as circuit servant for that area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Readjustment of Personnel</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The above readjustment and the fact that many of the brethren now serving as circuit servants are leaving for their foreign assignments and many others are going to Gilead for the next class make it necessary to inaugurate a complete rearrangement of the circuit servants. Therefore, the Society is notifying all companies who their new circuit servant will be and to what circuit they are assigned. The circuit servants will also be advised fully as to their assignments. The Society is requesting all circuit servants to send their permanent addresses in the new circuits to the Society’s office at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, as soon after August 23 as possible. Do this even though it may be the same as heretofore. They are also requested to advise us of the two cities they recommend for 1949 circuit assemblies. It is urgent that they work on this immediately. All company servants are requested to co-operate thoroughly with the circuit servant in obtaining and dispatching this information. All circuit assemblies will be canceled for the month of September. All of the brethren who plan to attend the district assembly are asked to attend the one to which they were assigned under the 1948 district arrangement.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>September to Be a Month of Profitable Endurance</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">For a Christian to faithfully endure the hardships of the ministry means life everlasting. Wrapped up in that endurance is not only his own salvation but the means for others to gain salvation. Fittingly the apostle Paul wrote the young minister Timothy, “Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.”—1 Tim. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">4:</span><span class="font2">16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Following the example of the faithful Endurer, Christ Jesus, Christians of today know they have more to work for than their own salvation. They must preach. They must demonstrate unselfish love for their neighbor by offering to him the way to life through Christ Jesus. That this is being done throughout the earth today on a large scale is attested to by the fruitful results of Jehovah’s witnesses’ activities during the past service year. It has been a year of endurance, yes, just as the coming years will be before Armageddon, but Jehovah’s servants know that by enduring until the end their faithful service will pile up a ‘heap of witness’ to the Most High God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">September begins another service year of endurance for the Lord’s servants, but they do not look to it with a negative attitude. They are ever more determined to do the great work of preaching that the Lord has purposed to be done. They</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Instructions for Pioneers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">It is indeed gratifying to see an ever-increasing number of pioneers serving as God’s ministers full-time. The Society desires to serve each pioneer with the greatest passible efficiency, taking care of subscriptions, remittances, etc., as soon as possible upon receipt. This can be done, however, only if all pioneers carefully follow instructions. Some have overlooked the following points:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. When sending in subscriptions </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">always</span><span class="font2"> list them on a Subscription Record Sheet, whether you are sending many or only one.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. Take care to send the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">correct </span><span class="font2">remittance to cover the cost of the subscriptions. Pioneer subscription rates are: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Renewal</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions for 1 year $1.00, and for six months 50c; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions as shown in Cost List. No separate remittance form is needed when sending only subscriptions accompanied by the exact remittance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. If you desire to send an extra amount to be applied to your account, then properly fill out and enclose a remittance form showing the right amount for subscriptions and the amount to be applied to your account. When too much or too little is sent for subscriptions and this incorrect amount is shown on the Subscription Record Sheet, credit memos or invoices must be made out at the office here, which operation is not necessary if the above instructions are follow’ed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. Subscriptions are charged only when your account has sufficient credit balance to cover.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5. Remittances with an order or to be applied to magazine or book accounts should </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">always</span><span class="font2"> be sent with the new remittance form.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Careful adherence to the above and occasional reviewing of previous instructions covering these matters will improve our service to you and hence our combined service to persons of good-will. know the Kingdom message must be preached so that men of good-will may know the way to life, and they understand the words of Paul, “How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer of Three Bound Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Starting the new service year with a song of united praise, to help us in our work of preaching we have as instruments three of the latest bound books with the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations. </span><span class="font2">These books, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”, “The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;, </span><span class="font2">will be offered in combination on a contribution of $1.00. With their wide variety of subject material they offer much information to draw from in teaching others how to gain salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While portions of your territory may already have been worked with these publications, it will be found that many interested persons do not have the literature and will gladly accept it upon presentation. Cover the territory thoroughly, be diligent and enthusiastic in offering the books, and good results will be forthcoming. If it is found that some already have the recent literature, rather than stressing the placement of more books, seek to stimulate the householder’s interest in the publications he already possesses. Answer his questions and offer to return at his convenience to help him further in his study of the Bible. Demonstrate your desire for all of good-will to gain salvation as much as you desire it for yourself, by taking advantage of every opportunity to start book studies. Carry question booklets with you so as to be prepared to share with them the precious truths that lead to life. A copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations</span><span class="font2"> should be left with everyone who will read it, whether the person already has the other publications or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By our works of preaching we are making our endurance a profitable endurance; an endurance that benefits men of good-will and one that guarantees our salvation in the New World.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Enrollment Advances</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Faith Upholds Those in Ranks</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The month of June has been outstanding from the standpoint of the pioneer ministry. New pioneers have steadily been accepting the opportunity to advance in Theocratic service, with the result that when June ended there was a total of 5,581 pioneers enrolled, well over two thousand more than there were last December when the old requirements were replaced. Furthermore, during June, 402 vacation pioneers came on the list, bringing their total number for this year to 620, an all-time peak of vacation pioneers! But June brings further good news concerning pioneers. The previous peak for total pioneer enrollments during any one month was in June, 1945, when 581 entered the ranks. June 1946 approached that number with 512; but June 1948 eclipsed both with 709 pioneers going on the list, the largest number for any one month that we have ever had in the United States! Truly the pioneer ministry is expanding, strong evidence of Jehovah’s favor on full-time service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“Fulfill thy ministry.” This is the obligation resting upon all God’s consecrated ministers. And they are interested in continuously improving that ministry and becoming more efficient Kingdom publishers. A Godgiven provision for such improvement is the Theocratic ministry school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Playing an important part in the conduct of the school is the school servant, whose responsibility it is to see that the school is conducted according to instructions and that the most benefit possible is derived therefrom. And not only the school servant, but also the minister who attends the school, must share in making it interesting. The first requisite to an interesting and instructive school is thorough preparation by all. Advance preparation will make for a more lively oral review, with both brothers and sisters participating. Variety can be obtained by assigning instruction talks to various competent brothers enrolled in the school. The judicious assignment of subjects to the brethren giving student talks will also aid in making the school more helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In presenting counsel, school servants, be kind, sympathetic. Never be harsh or overly critical. Also avoid being frivolous. Rather, with meekness and understanding offer </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">constructive</span><span class="font2"> criticism in a considerate, friendly manner. Give an encouraging word. In every speaker there are some good points on which you can make favorable </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">comment. Do so. </span><span class="font2">Display genuine interest in all students and publishers in the company; be alert to render assistance to all who need it in all features of the Kingdom ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">One feature of the school which has more than proved its worth to the minister is the written review. It is truly designed to improve knowledge of the Bible for use in ministerial service. The written reviews are not competitive, but are for each minister's individual edification. To get the most out of the review, one must put much into it,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaching the Goal</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When the Society set the goal of 10 percent of the publishers in the pioneer service, our goal became 7,000 pioneers. Is there any possibility for us to reach that goal, even in 1948? The above figures answer for themselves. With 5,581 enrolled, only 1,500 new pioneers would bring us to our goal of 7,000 pioneers. It must be remembered, however, that many of the 5,581 are vacation pioneers. Therefore, in addition to the 1,500 new pioneers, the places of those who will be returning to school in the fall must be filled by others who can continue during the fall and winter months. But the challenge is there, as is the strong possibility that we can have 7,000 pioneers in 1948. What a privilege to be one of them and have a share in attaining to the goal!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Faith Upholds the Pioneer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Contributing to the reaching of our goal of 10 percent will be the continued zeal of those already enrolled; and those now entering as which means study. Studying for the written review need not be a burdensome task, but rather an enjoyable privilege. In addition to individual research, which can be most absorbing, family or other groups can review the lessons under consideration together. Do not fear the review because of the grade you might receive. That is only an incidental matter. All answers and grades are confidential. Of more importance is making every effort to make as much of this valuable information your own as possible. Keep your review papers so that you can refer to them from time to time. This will aid you even further in retaining the knowledge gained through the review.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In grading papers the school servant should use wisdom and good judgment. Thoroughly understand the questions and answers. When a student answers a question properly in his own words he should receive full credit. Also give partial credit to partially correct answers, indicating which part is correct. If there is doubt, give to the student the benefit of the doubt. By doing this, the school servant can do much to keep interest in the reviews alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Time may be taken in service meetings from time to time to stimulate interest in the school and the written reviews. Information that is especially valuable in the field ministry can be pointed out, showing the importance of participating in the review so as to retain this essential knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our ministry school and the written review are an integral part of our ministerial training. “Fulfill thy ministry” by wisely making full use of this provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">pioneers have the same prospects of many years of joyful full-time service. To continue, however, requires endurance and determination; to be a pioneer is a test of faith. There will be many trials as the fiery darts of the adversary seek out the full-time servant. But why should we expect otherwise? The same has been true down through the centuries and is no less to be expected now at the end of this old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nor will the fact that pioneers may now engage part-time in secular work lessen the need for faith to turn back those darts of the enemy. The first few months will usually be the most difficult, until one’s life becomes adjusted to the new routine. Though many blessings will come from stepping out into the pioneer work, it is not in one month or two or three that one tastes of all the blessings that Jehovah has in store for his full-time servants. Only faith makes continued pioneer service possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Are you now a pioneer or are you considering that forward step? In either case, go ahead in the strength of the Lord and refuse to give up easily. Have faith in God and give the pioneer service a fair trial. Combine with faith determination; determination to endure to salvation in the pioneer ranks and determination not to be ‘swallowed up in the sea’ by allowing secular work to consume any more time than absolutely essential. Be ever mindful of the yearly quota of 1,400 hours and make wise use of favorable weather, so that the end of the year will not find you unable to attain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Progress in the first six months gives every reason to believe that 1948 will be an outstanding year for pioneer enrollment as God’s ministers, advancing in faith, grasp the opportunities which He provides for them.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Aid Others to Praise Jehovah</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Has the praising of the political, commercial and religious rulers of this world ever led the people to peace and prosperity? Have such worldly leaders ever done for their fellow creatures anything deserving of praise? Down through the corridors of time comes the thundering answer, No! What folly, then, to continue to laud and praise imperfect, weak and selfish rulers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But there is one who is worthy of the unstinted praise of all creatures ; one to whom all persons are indebted for their very existence; one who in times past has wrought marvelous acts of deliverance in behalf of those that praised him; and the only one able to deliver human creatures at the coming battle of Armageddon. That one, the praise of whom guarantees deliverance and salvation, is Jehovah, even as the psalmist says: “I will call upon the Loud, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.”—Ps. 18: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The command to praise Jehovah is to all his creatures; none are exempt. In fact, the only reason for living is to praise him. Such praise guarantees salvation regardless of how many or how great our enemies may be. And as the psalmist called on all musical instruments as well as all having breath to praise Jehovah, so his servants at the present time must use every legitimate means to do the same: the printed as well as the spoken word; from house to house, on the streets, in the homes and at public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Instruments for Praise</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The two instruments of praise that Jehovah’s servants will feature during July are the bound book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font1"> and the new 32-page booklet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations,</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of thirty-five cents. Highlighting as they do Jehovah’s King and kingdom as his means for salvation, they make an ideal combination. How clearly the Kingdom theme runs throughout the Scriptures, and yet how few appreciate that all-important fact I But they can, with help such as the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;.</span><span class="font1"> And as religion goes all-out in support of the human substitute, most timely is the message showing that the schemes of men will fail and that only Jehovah’s Governor will be a permanent ruler. Endeavor, therefore, to leave a copy of the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations </span><span class="font1">in every home where they will promise to read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With summer weather comes the opportunity to bring the message to those living in the rurals. However, to make rural activity really effective it must be properly organized. The everlasting destiny of those people is involved, and therefore we owe it to them to carry on our work most efficiently so as to reach as many as possible. For instance, where houses are stretched out along the highway, one publisher after the other can be dropped off along the way, the driver witnessing to the last house and then returning to pick up his entire group. In this way comparatively little time will be lost in waiting for others. Efficiency can be improved, too, if arrangements are made to call back on interested persons, rather than try to tell them everything on the first call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Guaranteeing Salvation for Others</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our concern is not that we alone may gain salvation, but that others also may obtain it. For our praise to guarantee it for others as well as ourselves we must make back-calls and conduct book studies. For the ears of those of good-will to really hear requires understanding and appreciation; and that means giving them individual and personal help. As one recently wrote to the Society: “Please send someone here to teach us. It is so hard to understand the Bible alone. We need lots of explanation. We would not miss </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> for anything but we need someone to help us. You told us one time that you would endeavor to send someone, and that was a year ago.” (What an opportunity for some pioneer!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Having helped the good-will to come to an understanding of the truth, let us go further by helping them to also engage in salvationguaranteeing praise. Encourage them to come along with you in the street work and on back-calls and then the house-to-house work. You will find this to be the most stimulating part of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the summer months many companies will be able to arrange for evening witnessing; perhaps sometimes with the booklet alone, but also with the regular offer. More people are at home on weekday evenings than at any other time of the day or week; so let us make good use of this opportunity to praise Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Summer will also see the expansion of the public meeting campaign to the rurals and out-of-doors. If a hall, park or bandstand is not available, an empty lot or a front lawn can be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So during July let all brethren guarantee salvation for themselves and aid others to do so by praising Jehovah with their voices and with every instrument at their disposal.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>To Our Vacation Pioneers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Have you ever paused to consider what a Theocratically important forward step you have taken in becoming a vacation pioneer? What a great privilege it is to be in the ranks of the full-time servants of Jehovah God, even though for only a few months! As full-time proclaimers of Jehovah’s permanent Theocratic government you daily show forth to your “neighbors” your true position as a minister of the Most High God, and that at a tender age. As with Samuel and Jeremiah, youthful fulltime ministers of old, Jehovah’s holy spirit will daily perfect praise out of your mouths. Age matters not with the Lord, and neither will men of good-will “despise thy youth” so long as you perform your ministry in the Christlike manner set forth in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You “young men and maidens” who have selected vacation pioneering as your summer occupation have exercised commendable wisdom. Wise is your course of separateness from a corrupt world of adult and juvenile delinquency. Rather than “running wild”, squandering precious time in idle pleasures, you have chosen a course of conduct that is “different”, one wherein your time and energy are properly expended in serving your Maker. Through praising as vacation pioneer you are receiving the best possible training for advancing in your life work as an ambassador of Jehovah and his kingdom. And truly, vacation-pioneer activity affords youthful ministers a splendid opportunity to ‘remember their Creator in the days of their youth’, extending to them the ambassador’s responsibility of teaching men of good-will. Cherish that obligation and inestimable privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Meeting the Requirements</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Measuring up to the Theocratic requirements of the vacation pioneer calls for certain requisites on the part of the minister. He must first place full faith in Jehovah’s promises and purposes, and display implicit trust in the Lord as the Provider of the needs of his servants. Next, the Theocratic ambassador should possess a keen appreciation of his service to Jehovah and of the responsibilities laid upon him by merit of his high office of minister. With a keen desire to discharge these Theocratic duties properly, the servant of Jehovah will work with efficiency and look well to personal organization of his resources. He will budget his time prudently and diligently endeavor to meet the requirements of the pioneer by resourcefully devoting a maximum amount of time to Kingdom field ministry and study and a minimum amount of time to other activity. Further, the appreciative, efficient minister will be regular, consistent. He will hasten to take an exemplary lead in all features of the Kingdom service, always alert to aid others in improving their ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Indeed, in vacation-pioneer service the avenues of Theocratic advancement are many, holding forth glorious future prospects. Vacation</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Pioneers’ Reporting Important</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Due to a lack of appreciation of the Society’s need for accurate and trustworthy reports, it is necessary that we write to upward of a hundred pioneers each month either requesting their report or questioning some obvious inconsistency regarding it. To save this needless expenditure of time, pioneers are requested to please note and conform to the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. Be sure that you put your name on the card on the line indicated therefor. Do not leave this line blank; do not put name of city instead of your own name; do not add street address to your name. Note state in space provided. Write name legibly (printed or typewritten is preferred).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. Be sure you affix stamp; otherwise the Society is required to pay two cents each time you forget.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3. Reporting studies: The number of studies is determined by the number of different places or homes at which you conduct studies two or more times a month. Each time a study is conducted it is also a back-call ; therefore the number of back-calls you can report in any one month must be at least twice the number of book studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">4. Reporting public meetings: Leave this space blank unless you yourself sponsored the public meetings. Only the one sponsoring the public meeting should report it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">5. From time to time check your report letter, which contains more detailed instructions on this important matter of reporting.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">pioneering might well be the turning point in your life, the start of a life career of regular pioneer service. Many general and special pioneers now enjoying the blessings of regular full-time activity found their start in the vacation service. By faithfully “staying on the job” you may entertain the possibility of foreign service and other added privileges, if that be the Lord’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But most important of all, you brethren who have enrolled as vacation pioneers can be confident of the Lord’s approval and may look for his abundant blessing as you utilize your faculties in a service that leads you in the path of life in the New World.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Cod’s Ministers” Testimony Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ministers Bless Jehovah by Doing His Pleasure</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand” Proclaimed Earth-wide</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">During August</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Bless ye the Lobd, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.” (Ps. 103:21) With their lips religious ministers “bless God”, but by their actions they confess publicly that they are not God’s ministers. Their unscriptural teachings and mixing up with corrupt politics of this world brand them as “false apostles” who defy the command and “pleasure” of God plainly written in his Word. Seminary education and man-made certificates mean nothing in the ordination of God’s ministers. It is God who ordains, and the proof is undeniable that God’s ordination through Christ and his spirit rests solidly upon Jehovah’s witnesses, both the remnant and the “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Doing God’s Pleasure In Kingdom Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">God’s true ministers render more than mere lip-service. They </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font1"> his pleasure, using all their faculties, lips, tongue, mind, heart, hands, feet, eyes and ears to the glory of the Lord and his Son. They do his pleasure by willingly and joyfully accepting the responsibility to go forth into the field of public praise, either in individual territory or with a group. They do his pleasure by confessing with their tongues to Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and all others, from house to house and on the streets, by public meetings and in other ways, that the Kingdom has come to crush out evil and reign forever in righteousness. And they minister good news by return calls upon interested hearers, who need help in coming to a clear grasp of the Scriptures. God’s ministers stick close to the method of ministry which Jehovah ordained for his Chief Minister 1,900 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Again and again God’s model minister, Christ Jesus, proclaimed: “The kingdom is at hand.” We follow his example, even to the very wording of the message preached. Ours, however, is an expanded min-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Remittances and Credit Memos</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As announced in the June </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> no credit memos will be issued after June 30, except for adjustments of accounts. Beginning July 1, 1948, use the new remittance form (S-52) for sending in all remittances to be applied to your book and magazine accounts. Some companies used the new remittance form for sending in their remittances for June. For these June remittances, credit memos </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font1"> be issued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Symbols denoting the manner In which remittances have been made to the Society will henceforth appear on the statement. Accounts servants may wish to clip the following designation of symbols from an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> and paste them in a convenient place for future reference.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">X Express money order istry. Jesus did not possess the printed Word; his territory, moreover, was limited. In this day, when the Kingdom is permanently fixed under Christ, the whole world has become the field for ministry. God’s pleasure is that “all nations” be informed of the Kingdom’s reign. Hence God’s modern-day ministers make full use of the advanced means of communication developed since Jesus’ day. They deliver oral testimony, yes. But they properly carry with them this month the illuminating Bible helps </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations,</span><span class="font1"> offered in combination, on a 35c contribution. Besides hearing good news from the lips of God’s ministers, thousands who seek God will be able to read, together with the Bible, more than 350 pages about the long-prayed-for Kingdom and its blessings. And into the hands of these and many more thousands will be placed the absorbing 32-page booklet which details proof of the present reign of God’s ordained Permanent Governor, and the near end of wickedness. Spread the message of Kingdom truth from one end of your territory to the other by offering the book and booklet to all you serve, and by getting news of the Permanent Governor into every home, if possible, where they will read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Opportunity for a United Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All consecrated witnesses of God are his ministers, whether they bear the designation company publisher, pioneer, special pioneer, or vacation pioneer. All serve God “day and night”, dedicating everything they possess to his service. With good reason, “Gon’s Ministebs” Testimony Period ought to show forth to the world a united ministration of freedom-giving truths to the people who sit as prisoners shackled to sin, sickness and death because of a false ministry by Satan’s servants. To all of God’s ministers, male and female, young and old, wonderful opportunities open up during August to “make full proof of thy ministry” in your home territory. Let the Kingdom light shine through you, to God’s praise and the blessing of the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ministry to Jehovah will never cease. But preaching of the Kingdom among “all nations” will end at Armageddon. Make the most of your opportunities to minister by Kingdom proclamation now, “publicly, and from house to house,” and guarantee for yourself and others an eternity of glorious service as God’s ministers in the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Vacation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In order that all those concerned may plan accordingly and order needed literature and supplies in advance, notice is now being given that the Bethel home, factory and office will be closed for vacation during the two-week period of August 7-22 inclusive. All pioneers and companies wanting literature for use during this time will please send their orders no later than July 12, in order to avoid a last-minute rush. With the exception of report cards and subscriptions, as little correspondence as possible should be sent to the Society during this period, in that no orders will be filled or correspondence answered from August 7 to August 22. Servants to the brethren will have their vacation during the same two weeks.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Consecration</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Means Joyful Service </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Individual Schedule to Include All Features</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah has ordained a work to be done in the earth today. This work is the preaching of the Kingdom message throughout the earth; and as his servants, Jehovah’s witnesses have consecrated themselves to do this work of preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In contrast with the people of the world who are regimented into doing the will of Satan, Jehovah’s servants are willing volunteers. To do the will of their Creator is a joy and a delight. They do not seek happiness in pleasures of this world, because they take God’s Word as truth when it says that such worldly pleasures are vanity and that the only real joy comes from serving Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The joy manifested by Jehovah’s witnesses is based upon their conviction that God’s word is true; that he will vindicate his name and fulfill his glorious promises of salvation to faithful men. This hope of salvation and the privilege of sharing in the vindication of his name gives them peace of mind which men of this world do not have. This hope is so strong that it impels them to tell it out to others so they too may have a chance to learn of the Kingdom and rejoice. Yes, even their faces beam with joy as they go from house to house and stand on the street corners to tell the people about that Kingdom of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Increasing Our Joy</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All Jehovah’s faithful servants have experienced and are experiencing this great joy of serving him. Are you perhaps for one reason or another missing some of these joys that could be yours? If this is true an examination should be made to find out the reason why. Is it due to a failure to appreciate Jehovah’s purposes as revealed in his Word and the great privilege of serving him? Then you should diligently study God’s Word and the instruments he has provided for our joy and strength. This, with regular attendance at meetings, will, no doubt, increase your joy of service. Is it due to a failure to engage in all features of the service? Then you should bestir yourself so that you not only go from house to house, and stand on the street, but also follow through by calling back and conducting book studies, for that is really the most joyful part of the service. Is it due to a failure to grasp all of your privileges? No one can have the joy of the Lord if he has the opportunity to engage in the full-time service and does not avail himself of it. You should venture forth in full faith, and you will find your joy increasing. As one pioneer wrote on the bottom of his first pioneer report card, “A month filled with joy and happiness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since returning from the district assemblies being held throughout the continent, many have written in that they are convinced by the practical instructions given that they must become more efficient ministers and advance in his service. Pioneering, to them, is the logical step to take, and they rejoice to expand into the pioneer ranks and into greater service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not that pioneer service is without trials and problems. In fact, all service rendered to Jehovah brings with it reproach and suffering from the hands of Satan and his demoncontrolled men. But like our faithful Exemplar, Christ Jesus, we will</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Catalogue</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An attractive 16-page self-covered catalogue has recently been completed which gives the description and prices of the most recent publications of the Society. It should prove to be a helpful addition to the equipment of the Theocratic minister. Catalogues can be ordered now at the rate of 50c for 100 copies. They may be placed with publishers at jc a copy. Companies and pioneers may order less than 100 copies, when shipped with other literature, at the rate of Jc per copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The material in the catalogue is very suitable to further acquaint interested persons with the work and publications of the Society. It contains a brief introductory note which explains the purpose of the Society, a description of the three Scripture editions which the Society publishes, and explanation of the features of both </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> as well as sets forth the contents of the latest books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That the catalogue may play its full part in advancing knowledge concerning the Kingdom, all company publishers and pioneers are urged to carry it regularly in field service, leaving a copy with those who show definite or unusual interest, and with back-call and bookstudy persons. The concise and dignified manner in which the catalogue presents the publications makes it suitable for use with businessmen or those persons contacted in secular work who show interest but who cannot be witnessed to because of time limitations. A few copies of the catalogue can be taken along in the street work, too, to answer inquiries about our work and publications which we can supply. The various ways in which the catalogue can be used, and the points on the different publications which it sets forth, could profitably be considered on the service meeting program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Company servants, and pioneers who cannot obtain supplies through a company organization, may order immediately, according to their estimated needs. Wherever possible, orders should accompany 100-pound shipments.</span></p>

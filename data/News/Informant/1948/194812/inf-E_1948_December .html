<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Individual Expansion Aids Toward New Publisher Peaks</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Almighty God long ago foreknew the conditions that would exist on the earth in our day. He knew that there would be a distressing famine in Christendom, the modern counterpart of ancient Jerusalem, which would make it difficult for men to fill their minds with sufficient spiritual truth to satisfy their needs. And he knew what the remedy would be. For our comfort and direction he portrayed to his prophet Ezekiel how the truth would reach the minds of the people through a work in which we, his servants, could participate; and, as a warning to Christendom, her downfall was at the same time foretold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Through Ezekiel we learn that just before issuing the command that unfaithful Christendom be destroyed by God’s heavenly army, God makes provision to spare goodwill persons from her fate. This is to be accomplished by a modern ‘‘man with a writer’s Inkhorn” going through the antltyplcal city, marking the foreheads of those who sigh and cry by filling their minds with Kingdom truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We today joyfully accept our responsibility as set forth in the prophetic command given to the man with the writer’s inkhorn: “Go through the midst of the city . . . and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done.”—Ezek. 9:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Interest to Be Aided</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To aid us in more efficiently ‘setting the mark’ during this “Setting the Mabk” Testimony Period, we shall have as part of our equipment the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font2"> and one of the latest booklets, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People.</span><span class="font2"> Combine these with determination and words fitly spoken from God’s word of truth, and an effective instrument for ‘setting the mark’ has been created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not only will we be diligent in this service ourselves, but a special effort will be made in December to aid those who have recently ‘received the mark’ to pass it along to others. In our territories are many persons with whom back-calls and book studies are being conducted who would participate with us in the service if assisted and encouraged to do so. Explain the purpose of Kingdom service and why it is necessary for all who love the Lord and his kingdom to share in the marking work. Tact and discretion should be used at all times, of course; but sincere and persistent aid of these newly interested ones on the part of all publishers can result in achieving our goal for</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">December, another new peak of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Individual Expansion Necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To reach a new publisher peak will require the diligent co-operation of circuit servants, servants in the companies, book study conductors and, most important, the individual publisher. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Individual expansion </span><span class="font2">—yes, here is where expansion really starts. Expansion comes by each publisher’s Individually expanding his service privileges. The increased services of all these Individual publishers added together is what makes our hearts glad when we see the new peak published in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> Climaxing this year's activity, then, Jehovah’s servants will conscientiously say, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;I</span><span class="font2"> will sing praises unto thee among the nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let each of us, therefore, use these effective instruments that Jehovah has provided for our ‘marking’ work to expand our service privileges in our own territories. Throughout the year many, many books, booklets and magazines have been placed with the people. Among those who obtained these are many persons of good-will who would be glad to receive the “mark” and serve Jehovah. Back-calls made upon them and book studies conducted in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font2"> will be the effective means to educate them for life eternal. However, education should not stop at the home Bible study. Invite these truth-seekers to the Kingdom Hall to partake of the spiritual food being dispensed there. This will include the service meeting too, for here they learn the Importance of service and how to ‘set the mark’ on others. Interesting service meetings, planned well by conscientious servants, will do much to aid the new interest to appreciate the Theocratic arrangement Let December’s “Setting the Mark” service meeting serve as a model in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">December presents the problem of colder or perhaps disagreeable weather, but this will not cause faithful educators to slow up. Rather, it will be considered as just another challenge to meet and overcome as we push ahead in the great expansion campaign. Arrangements can be made to capitalize on nice days and stress back-calls and book studies when other activity Is not so practical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Taking advantage, then, of all instruments that the Lord has given us for the pre-Armageddon ‘marking’ work, we will hasten to complete it before destruction of ‘unmarked’ ones begins. In full harmony with Jehovah’s Theocratic organization, will join the evergrowing number of ministers who individually during December once more say, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;I</span><span class="font2"> will sing praises unto thee among the nations.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Will Sing Praises unto Jehovah!’</span></p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">This You Have Done “More and More’&quot;, in October</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>New Peak of 82,217 Publishers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Again we have good news for all expansion-minded ministers; ministers who not only are glad to see the Increase of the true worship in the earth, but who delight to have a vital part therein themselves. And what is that good news? This: In the second month of our new service year we not only have met our quota, but have exceeded it by nearly two thousand publishers! Yes, in this land, 82,217 ministers during the month of October took to heart the year’s text, “I will sing praises unto thee among the nations,” sang praises, and then reported that service. Six times since last January we have had a peak In number of publishers; this last one exceeding our previous all-time high by more than 3,000, and last year’s peak by more than 8,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We rejoice to be, by Jehovah’s grace, well on the way to realizing our quota tor the year, which is an average of 80,239 publishers monthly. And though we got off to a rather weak start in September, no doubt largely because some brethren neglected to report, if we can maintain October’s number of publishers for the next two months we shall have our ten-percent Increase in average</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">New Circuit and District Servant Talks</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Circuit Assembly Program to Be Changed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">As each circuit assembly comes to a close, those who attend return to their home territory with thankful hearts. They have been strengthened for further service and look forward expectantly to the coming of similar blessings in the future. The visits of the circuit servants to the local companies perform a similar service. It is to be expected, therefore, that all publishers look with interest to the progress of this helpful work in their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A new talk will be given by both the circuit servant and the district servant beginning January 1, 1949. The one for the circuit servant will be entitled “From Scarcity to Plenty”. This announcement will make it possible for the proper handbills to be ordered in time for the next visit of the circuit servant to your company after this date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The district servant’s talk for the next series of assemblies will be “The Government of Peace”. At the same time, January 1, 1949, some changes will be made in the circuit assembly program. These changes are directed toward giving local brethren a greater share in the program as well as to add variety and make the best possible use of the time that is set aside for the assemfor the first four months. Can we do it? With Jehovah’s help, we can!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">True, for the majority of us, bad weather lies ahead. But, has there ever been a full month with weather so bad that a publisher could not Invite one person to a public meeting and then attend it himself? when a publisher could not make one back-call or conduct a single book study in thirty days, and then report it? Of course not! So, while inclement weather may Interfere with street and house-to-house activity to some extent, it need not eliminate them entirely: and certainly not our back-call and book-study ministry. There Is every reason, then, for keeping throughout the winter the number of publishers that have reported for October. In fact, right now we are aiming for yet another peak in December. Just two years ago December was the best month of the calendar year, showing that it can be done. So, regardless of the weather, let each one with added determination take to heart the text, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;I</span><span class="font2"> will sing praises unto thee among the nations,” sing out Jehovah’s praises during this concluding month of the year, and report without fall. Then sing praises unto Jehovah more and more, thereby also helping others to sing, and Jehovah will add the increase!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">bly of the circuit. Brethren selected to have a part on the program will be so notified by the circuit servant, who will instruct them on the details of their assignment Those thus privileged will prepare diligently, as have the brethren called upon to take part on the program in the past, so that their presentations will prove edifying to those assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among the changes is the addition of three brief but valuable discourses to be given Saturday afternoon. All should put forth every effort to attend these and then share in the advertising work Immediately thereafter. Under the new program arrangement, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> lesson for that week will be covered by a 80-minute discussion from the platform instead of the question and answer method regularly used in the companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The blessings of the circuit assembly arrangement In the past have proved the value of these gatherings of the Lord’s people. Continued and enthusiastic support by all will insure these benefits in the future. Attend the circuit assembly in your circuit and also secure for yourself the benefits of the next visit of the circuit servant by full participation in the company’s activity during the week of his visit.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Showing Belief for Final Salvation” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare New for Eleventh Annual Subscription Campaign</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Two Subscriptions and Bound Book to Be Offered</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">How foolish the course of this world! A striving for selfish gain, for that which brings neither peace of mind nor joy of heart; a way that seemeth right, but the ends of which are the ways of death. As Jesus so well said: “For what shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?” Those who are wise desire to be saved from this world and its present unsatisfactory conditions of insecurity, disease and death; from its wickedness and from its oppressive rule, and therefore they look unto Jehovah and his New World of righteousness for salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To realize salvation at Jehovah’s hands, however, his needy creatures not only must profess belief in him as the only true God and in Christ Jesus as his provision for salvation, but must </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">show</span><span class="font2"> that belief by a consistent course of action, and they must continue therein until final salvation is realized. That is why the apostle Paul wrote the youthful minister Timothy: “For to this end we </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">labor</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">strive,</span><span class="font2"> because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.” —1 Tim. 4:10, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Foremost among the Society’s publications to aid the lovers of righteousness to gain salvation in God’s appointed way is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine. For this reason the Society has again arranged for a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription campaign, the eleventh, beginning January 1, 1949, and continuing for four months. The offer will consist of a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> and a premium of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> or any other bound book that you may have in stock, together with a booklet, for a contribution of two dollars. Where the two subscriptions cannot be obtained, stress should be placed on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoioer</span><span class="font2"> subscription. If unsuccessful in that, then seek to place a bound book, and if that fails, then by all means endeavor to leave a booklet with them. (Where both subscriptions are obtained and a premium of a bound book and booklet is given, 80c per subscription will be sent to the Society. Where only one subscription is obtained, for either magazine, a booklet but no bound book will be given, and 90c will be forwarded to the Society. Pioneers will send the same remittance as usual for each subscription obtained.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Presenting the Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One main field for obtaining subscriptions is, of course, the house-to-house activity. Therefore, after your brief introduction present to each householder </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font2"> the two-magazine offer. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> are ideal companions and each provides in its own unique way for the needs of men of goodwill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We know that there is no magazine that can compare with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> in value and importance, and that we continually delight in its life-giving message. During the past year it has brought us able discussions of the ransom, immortality, the operation of the holy spirit, the religious dogma of the trinity”, how the Sacred Record was transmitted, the book of Jude, and many other subjects. All who read it benefited Immeasurably from its wholesome admonition on proper conduct, in such articles as “Hearing Ears”. Should not this magazine be in every home?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And can any magazine compare with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> for variety of interest, for alertness, for authentic coverage of important events, and, above all, for value in understanding the times in which we live and keeping </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">awake </span><span class="font2">to world conditions? Add to this a booklet and a beautiful bound book, such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font2"> which contains clear and concise explanations of more than twenty of the fundamental teachings of the Bible. Who could hesitate to present such an offer as this at every door?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Therefore make your presentation with enthusiasm and conviction. You do have something very good to present. Single out interesting facts and Important truths in this article or that one to high-light your presentation. That, of course, means first getting acquainted with the magazines yourself. Finally, remember Theocratic tactfulness. Be all things to all men, using persuasive speech to show them the way to salvation. Go from house to house in the strength of the Lord, obey instructions and look to Him to bless your efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to engaging in the house-to-house activity let us give all our back-calls and book studies the opportunity to subscribe. Also point out to them their privilege of helping others, such as their relatives and friends, to benefit from reading our publications. Some may wish to give a subscription to a friend as a gift. Thus they too can ‘show belief for final salvation’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The public meeting closing announcements and handbill distribution or street magazine work will provide other opportunities to briefly bring the subscription offer to the attention of people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Proper Preparation Essential</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To get the subscription campaign off to a good start will require thorough advance preparation, both by the company organization and by the individual publishers. Company servants should see to it that everything is in order: that the advertising servant has ordered the necessary increase in distributors’ copies (as the Society now has ample paper to supply all the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> magazines that you need) ; that the accounts servant has sufficient subscription record sheets; that there is an adequate supply of bound books and booklets; that the back-call servant has his file in order for calling back on all having previously manifested interest; and that the territory servant has the territory in readiness. He will also see to it that there are sufficient subscription blanks on hand for both magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Proper advance preparation will also include thorough consideration of the campaign at the service meetings. The various features of the subscription campaign should be clearly outlined to the publishers</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Properly Handling Subscriptions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Speed Service by Your Careful Checking</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">By checking all subscriptions carefully when obtained publishers can eliminate the most frequent causes for nondelivery of magazines and greatly aid the Society to handle this work more promptly. Note the following questions and check yourself on them when you fill out subscription slips.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. Has every space on the slip been filled in, giving all the Information that the slip requests?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. Is it </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">neatly</span><span class="font2"> printed? Could you read It </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">at a glance</span><span class="font2"> if you had not seen the name and address before?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. Did the subscriber check the slip himself after you filled it out and tell you that you had the correct and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">complete</span><span class="font2"> address (including city and state) at which he gets his mail? Did he initial it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. If you are in a large city, did you ask the subscriber for his postal zone number?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5. If it is for a foreign language, did you write this in the UPPER RIGHT-HAND corner of the subscription slip?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Next, the accounts servant should check each time he sends in subscriptions to the Society by asking himself these questions:</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>1949 “Yearbook” and Calendar</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">All publishers have been looking forward to receiving the president’s report on the results of our worldwide service of praise. The thrilling report for the service year just past is now available in the 1949 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font2"> at 50c a copy. This valuable report should be read by everyone who is interested in the Kingdom and the world-wide expansion of its publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Also available is the new calendar. It prominently displays the text for the coming year above a beautiful illustration of an aerial view of Gilead. The calendar pad gives the names of the six Testimony Periods and service themes for the intervening months. Calendars are 25c each, or 5 for $1.00 when sent to one address. Company servants should Immediately determine the requirements of all publishers, pioneers and persons of good-will associated with the company and send a combined order on the regular order blank. It should be remembered that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbooks</span><span class="font2"> and calendars are cash items. Each order should be accompanied by a remittance to cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and with such enthusiasm as to fire all with zeal to have a vital part therein. Definite group arrangements should be made so that each one will know where and with whom he will work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Individually, there should also be proper advance preparation. Each publisher should be fully equipped with sample copies, subscription blanks, books; booklets, territory, and his own testimony. Then, with heart full of appreciation for the privilege, let each one ‘show belief for final salvation’ by thinking subscriptions, talking subscriptions and obtaining subscriptions, to the end that 1949 will witness many more thousands regularly reading and benefiting from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoioer</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> magazines.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. Are all addresses clear </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">correct? (It is easier to ask the publisher before it Is sent In than after the slip is in our files.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">2.</span><span class="font2"> Are the subscriptions properly listed on the latest subscription record sheet and the money for subscriptions entered thereon?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">8. Is the company name on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font2">slip that is listed on the record sheet (including renewals, pioneer subscriptions and foreign-language subscriptions), and is this company name the same name that is on the top of the record sheet? (The purpose of the company’s name appearing on the slip is to identify it with the record sheet, if necessary, after they have been separated.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">4. Is just </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font2"> check, money order, or postal note enclosed to cover all of the subscriptions?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5. Are the slips placed loosely inside the folded record sheet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font2">stapled or fastened in any way, in exactly the order that they are listed on the record sheet?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">0. Are all </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions listed first, followed on the same record sheet with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font2">subscriptions, instead of mixing the two?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">7. Are subscriptions sent in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font2">week, no matter how few there are, but no oftener than this?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">8. Does the company servant carefully check all these points before he signs the record sheet?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">If each publisher and each accounts servant can answer “yes” to the questions listed above for him, very few subscribers will fail to receive their magazines and the work in the office here can be handled much more promptly. Let each of us combine our zeal in obtaining subscriptions with a similar zeal in handling them and filling out the necessary forms.</span></p>

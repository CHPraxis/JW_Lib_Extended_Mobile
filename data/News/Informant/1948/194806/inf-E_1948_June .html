<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Stress Back-Call and Public Meeting Activity</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Love for the Provider of the hope of everlasting life and its attendant blessings prompts sincere persons to learn God’s righteous requirements, and, having learned, to act in harmony therewith. To faithful servants, then, God’s command to ‘‘love thy neighbour as thyself” (Lev. 19:18) is full of meaning. During the month of June, which has been set aside as ‘‘Neighbob Love” Testimony Period, they will make special effort to show love for their neighbors by bringing them God’s truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One way to show love for our neighbor in June is by participating in the distribution of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 35c. Were we not overjoyed and moved to praise our Creator when we first read these two remarkable publications? Could we honestly say, then, that we love our neighbor as much as ourselves if we fail to present these truth-containing publications to him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But the showing of love is not fulfilled by simply appearing at the door of the neighbor with the publications. Our presentation of the message should be enthusiastic and motivated by a real concern for<sup>-</sup> the welfare of the hearer. He undoubtedly has many problems in these days of distress. The answer to every such problem is found in the Bible, and the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> can assist the inquiring one to find the answer quickly. We can be of greatest assistance to our neighbor by endeavoring to consider </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font2"> point of view and by being kind and tactful. Then problems once seeming big to him become of little consequence in new-found knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Knowledge of the contents of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font2"> will enable the publisher to stress the vital points and accomplish the most in the usually brief time that is available when calling from door to door. Call attention to these main points by referring to the table of contents, questions that you have noted in previous study or the subject and scripture indexes. It would be difficult and time-consuming for the publisher to answer all the questions and objections of the householder without </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”. </span><span class="font2">It would be even more difficult for this “neighbor” to gather together this fund of information by himself. It is, therefore, an act of love and unselfishness to get </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font2"> into every home possible, and to instruct the obtainers how to use them most effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Love by Calling Back</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While a study may not result from every placement of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font2"> let this not be because of our failure to properly show love for our neighbors. Consider each interested person as a prospective study. Diligence will bring heartcheering results. Then, when studies are started, be dependable, calling back regularly, assisting them to advance. Only by so doing can the desired results be expected, that is, an increase in devoted servants of God showing love for their neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, these neighbors with whom we are studying will not usually begin to publish without special assistance. Therefore, we must continue to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prove</span><span class="font2"> that we love our neighbors “as ourselves” by patiently helping them to confess with their mouths, that they may gain life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So important is the calling back upon our neighbors who have shown ; interest, either by obtaining litera-I ture or otherwise, that a service I meeting in June should be set aside for the consideration of the back-call and book-study work, emphasizing particularly studies in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font2"> Points that might be included in this meeting are: publisher preparation (such as noting topics the individual is interested in and looking up further information on the subject before calling back), demonstrations on making the initial back-call and converting back-calls into book studies, arrangements to improve local back-call activity, results of consistent back-call and book-study work, experiences, assisting the new ones to publish, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Features of the Work Continue</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During June, other features of the work will continue to be stressed. We can show love for our neighbors by faithfully participating in the advertising of the public meetings, and then attending ourselves so that we can further assist the people of good-will who attend. Magazine work, as well as the distribution of leaflets on the streets, will now be more effective since the coming warm spring days will bring more people out and the publishers can remain for longer periods of time. Nor should we overlook the advantages and possibilities of outdoor meetings. Many companies have already begun to have outdoor meetings in conjunction with intensified witness in rural districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our desire for life, not only for ourselves, but also for our goodwill neighbor whom we love as ourselves, will motivate us to continued faithful service to our Creator during June, as we bring to a close the two months of distribution of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font2"> and participate fully in the “Neighbor Love” ‘Testimony Period.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Making Remittances</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Use New Remittance Form</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Included with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> is a supply of a new remittance form (S-52), which is to replace the old form, beginning July 1, 1948. To avoid confusion, copies of the old form should be discarded and only the new form used </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font2"> that date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Instructions for its proper use appear on the back of the form. It is to be used by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">both companies and pioneers</span><span class="font2"> whenever a remittance is sent to the Society, except when the remittance is for subscriptions only. (Whenever possible pioneers should obtain literature from company stocks and remit to the company at the time of getting literature.) Whenever subscriptions are sent, that remittance should be shown on the Subscription Record sheet (S-10). Do not enter any money on the Subscription Record sheet except that which is for subscriptions. That is, after July 1 the remittance form on the old Subscription Record sheet should not be used to request credits for literature or magazine accounts. If the remittance includes monies for the literature or magazine accounts, the new remittance form should be used and the entire remittance listed on It, including the amount to be applied toward subscriptions, which is also shown on the Subscription Record sheet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies may continue to use their present supply of Order Blanks (S-5), but the remittance form which appears on it will no longer be used. Use the separate new remittance form instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The remittance form should be filled out carefully, completely and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in duplicate.</span><span class="font2"> Write plainly, please. The original is to be sent to the Society with the remittance, and the duplicate copy kept in the company files. Be sure to fill in the date, complete name and address of the company (or pioneer) and the number of the check or money order, in the spaces provided. The moneyorder stub might be pinned to the company’s copy of the remittance form, for a record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society will no longer send credit memos to acknowledge receipt of remittances, nor will remittances be entered at the bottom of the invoice. The Society will henceforth acknowledge receipt of your remittances on the monthly statement only. The company will then have a complete record of credits and debits of its account on one slip, the statement. The remittance will be identified on the statement by the date and by the number of the check or money order, as well as by the amount. Hence, all checks should be numbered and the remittance form dated. When a small slip marked “Duplicate copy of your cash item order” is sent to you with a shipment of cash items, the money you remitted for these cash items will not appear on any statement. The slip constitutes acknowledgment of the remittance. When subscriptions alone are sent, the remittance</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>European Relief</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">It has come to the attention of the Society that individuals in Germany and other countries of Europe have addressed letters to Jehovah’s witnesses and the Society in principal cities throughout the United States. These letters contain requests for food and clothing. Often when investigations are made it is found that the persons who make requests in such manner are not Kingdom publishers, and are sometimes opposers. The Society has a Branch oilice in Germany to distribute the relief materials fairly among the worthy persons, and it is therefore suggested that the brethren forward letters from Europe to the Society, so the requesting individuals may be investigated before help is sent. If the person in Europe is known to you, it is all right to send help, if you see fit.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>New Magazine Letter</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">A copy of a new magazine letter is being sent to each company and pioneer. It contains information on how to order, the opening of magazine accounts, amount of remittance to send for subscriptions, etc. All servants and pioneers should give the letter diligent study, and it should also be considered at service meetings, so that everyone can be acquainted with this material. The careful following of these instructions will make possible the efficient handling of magazine orders and accounts and an expansion in this important feature of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">is not acknowledged, other than by the sending of the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When the monthly statement is received, the accounts servant should check it against the duplicate copies of the remittance form which he keeps on file. Invoices will be sent as before. Credit memos will be used only to notify the company of adjustments in accounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If it is necessary to write the Society about a remittance, always refer to the date it was sent, the number of the check or other instrument, the amount and the name of the company or pioneer. It is not advisable to send cash by mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All companies should endeavor to send their remittances during the first ten days of every month. Having checked the inventory and the other records at the end of the month, it would be good for all companies to make a remittance within the first ten days of the next month, using this new remittance form, as well as send in their order for literature they will need. Check the remittance form carefully before applying for the money order or making out checks. Wherever possible, send only one remittance each month. Accounts servants should give this matter careful consideration. Close attention to the use of the new remittance form and the sending in of remittances properly and on time will greatly facilitate the handling of this work in the office, and will permit better service to the brethren.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>to Be Featured</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>July Suitable for Rural Activity</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah God, the giver of every good and perfect gift, has provided a gracious means whereby men can gain salvation, and that salvation is guaranteed by praise. Hence the psalmist's words resound from our lips: “I will call upon the Loan, who is' worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.” (Ps. 18:3) Such proper praise is that which upholds the true worship of Jehovah, and thus opens the way for all men of good-will to gain salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">How Praise?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the month of July we will praise Jehovah by going from house to house presenting the book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”,</span><span class="font2"> and the new booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 35c. Most companies will have ordered and received their shipment of this splendid booklet, and, when its distribution begins in July, will be able to include it in every offer. Truly the peoples constantly perplexed by anxiety and unrest need today more than ever before the comforting message of the Kingdom that announces the sure remedy for world distress. Kingdom publishers, then, will review these publications and become familiar with their contents, in order to give a clear presentation of the Kingdom message at the doors. The book, with its effective narrative style, treats the Kingdom subject thoroughly, from the original Edenic promise down to its final fulfillment in the new world. The new booklet can be used to show’ that Jehovah has already provided the King of this new world in his permanent Governor of all nations. His ambassador-publishers will endeavor to leave a copy of the new booklet in every home. At the service meetings, effective demonstrations outlining points the publishers can use in the field will be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Praise that guarantees salvation includes making back-calls. These should by no means be neglected. Publishers placing the book and booklet in the field should note the interest shown by the recipient and, on the back-call, should endeavor to further his interest. The many bound books that were placed during June provide good ground for book studies. Those not at present conducting a book study should follow up previous placements, and, by diligent effort, have a part in this important work of praise. Experienced study conductors can lend much practical assistance. A book study should be the ultimate goal of each publisher in placing literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Do Not Forget the Rurals</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Territory previously covered in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign and with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> can be covered again with the July offer. But many companies have territory that has not been worked with any of these offers. Concentrate on this territory, especially the rural areas, where, in many cases, the people have not been witnessed to in many months. Servants should take the lead in working this and other territory, that the number of praisers of God’s name may continue to increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Summer brings good weather and</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">opportunity for outdoor public meetings. Jehovah richly blessed the out- j door public meetings last year, and i many people of good-will were aided thereby. Servants should be on the alert to find suitable places to hold these meetings. Thought should be given to the comfort of the people that come. Cool, shady lots with suitable seats should be selected wherever possible. Consideration of the direction of the wind, and providing for sound equipment, if available, will enable the audience to hear better. Good planning and support by the publishers and pioneers are certain to result in Jehovah’s blessing on these meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rendering praise to Jehovah, Kingdom publishers understand the way to salvation: “And let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.” (Ps. 70:4) During this month we will let God be magnified by rendering praise to him, for continued praise guarantees salvation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">In some states the school trustees or boards of education are, by law, required to permit the use of school buildings and school auditoriums for community gatherings. If such is the case, the school may be compelled by law to open up the rooms to Jehovah’s witnesses, if they are used by others for civic purposes or community gatherings. If denied the use of such buildings in states where the law allows the school to be used, communicate with the Society.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The above report for April is indeed encouraging. Besides maintaining the striking peak of publishers reached in March, we have made a slight additional increase, causing us to reach a new all-time peak of 76,639 publishers. It is manifest that the “other sheep” are being found and are responding to the message of truth. Further increases are certain as we continue to sing forth the praises of Jehovah as he has commanded. Keep up the good work!</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Is Pioneering for You?</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Over 1,000 Have Answered “Yes”!</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Over 1,000 new pioneers since January 1, with over 500 of these enrolling since April 1! These are thrilling figures that testify to pioneer expansion in 104S. And all indications are that this increase is just </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">beginning.</span><span class="font2"> Daily, pioneer application requests pour into the ollice, accompanied by expressions of heartfelt gratitude and joy, such as: “We were in a demonstration in connection with the pioneer letters and our arguments were so convincing that we convinced ourselves.” Scores of brethren are realizing the wisdom and practicability of the full-time pioneer service. Are you? Have you thoroughly considered the possibility of pioneer activity? If not, the Society urges you to prayerfully and carefully reconsider your three personal-invitation letters to pioneer service. Discuss the matter with successful, experienced pioneers and other qualified brethren. Perhaps it will yet be possible for you to join hundreds of others in happily saying: “Please send me an application for pioneer service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A Call to Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The need for pioneers in certain sections of the United States is particularly great. To meet this need the Society recommends that those general pioneers who find themselves in position to do so take up pioneering in one of these states where the population is great and tlie publishers few, to compare with the rest of the United States. Pub-lisher-to-population ratios for the states below range from 1-4,200 to i-z,iuv. xney are of their need.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Of course, if some are able to pioneer only because of living at home, they should remain and advance the Kingdom interests there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A word of admonition to those now pioneering is timely. Almost half of 1948 has passed and those pioneers who began working January 1 should have nearly reached the 700-hour mark of the 1,400-hour yearly quota. Those who have not done so should plan now to increase their hours during the summer months, bearing in mind the coming winter weather.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Organize Street Witnessing</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Co-operation Necessary for</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Best Results</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The worth-while work being done in the earth today is that related to the reconstruction of true worship. Appreciation of that fact will inspire us with zeal for service in all its various features. However, if our efforts are to be effective and accomplish Jehovah's purpose, our zeal must be accompanied by knowledge and understanding, not only of how to carry on each feature of the work individually, but also of how to work together, co-operating mutually for the best interests of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among our varied, forms of service to Jehovah is that of street witnessing. The public meeting campaign has resulted in more time being devoted to this form of activity, especially handbill distribution ; but lack of organization in some companies has prevented this added time spent from being as effective as it should be. Organization and co-operation are essential. How, then, can street witnessing be better organized?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Organizing the Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font2"> the advertising servant is, among other things, responsible for the proper organization of the street witness work, co-operating closely with other servants to see that handbills are properly distributed on street corners and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">from door to door, </span><span class="font2">as well as for assigning territory for street magazine work. It would be well to indicate not only the location of such assignments but also the best time and the kind of street work to be done. There are certain street corners on which it would be well to have publishers from morning until late at night on Saturdays, one publisher taking over when another leaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Both magazine publishers and those distributing handbills can be assigned to the same corner at the same time, co-operating together. By keeping both handbill and magazine distribution going simultaneously, the piling up of unused magazines will be avoided, and it will result in a greater combined witness. Publishers might alternate, engaging in magazine work one week and handbill distribution the next. All should be glad to co-operate with the servants in taking care of assigned territory at designated hours, so that ail time devoted to this work may be most effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Having received such an assignment, the publisher should be regular, dependable. When he is engaging in street magazine work he should be alert, stand erect, be friendly and call out appropriate slogans in an appealing manner, giving no suspicion of weariness. He should be quick to note people standing near by and to approach them, giving a brief but effective witness regarding the magazines; and, of course, always be prepared to place the subscription offer. He should also carry a few handbills to give to those manifesting some interest.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Spread of Light to Awaken Bedarkened World</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Nineteen centuries ago Jehovah fulfilled his promise to provide the Messiah as the Savior and King of the world. The appearing of Christ Jesus fulfilled the fondest hopes of men of righteousness and touched off the greatest educational campaign ever undertaken up until that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The world in its bedarkened state, tainted with Jewish tradition and heathen superstition, needed more than ever the glorious light which ■would awaken it to the importance of true worship. Fittingly, Paul, an apostle of the Messiah, wrote, “Now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.”—Rom. 13:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yes, even back there it was time to awake and serve the true and living God, Jehovah, and his anointed King. It is even more important that men awake in this day and acknowledge his son whom he has enthroned as ‘King for all the earth’.—Ps. 45:1,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Presentation of “Awake!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">October has been chosen as the month that will enable all Christians to give the peoples of earth an opportunity to awake and to be mindful of the times in which we live. This will be done by all publishers’ diligently supporting the service schedule for October, which will be high-lighted by the presentation of a year’s subscription for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> magazine at the subscription rate of $1.00. Each publisher should strive to obtain at least one subscription, and companies should endeavor to place subscriptions to the number of their quota of publishers for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Preparations by servants and publishers alike should already be underway to make this an outstanding campaign. Servants should make preparations by carefully outlining the campaign and adapting it to the local c o m p a n y. Demonstrations should be planned in order to aid the publishers to better present the magazine in the field. Arrangements can be made to have publishers who have obtained subscriptions relate their experiences for the benefit of the congregation during the month. A sufficient number of distributor copies should be on hand, and plenty of subscription slips for use in the field and on the street. Territories and back-calls should be lined up for group witnessing, and especially should arrangements be made to cover the small towns and rurals that were not covered during the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> campaign conducted the first of this year. This provides good opportunity to cover the rural territory before the w’inter sets in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Individual Preparation Essential</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Publishers should study thoroughly the material in the copies they plan to use as samples in order to demonstrate the beneficial value of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> to truth seekers. Briefly but explicitly outline its features when presenting it at the doors and on the street. Give a copy of the magazine to the householder and let him leaf through it; undoubtedly one or more of the variety of subjects will appeal to him. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> contains timely articles on present-day happenings, political, religious, and commercial, which show the significance of such happenings in the light of Bible prophecy; educational and instructive information on the natural wonders that Jehovah has created; “Thy Word Is Truth,” giving pertinent information on doctrinal subjects; and geographical topics which acquaint one with countries all over the world. To round out its coverage of vital information, a condensed summary of world news is given. All of this, geared to a purpose of magnifying the name of Jehovah and his King, Christ Jesus, makes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font1">a magazine worthy to be in the home of every person who desires to learn the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Back-calls, also, on the subscribers for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> can be very effectively conducted. On calling back to check delivery, one might consider the subject explained in “Thy Word Is Truth,” and thus open the way for a detailed study of the Bible using </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;.</span><span class="font1"> Certainly all present back-calls and book studies should be given the opportunity to subscribe for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font1"> is also published in a number of other languages. Subscriptions can be accepted for the German and the Afrikaans (each semimonthly) ; the Danish, French, Greek, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish. and Ukrainian (each published monthly). However, please specify plainly on the upper right-hand corner of the subscription slip if one of these languages is desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For those who desire to do so, the offer used in September may be combined, that is, an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> subscription and three bound books witli the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations,</span><span class="font1"> for a contribution of $2.00. Pioneers and publishers working in rural territory are especially encouraged to use this combination, but </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> should be presented in every instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Full co-operation and a sincere desire on the part of all publishers to educate old and young, rich and poor, bond and free, in the glorious truth of God’s Word will bring</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Making Remittances</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The way in which the majority of the companies have adapted themselves to the use of the new remittance form is very gratifying. A few, however, are experiencing some difficulty. It should be noted, as previous instructions have pointed out, that the new remittance form (S-52) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">replaces</span><span class="font1"> all other remittance forms, including the one on the present order blank. Some companies have been listing their cash item remittances on the order blank instead of sending a remittance form. This should not be done. Nothing should be listed on the order blank remittance form. If you send money with your order, one of the new remittance forms should be filled out and sent with it and a duplicate retained in your files. This form is to be used for all company and pioneer remittances except those that are solely for subscriptions. If your remittance is only for subscriptions it will not be necessary to use a remittance form. The cost of the subscriptions can be shown on the top of the subscription record sheet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A remittance must accompany all orders for cash items except when an actual credit balance due you is shown on your account. If cash items are ordered w’ith campaign literature the remittance for such will be credited to your account at the time it is received by the Society and then the cash items will be charged on the invoice along with the campaign literature, thereby balancing the credit that has been previously made. Sometimes the invoice will not be listed on the statement until the following month. In this instance it will be necessary for the accounts servant, as he checks the monthly statement, to take into consideration the fact that money has been applied to the account for cash items that have not yet been charged to that account. Please fill out the Remittance Form </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">completely </span><span class="font1">each time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Companies and pioneers may order additional supplies of the remittance forms as they are needed. They will be furnished free.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Readiness Essential to an Equipped Ministry</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">“Ready always to give an answer . . . in season and out of season.” Ready to preach the gospel. Ready to teach the gospel. Ready to defend the gospel. Indeed, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">readiness</span><span class="font1"> is an essential to a fully equipped ministry. This readiness to minister is ably illustrated in the exemplary course of Christ Jesus, his apostles and his disciples. They exhorted one another in the faith, taught men of good-will concerning the Kingdom, and reproved religionists for their role of false ministers. They defended the ministry before “kings and rulers” and preached the gospel to all men. They were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ready</span><span class="font1"> ministers of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So, too, modern-day public servants of God earnestly strive for this quality of readiness in their everyday ministry. To aid them in being thus prepared, the Lord has made available many instruments to equip the Theocratic minister, among which is the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship</span><span class="font1"> contains features that are fitted for immediate action. The Christian’s basic study and training receives deserved attention, as does proof of Scriptural ordination cherished by each consecrated servant. The minister’s equipment passes in review, followed by a consideration of Theocratic tactfulness. Of use to every field minister is the coverage of gospel presentation in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship.</span><span class="font1"> Finally, the primary feature and purpose of the booklet, proper legal and Christian procedure in readily defending the true ministry before ‘kings and rulers’, receives thorough treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Because of the influx of new ministers into the organization who are unfamiliar with its contents, a study of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship</span><span class="font1"> is most timely. Seasoned ministers will also benefit by renewing their knowledge of the booklet. A capable brother should conduct the study in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship,</span><span class="font1"> and sufficient time on the service meeting program should be devoted to its consideration. Practical demonstrations can be arranged, especially on those portions of the booklet having a direct bearing on local Theocratic ministry. Of course, individual study of its contents will not be neglected by ready Kingdom ambassadors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We nave all the more reason for obtaining a working knowledge of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of W o r sh i p</span><span class="font1"> since the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's Servants Defended</span><span class="font1"> is now out of stock. However, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's Servants Defended</span><span class="font1"> is still timely and should be used as heretofore by those possessing copies. Do not send orders for this booklet, as they cannot now be filled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship</span><span class="font1"> is, without doubt, an asset to the ready minister in properly answering every man regarding the Kingdom hope within him. Study it carefully. Utilize its suggestions.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Expanded Book-Study Service to Climax</span><br><br><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>1948 Calendar Year</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Reeling under the deadly blows of two world wars and faced with another that threatens doom to civilization, weary men and nations take desperate steps to keep their shaky peace. Raise high the stock-pile of A-bombs! Search out new and more destructive secret weapons! Build up the armed forces to an all-time high! Maybe thus, their dulled senses reason, will a third world war be held off. Do the nations, however, really want peace, as they claim? Let them, then, behold and copy the ways of the one organization of unity and peace today, Jehovah’s witnesses. But why do these enjoy what this world vainly seeks? It is because of their daily, united worship and praise, not of dying men and systems and the god of war, Satan, but of the great God of peace and His Prince of Peace, Jehovah and Christ Jesus. And Jehovah’s people are determined to “keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace” by a steadily expanding united praise even to the very end of this evil world.—Eph. 4: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Praisers Spread Peace with “Let God Be True”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">United praise during November will carry Jehovah’s peacemakers in every state, city and village to the doors of thousands upon thousands of persons who yearn for peace but know not where to find it. The very appearance on the doorstep of an ambassador of peace, with sincere, joyful countenance and clean apparel, will favorably impress the goodwill householder. As the Theocratically-trained tongue utters words of godly truth about the presence of the long-prayed-for kingdom of peace, a hearing ear inclines itself, and a searching heart and mind stir with a measure of hope. But how wonderfully is the want and need for a message of peace further satisfied by placement in their hands of that excelling Bible-study aid, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True’’,</span><span class="font1"> together with a booklet, either </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Governor of All Nations</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People! </span><span class="font1">Talking pointedly and enthusiastically about the book’s attractive and educational features, united prais-ers will find numerous opportunities to expand peace and joy among their many “neighbors” with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase in Book Studies Anticipated</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">United praise does not limit itself to the oral and printed message imparted at the doors. Were this the extent of the minister’s praise, few indeed would enter Into the full, satisfying peace they crave. Back to the same territory did the “Prince of Peace” go to “preach the word” further, in a house, to interested hearers. (Mark 2; 1,2) Up into a chariot did Philip climb, there to sit down and study the Scriptures with a newly interested one, and thus prepare him for a life of godly praise. (Acts 8: 26-40) To the homes of the people, then, or wherever interested ones may be reached, will Jehovah’s praisers at this end of the world return, again and again, to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">study</span><span class="font1"> with Bible believers the truths of God’s Word, and thus prepare added thousands for a life as ministerial praisers of the God of peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Make expansion in book-study service, individual and company, your goal for November and December. Talk up book studies at the service meeting, around the family table, in homes of good-will. Bridge back-calls into Bible book studies, and give all the aid possible </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to one </span><span class="font1">another to improve this vital feature of the minister’s praise to Jehovah. Work toward the goal of at least one book study per publisher, and bring to a climax the calendar year of 1948 with a notable expansion in the only service on earth that spreads true peace among men of good-will, equipping them for God’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Booklets will undoubtedly exceed books in number placed. Why not, then, make the most of your opportunity to start up studies in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perma-nant Governor of All Nations</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People?</span><span class="font1"> Paragraphs read and discussed, scriptures looked up, questions entertained and the theme of the booklet emphasized, and much joy enters the home of persons who hunger after truth, through an easily-arranged booklet study. Greater still will be their appreciation and benefit, however, as the alert minister arranges for placement and regular study of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">United praise during November will mean all ministers of God, including the recently consecrated ones, moving out from tbeir private dwellings into the open field of public praise. There, from door to door and on the streets, and by an increase in home Bible book studies they will speak peace to men of good-will. Keep and spread peace by keeping busy as united praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Pioneers’ Change of Address</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">When pioneers change their residence, they should always send a Change of Address slip showing what their full new address will be, allowing us about two (2) weeks to make the change in our stencils. Every time you change your address, be sure to leave your forwarding address at the post office where you </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">previously</span><span class="font1"> obtained your mail. If, after changing your address, you get mail that has been forwarded from your old address, be sure to check to see if you sent us a Change of Address slip and if it has had time to be acted upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When changing your address, always use the form provided by the Society for this purpose. Every pioneer should have a supply of these on hand. It is not convenient to make a change of address when it is written in a letter with othei’ correspondence, as Change of Address slips are handled separately from other mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneers should always designate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">clearly</span><span class="font1"> whether they are “Special Pioneer” or “General Pioneer”, as delays are caused by a failure to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Second-, third- and fourth-class matter cannot be forwarded without additional postage; therefore all such mail must be sent direct to the correct address in order to insure prompt delivery.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Proof of Expansion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Expansion? Yes, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">expansion.</span><span class="font1"> Of what? Of the true worship in the earth. When? Now! Proof? Consider: Last March we had a peak of publishers by more than 2,800 over our previous peak, in April, 1947. That was expansion. Then what? Did we slack the hand in April? No, but with the Lord’s help we did still better in April. And May? Another peak. And June? Another, though slight, yet still upward. And now July, another peak, and that by more than 1,800 publishers. Five months in a row! Yes, today we see expansion in this land, even as the Lord through his prophet Isaiah long ago foretold.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The Lord gives the increase if we but do our part, and the report shows that we are doing it. Without doubt, the district assemblies, the circuit assemblies, the visits of the servants to the brethren, the pioneers, the servants in companies as well as the individual company publishers, all had a share in the increase. The brethren are appreciating their privilege of helping others, and so the work goes forward. Let us continue to do so, to Jehovah’s praise, to the salvation of others as well as ourselves and to our ever-increasing joy.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Its Purpose and Use</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Even the remotest corners of the globe are now hearing the song of praise sung to Jehovah as a growing number of ministers sing with ever-increasing effectiveness. Comparatively small though the work of each individual may be, the cumulative result of harmonious effort is a resounding shout of praise to the Creator! No other work on earth is of greater importance or more worthy of every creature’s unstinted effort. Everyone must hear that the King now reigns ! The announcing of the Kingdom is far too important for even one voice to be lost or misdirected, whether that one be a pioneer, missionary in foreign service, isolated publisher, or one working in conjunction with a large company or unit. This unity of effort requires instruction, and such is provided monthly for our field service through the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> in effect a monthly service visit from the Society, brings reports on the results of previous activity, current organization instructions and directions for future campaigns. It is eagerly received and carefully studied by ministers who seek after greater effectiveness in the field. It contains instructions on how to most effectively utilize the “meat in due season” provided by the “faithful and wise servant”, the Society. That is why the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> is carefully considered at the weekly service meetings. Wise ministers will endeavor to get the most possible from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> on such occasions by listening attentively and participating to the fullest extent possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But how should the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> be treated at these meetings, that its full value may be realized? Questions and answers with a final reading of the paragraph is a good method, provided that the questions are thoughtfully prepared in advance. One could not hope to accomplish the best results by hurriedly preparing the questions a few minutes before the meeting. Articles can be profitably covered too by means of extemporaneous talks. The speaker, however, must carefully analyze the material and cover it thoroughly, inserting material of his own when it serves to advance or illustrate the points of the article but not at the expense of instructions which it contains. The same may be said of dialogues or demonstrations. Discover the main thoughts of each paragraph and put those thoughts across, tying them in with local service where necessary. The planning and effort necessary to accomplish this within the time alloted will be well worth while, as it will reflect in more efficient service by all who attend the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Company servants in particular will see to it that the contents of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> are thoroughly covered and that assignments are given sufficiently in advance so that proper preparation can be made. Give clear instructions as to how the material is to be treated, and offer such assistance as may be necessary, yet allow the one assigned to work out the details as much as possible for the sake of variety in presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> is your servant. Let it work for you by deriving all of the instruction possible from each issue, to the end that all God’s ministers will work in harmony and unison and the gospel will reach yet unnumbered persons of good-will.</span></p>

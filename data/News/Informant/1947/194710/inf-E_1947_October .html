<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Join in the Onward March</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Concentrate on Home Bible-Study Activity</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Press on in Jehovah's service, fearless against the conspiracy of his enemies. That was a fundamental part of the instruction received by God’s people at their mighty assembly in Cleveland, the first large-scale gathering since the dark days of restraint imposed by the nations at war. And no wonder! There we reviewed Jehovah’s faithful preservation and deliverance of those who put their trust in him. We realized, too, that a vast scope of Kingdom activity still lies ahead, not with the favor of the nations, but in spite of all they will attempt to prevent it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Additionally, the conspiracy of the nations to perpetuate the abomination of desolation was clearly outlined. As commanded by Jehovah, his people will heed the instruction : “Neither fear ye their fear, nor be In dread thereof.” (Isa. 8:12, Am. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font2"> God’s people gladly obey this admonition as presented in our service text for October. They will press on in zealous use of all their service privileges, “fearless against conspiracy,” “for God is with us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Place &quot;Let God Be True”, Start Home Bible Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">October has therefore been set aside as the “Feabless Against Conspiracy” Testimony Period. It is the ideal time throughout the country for all-out service activity, and we feel confident there will not be an idle hand anywhere. That powerful weapon of the Lord’s people, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 35c, is to be the offer for the month. Activity will now swing from tlie rurals to the towns and cities and a vigorous effort made there to acquaint the people with the many benefits to be gained from the study of this valuable Bible help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The object of specializing on the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> is thus easily seen as a definite movement to establish as many book studies as possible. Everyone who takes the book should be given full assistance in understanding its contents. There is nothing to indicate that the people will be anxiously waiting for a study to be held with them. On the contrary, the small spark of interest that caused them to take the book originally fades out in a good many cases, and it is necessary to rekindle and fan that interest into an actual desire to learn more of God’s Word. This can be done only if the publisher goes back with a well-defined object in view; he must have in mind the exact method to use in developing the interest to the point of starting a study in the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For instance, if someone at the first call had seemed interested in the possibility that wars should some day cease, make a note of that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font2">your House to House Record</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Period</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>of Jehovah’s Fearless Ones</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">form, and when you make the back-call have the necessary facts and scriptures ready to fully explain the subject. Show the person that the subject is specifically dealt with in chapter 20, paragraph 8, of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font2"> and from that point on not only demonstrate how the book clears up that matter, but show that an appreciation and understanding of the entire Word of God can be obtained by a continuation of the study. Apply all the instruction and knowledge you have gained in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study, service meeting, Theocratic ministry school, as well as your personal study of God’s Word, so that you may efficiently feed these &quot;other sheep&quot; of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Remember the Quota, One Study for Each Publisher</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When people tell us they have already obtained the book, instead of trying to place still more literature, or just moving on to the next home, find out if the book has been read, or what progress is being made in learning the truths it contains. Without doubt, you will see the need of stimulating the interest all over again. The urgent need of studying with the people cannot be overstated. This day of judgment puts the necessity upon all men to make their choice of life or death, and blessed is that one who joyfully gives of his time and energy to aid others in this serious decision. Remember the quota, one book study for every publisher, and all strive to attain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers and special publishers will also move, primarily, back into town and city sections of their territory to co-operate in this great fall and winter campaign; so a most intensive and unified effort on the part of all God’s servants is anticipated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Everyone to Share in Publicity Effort</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In conjunction with the bookstudy activity, the Lord’s people will be right out in full view, also, making known the Kingdom gospel in public meeting activity and street work. October’s weather is usually ideal for every feature of Kingdom service; so let every company arrange for a series of public meetings. Advertise thoroughly and support tlie effort by a complete turnout of all in the company. None should feel that because they have heard a lecture once or twice it is unprofitable to attend. The meeting is yours, and every publisher should go to it with the direct objectives in mind of aiding any of good-will who attend, backing up the speaker in his efforts, and receiving information that will be for his own good in future Kingdom service. Faithful effort in this direction will bring rich blessings of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Stand on the streets also, lifting up the message of truth as a sure</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Philadelphia Convention</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Request Rooms and /</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The assembly of Jehovah's witnesses at Philadelphia, November 21-23, 1947, is of special interest to all brethren living east of the Mississippi river, particularly those who did not have the opportunity to attend the recent Los Angeles convention. Commodious Convention Hall, 34th Street near Spruce, provides good facilities for this gathering of Jehovah’s servants, and it is anticipated that all companies in the East will be well represented. Already a busy group of pioneers and company publishers is at work, securing accommodations and making numerous other preparations necessary in connection with a large convention. Each Theocratic publisher planning to attend can give good assistance in the preparation for this assembly by carefully considering the following suggestions and co-operating to the full with the brethren endeavoring to make things convenient for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Do First</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A supply of the Room Request Form accompanies this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">to your company. Western companies will receive very few, but eastern companies have been allotted a quantity believed to be sufficient for their needs. All publishers should immediately make up their groups and fill out the necessary Room Request Form. Please note that one form is to be made out for each boom required, including not more than four persons. Read the form over carefully after you have filled it out, to be sure that you have supplied all the information requested. This will avoid delay in handling your request and will thereby benefit you. Mail your form </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">early. </span><span class="font2">to Watchtower Convention, 1343 W. Venango St., Philadelphia 40, Pa. The sooner you get your request in the mail, the better the opportunity for the Rooming Committee to serve you. If more forms are needed, please write to Watchguide to those seeking the way to Zion. Tell others of the good things contained in the columns of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> so that they too may rejoice in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All these different avenues of service open up a wonderful opportunity to completely manifest noncooperation with the worthless efforts of men. Even though this may bring down the wrath of the nations, their fear shall not be our fear, nor will God's servants be in dread of them. By God’s grace we shall prove fearless against their conspiracy, and during the “Fearless Against Conspiracy” Testimony Period see to it that a one-hundred-percent effort is made to magnify Jehovah’s name and cause. Everyone associated with any company in the land, regular or irregular publishers, and even those who may have been inactive for some reason or other, join in the glad work. Take part yourself and try, by God’s grace, to aid others in so doing.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Transportation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">tower Convention Committee, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, N.Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Please note that, due to the shortness of the assembly, there will be no trailer and tent camp. However, the Society hopes to operate a cafeteria for the benefit of the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies within a hundred miles of Philadelphia will receive volunteer service application forms, with an accompanying letter of instructions as to the handling of these. Undoubtedly there will be brethren elsewhere who have skilled trades (plumbers, electricians, carpenters, cooks, etc.) attending the convention, many of whom will be union members. If such brethren can arrive in Philadelphia a few days or a week before the convention begins, and wish to volunteer their services for work, please write to Watchtower Convention. 1343 W. Venango St., Philadelphia 40, Pa., stating your qualifications and advising as to when you can arrive in Philadelphia. The convention servant will write you if your services are needed. If you are a union member, be sure to state which union. The tools and equipment you can bring with you, if needed, should also be listed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Transportation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each company or unit should organize its groups that will be using rail (coach) and bus transportation. Have someone designated to serve as transportation servant and gather information, following through with whatever arrangements are necessary. First, we shall need to get a reasonably accurate estimate of the number of brethren that will be using these means of transportation. Have each one who intends to use rail (coach) or bus transportation turn in a signed slip, stating the type of transportation he intends to use. Advise the brethren of the cost of the round trip by rail (coach) and by bus, so that they can choose. By October 15 the transportation servant should have totaled the slips and reported to Watchtower Convention Transportation, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn 1, N.Y., the number of those intending </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to go</span><span class="font2"> by rail (coach). In cities where there are units, have one general transportation servant for the entire city and have him total the reports and send in the complete figures to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When the reports are received the Society will forward sufficient Convention Assignment slips so that each one intending to use rail (coach) transportation can be given one slip for the going trip and one for the return trip. The transportation servant in each company or unit can fill these out and issue them. They should be issued to the brethren only after they have obtained their rail tickets. The servant can keep a record of the number of slips issued for the going trip </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2. column 8)</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Lend Your Support During November</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">A news release of universal concern now circulates throughout the earth. Surpassing the news-stirring strides at world government by the U.N., eclipsing the headline-making advances in atomic research, comes this news report: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah reigns! </span><span class="font2">Such an unparalleled message is indeed a challenge to men and nations who have wrongly assumed the right to rule. Conversely, it is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> message of hope to God-fearing creatures, one that must receive publicity among the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As the truth regarding Jehovah’s reign ever increases in brilliance, zealous witnesses of God, 200,000 strong, clearly perceive the import of the glad tidings and combine their efforts as publishers of peace and salvation in faithfully announcing Jehovah’s reign in all nations. With this message so essential to eternal existence, how can we afford to be silent for one instant as to heralding it publicly? We can not! Hence, in November we shall continue to ‘bring good tidings of peace and salvation' by publishing among the nations: “Thy God reigneth!” —Isa. 52:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Bring Good Tidings’ with &quot;Let God Be True’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“How beautiful . . . are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings” will be the lot of faithful publishers who proclaim good news during November by presenting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 35c, the offer for the month. Become </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”-conscious</span><span class="font2"> by having demonstrations and practical serv</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Call to God’s Ministers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Make Pioneering Your Life Career</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Among the vital truths repeatedly emphasized at the recent “All Nations Expansion” Assembly was the fact that every Christian is an ordained minister of Jehovah God, a proclaimer of His Word and kingdom. As servants of God and followers of Christ Jesus, preaching the gospel is our primary occupation in life, regardless of what secondary occupation we may have. We engage in such secondary activity only because of force of circumstances to provide things needful and decent. Such activity may change from time to time, but our primary occupation, that of minister, remains the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In view of this fact, does it not unavoidably follow that if circumstances do not demand such secondary activity we dispense with it entirely and devote all our time and energy to our primary occupation of preaching the gospel? Yes, it does; and to the extent that we appreciate the honor of being ministers of Jehovah God and the privilege of bringing life-giving truths to the people, to that extent we will consider seriously the question of our entering the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was also brought to our attention at the assembly that taking up the pioneer work was not merely changing from one job or way of making a living to another. It is the choosing of a career, a life career, one that leads to life. Its purpose and goal is the vindication of Jehovah’s name and the bringing of life to men of good-will; the material subsistence that comes with it is incidental. Only those entering it with an unselfish motive can expect to have the Lord’s blessing. ice talks at service meetings on the month’s presentation, by offering it in the door-to-door work, by stressing the need for studies in it on back-calls, and finally by arranging interesting and instructive meetings with those already studying the book. Indeed, the people are in dire need of an enlightening Bible textbook like </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font2"> and it is our obligation and gracious privilege to continue its distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase Public Meeting Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Publishing God’s reign in all the world presents no unsolved problem to those actively engaged in the public meeting work; nor does the coming cold weather chill their zeal to carry on this feature of Kingdom service. Therefore, plan now to push on in public meeting activity during November and the winter months to follow by arranging for halls, ordering handbills, and caring for other essentials. Devote some time in the service meeting to a discussion of public meetings. Encourage the brethren to advertise and support the meetings locally, and emphasize the need of assisting new interest to attend. A well-planned demonstration would serve as an aid in this behalf. With good servant-publisher co-operation and careful planning public meetings will increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In all our ways during November we shall acknowledge Jehovah as Universal Sovereign, and he will direct our paths so that the “beautiful feet” of gospel-proclaimers will be swift in publishing the news of Jehovah’s reign among the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Success as a Pioneer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To make a success of pioneering one must work hard. Most people do work hard just to make a living. Why not, then, work hard to enjoy the greatest of all careers: the pioneer career? It means taking a real interest in one’s work, presenting the message earnestly and with joy, ever alert to improve one’s ministry ; not letting opposition or indifference discourage, but viewing such as a challenge to be met with increased zeal and resourcefulness. It means patience in teaching the “other sheep”; it means being efficient, systematic and methodical in all one does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Above all, however, pioneering takes faith, for it means marching out on the unknown relying on God’s promise to provide. To see clearly ahead how the Lord will provide does not require faith. Why not show strong faith in God as our Provider by not waiting until we have accumulated the wherewithal to meet future needs?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pioneer field is not overcrowded. There is room for thousands right in this land. Why, half of the counties in the United States have not been witnessed to for from twelve months to nearly fifteen years! The field is large and the laborers are few. The responsibility is upon us to bring to the people the message of comfort and warning. Are you doing all you can to discharge your obligation toward these people and fulfill your commission as a minister? Or are you content to hold on to a secondary job, when you could be making the pioneer service your career? Send for a pioneer application today.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Available Booklets</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The Society has a considerable stock of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government, The “Commander to the Peoples”</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind.</span><span class="font2"> All of these booklets are very timely and contain much good information that should be taken to the people. Since paper shortages restrict the printing of any new booklets, brethren may wish to use these for distribution in conjunction with the campaign offer or in evening booklet work. Companies and pioneers may order a good supply of these booklets and these may be presented in conjunction with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> in October and November, or brethren may drop down from the book offer to three booklets on a contribution of 10c. Companies and pioneers with surplus booklets on hand may likewise arrange for distribution of such in conjunction with the campaign offer of any month.</span></p>

Turn in the totals of this record to the railroad agent with whom you have arranged your transportation, by November 10. This will give the railroad ten days to complete the final equipment arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In many cases it will be possible to combine rail (coach) travel into “special train” or “special coach” arrangements. After a report is sent to Watchtower Convention Transportation it will be possible for the Society to advise various companies how to co-ordinate their efforts. Each company can arrange its bus groups without reporting to the Society, as it is rarely possible to combine these with other groups. Those brethren intending to travel by air or Pullman should make their own reservations for the round trip. It is doubtful that there would be enough using these means of travel to organize any groups from one point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since the convention will close on Sunday evening, November 23, all traveling by rail or bus will leave within a matter of a few hours after the closing session. Travel is very heavy out of Philadelphia on Sunday nights. Be certain to have definite return arrangements and be orderly and patient at the stations when waiting in line or boarding trains or busses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Company servants should give careful attention to these matters regarding the convention, so that the brethren are accommodated.

<p><span class="font2">The eyes of the world focus upon Jehovah’s witnesses, especially when they do street witnessing. Among those who watch are disheartened persons of good-will, looking for the freedom, peace and hope that this world cannot give. For them effective street witnessing may open the way to Kingdom blessings now. Other observers include haters of true worship, who deride and condemn God’s servants. To them proper street ministry may bring no blessing, but a marking as “goats”. Whatever the result to humans, the name of Jehovah is magnified, and his purpose served.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Appearance</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To be effective, both the “silent” and the “vocal” witness of the publisher must reflect his being God’s servant. Jehovah is a God of cleanness ; hence his servants must be clean. Clean magazine bags neatly placed, clean clothing and clean magazines, combined with proper stance (not leaning against a building or pole) and a pleasant and courageous disposition will, though not a word is spoken, give an effective “silent” witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Oral Testimony</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The tongue must come into play, however, for all who can speak. How can your “vocal” witness best serve Jehovah’s purpose? Do you call out appropriate slogans in an inviting, friendly way? Do you take the initiative, approach those near by and ask, &quot;Have you read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> lately?” then deliver a brief witness? Do you use your voice for public witnessing, or to instruct new ones, rather than to discuss the problems of the day with other publishers? If “Yes”, your “vocal” street witness is certain to be effective, whether you place many magazines or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since more copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> are now obtainable, while the supply of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font2"> is still limited, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> can be stressed in street work. Current issues of both magazines may be displayed simultaneously ; if the supply of one is exhausted, however, use the other. Appropriate slogans, pointed and edifying, will rouse interest. These may apply to any issue, or high-light contents of current magazines. Suggested slogans may be briefly offered during the service meetings by the advertising servant or the company servant. These servants will consider each issue beforehand and form a few current slogans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Street handbill service is giving a tremendous witness. Where sufficient publishers are on hand, it is believed best that some do magazine work and others, who might wear magazine bags or placards, if available, distribute handbills. If handbills are not “going”, ask passers-by, “Have you received your invitation to the public Bible talk?” and many who have not will accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Effective street witnessing, all features of it, will glorify Jehovah and draw good-will to the right worship. Work always to this end.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The nations of the earth are in a deep, death-like sleep. Ignorance of the impending disaster at Armageddon shrouds the earth. But piercing through the darkness of this slumbering world comes the rousing call: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Now</span><span class="font2"> it is high time to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">awake.” </span><span class="font2">(Rom. 13 :11) Calling on the nations to awake Is being accomplished by those who are clothed with light, those aware of the Imminent world destruction and mindful of their deliverance, Jehovah’s witnesses. Their message is one of ‘awakening the nations’ to the fact that ‘the night is far spent and the day is at hand’, that now is the time to “cast off the works of darkness” and don the “armour of light”. This urgent work of arousing and awakening is our obligation and privilege during March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Awakening the Nations in March</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">March is the third month of what appears to be the greatest </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign in Theocratic history. Everywhere the brethren have lent their support to this unprecedented subscription campaign. Subscriptions continue to flood the office. At the time this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">went to press we had 82,850 subscriptions, with much mail yet to be opened. In March we shall continue to press the dual subscription offer of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> and the free premium of two bound books, such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True’’, “The Kingdom Is at Hand”,</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”,</span><span class="font2"> on the contribution of two dollars. In every home where it is not possible to obtain a subscription, concentrate on leaving </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font2"> A special effort will be made to visit those whose subscriptions have expired and present this outstanding offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When preparing subscriptions for this office carefully follow all the instructions relative to their handling. An extra moment on your part will save the Society much time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Watchtower” Back-Calls to Awaken Interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is necessary that we be ever mindful of the fact that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> are the most vital magazines in print today. Why? They contain that which means life to their readers. Especially </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> which shines forth in earth’s “night” combating the binding darkness of the world. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> is important to all desiring life; but simply subscribing for it is not sufficient. To benefit from it, one must </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tinderstand</span><span class="font2"> its contents. This means making </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">About two weeks after taking the subscriptions, the publisher should call back for the purpose of making a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> back-call. He should take with him the current issue of the magazine. Go there to really assist the person in understanding</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>mbat World Ignorance</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> refer to the main article, discuss several paragraphs, demonstrate and stress its necessity in Bible study. By making such calls regularly, interest will be quickened. Thus by continually watering the “seed”, it will eventually bear fruit, becoming a home </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study. Subscribers will soon recognize the desirability of studying basic Bible doctrines, as well. These are contained in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font2"> Put forth every effort to promote a book study with both </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscribers and non-subscribers who obtain this easily-understood book. Make </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> back-calls; conduct </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus, having possession of the “only light”, which removes the blackness of earth’s “night”, let us go forth fully aware of our privileges, ‘awakening the nations’ in March.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Witness in Rural Territories</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">With many transportation restrictions removed, the opportunity is now available for publishers to expand out Into many rural sections, not properly worked for several years. Provided with new literature and with arrangements for public talks, all brethren should rejoice in the possibilities of extending to the people living in these areas the “bread of life”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From June 1 until the end of September of this year, all companies, pioneers and special pioneers will concentrate on working rural territories. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Each company</span><span class="font2"> will complete all its city territory between now and June 1, and prepare rural territory for assignment to car groups. Publishers unable to go into the rurals because of lack of transportation will work in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneers</span><span class="font2"> working with companies who are unable to take an isolated territory will co-operate with the company in working its rurals. Those pioneers who can go out into isolated counties may make application for such territory anytime between now and June 1. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Special pioneers</span><span class="font2"> also may enter this service provided adequate provision can be made to care for studies, back-calls and good-will interest. This can be done by either expanding to rurals immediately adjacent to their present assignment or by one or two remaining and working the present assignment and caring for the goodwill interest. Each special pioneer group should prayerfully consider this matter and write the Society outlining what they as a group can do in participating in this campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">presentation</span><span class="font2"> will be primarily three bound books on a contribution of one dollar. More information relative to this will be given later. The main tiling now is to plan and make necessary preparations.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Greater Coverage of Territory, Increase in Back-Calls Result</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">‘Public meetings to be put on by every company! Theocratically trained speakers to deliver one-hour talks! Intensive advertising to acquaint thousands with truth!’ Acclaimed with delight and enthusiasm was this initial announcement back in December, 1944, of a new feature of service, the public meeting campaign. Through it a tremendous witness has been given earth-wide. Jehovah’s manifest blessing has rested upon the zealous, cooperative efforts of his people in advertising, attending, and bringing good-will persons to the public meetings. An even greater witness will be effected through united servant and publisher support of the rearranged, expanding public meeting program outlined herein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> are enclosed three sets of outlines for the new public talks. Immediately upon receipt, the company servant, assistant company servant, back-call servant and school servant will meet for selection of speakers. Brethren chosen to prepare public talks must be enrolled in the Theocratic ministry school, and be good speakers and active publishers. At least two brethren should be assigned to prepare the same talk, while each speaker should prepare two talks, preferably one of the first four and one of the last four. After selection of speakers the company servant will give the outlines to those chosen. The third set of outlines will be kept in the Theocratic ministry school library. Speakers should prepare prayerfully and thoroughly, and adhere closely to the outline. In smaller companies the same individual may be required to deliver more talks, according to the number of qualified brethren available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Coverage of Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Beginning the week-end of April 5, 6 the working of public meeting territory will be done in manner similar to that outlined in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Organization I nstructions</span><span class="font2"> respecting “Group Witnessing”. Territory selected for coverage by the company will be worked by groups of publishers (or individuals, where not convenient to work with a group). Each group will be assigned sufficient territory to last for the entire series, covering a different portion of its territory each week, using the same literature offer discussed in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> together with handbills. Effort should be made to complete the assignment in four weeks. Through this arrangement much more territory will be worked, and all will be given equal opportunity to obtain literature and attend public talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Special emphasis is to be placed on back-call work. Sometime (luring the week following the public meeting each publisher (or group of publishers) will try to call back on all “not-at-homes” in the section already covered. Here the complete literature offer will be presented, together with a handbill. Also, back-calls will be made on those w ho manifested in-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Expands</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">terest or accepted literature when the territory was worked. With these a handbill inviting them to the next public talk will be left, and an endeavor put forth to stir greater interest In the literature placed on the initial call. This procedure will be followed each week, calling on “not-at-homes” and interested ones in the previously-worked sections of the territory. Thus, a personal publisher invitation to attend all four talks will be given to each person of good-will and “not-at-homes” will be cared for. On the week-end the group will move into another section of territory and work from house to house. Back-calls or “not-at-homes” not cared for during the week can be attended to after door-to-door work prior to the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In small, outlying towns complete coverage of territory might be made in one week. Publishers may expand into the rural area surrounding the town the remaining weeks of the series, concentrating at the same time on back-calls and “notat-homes” In the town. There is no objection, however, to covering the same area four times, if territory is limited. The publisher has a different handbill to present each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is believed best that series be limited to four public meetings. Two weeks of concerted hack-call service in the entire section covered can follow a four-week series, with stress laid on starting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font2">studies. A different portion of territory can then be covered in the same manner, with the other four public talks being given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">House to House Record; Other Items</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The House to House Record should be used by each publisher in public meeting and other house-to-house work. If some find little advantage in keeping a record of where no interest is shown, they may dispense with this entry. Rather, use the form primarily to note literature placements, interest, and “notat-homes”. It is this data that is needed in attending to the vital back-call work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study may be held, following a brief intermission, after the public meeting, with goodwill invited to remain. When the meeting is put on in a hall other than the Kingdom Hall, holding the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study in that hall will depend upon its accessibility to all the brethren. Advance announcement of any change in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">study meeting-place should be made. In most instances it may be advisable to return to the Kingdom Hall for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study. This, however, as well as the time of the study, will be determined locally, with the advancement of Kingdom interests in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies will arrange to distribute an appropriate booklet (different one for each talk) following the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Publishers and servants, by working shoulder to shoulder with one another and persons of good-will in the above-outlined public meeting activity, will unquestionably effect a greater expansion of the Kingdom witness in their territory.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Shining in the Kingdom” Testimony Period </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Activity, Start of New Public Meetings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Four-Month Subscription Campaign Climaxed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak in Publishers Expected</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To be alive in 1947 is a wonderful privilege! The harvest, the end of the world, has come. Immovably entrenched as earth’s rightful Judge and King is the “Sower&quot; of the “good seed”, Christ Jesus. Cast down from heaven is that wicked tare-producing “enemy”, Satan the Devil. Gathered out from among the faithful “wheat class” and bundled for burning are the despondent, sickened “tares” who ‘weep and gnash their teeth’ in demonic, malicious rage against God’s approved servants. Ignoring them, the “wheat class” press on with increasing brilliance in Jehovah’s glorious service, ‘shining as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.’ (Matt. 13 : 43) Joining in are faith-keeping “other sheep”. In perfect accord they and the remnant serve as Kingdom lightbearers to the nations in this “time of the end”, before the rapidly-approaching </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">telos,</span><span class="font2"> or final end, of this degenerate system of things. It is a grand privilege indeed for all Kingdom publishers and those of good-will to be able to reflect during April the light of Jehovah and his King, by sharing in the multifeatured “Shining in the Kingdom” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Memorial Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The outstanding feature of April's work is the Memorial celebration, with the special April 5, 6 week-end activity. It will start a tremendous, world-wide witness during April. House-to-house and street territory should be lined up for this campaign. Back-call names should be in order for inviting all good-will to the public meeting and Memorial. A diligent, concerted effort is to be made by servants and publishers to contact all irregular publishers, inactive ones and persons of good-will and assist these to have some part in Memorial week-end service. The offer at the doors will be the joint subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> for $2.00, and two books given free, one to be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font2"> On the streets magazines will be offered. In all features handbill advertising by every company of the first public talk of the new series, “Announcing the Perfect Government,” will be carried on. Memorial week-end will be an excellent opportunity to get good-will persons started in the service, if only by distributing hand-bills advertising the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With intensive witnessing Saturday and Sunday, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">study Saturday evening, followed by a service talk on summer rural work, Sunday’s public talk, and all this heightened by the Memorial observance, the pace will be set for continually increasing activity throughout the year. Be certain to arrange for new interest to attend both the enlightening public talk and the significant Memorial service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An outline for the Memorial celebration is sent to all companies with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> A competent brother chosen to give the Memorial talk will use the outline in preparing it. Afterwards the outline is to be kept in the Theocratic ministry library for future reference. If no competent brother is available, suitable paragraphs may be read from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The special “Memorial Activity” report card sent with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> is to be filled out completely and maileil following the Sunday evening service. It provides for recording public talk attendance, num-her partaking of emblems, and attendance at Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">April Climaxes Subscription Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a result of zealous service during Memorial week-end. increases in all features should be manifest throughout the month. April will undoubtedly be the biggest month yet for subscriptions, climaxing the campaign. In addition to house-to-house subscription work, special attention will be given to calling on .all who subscribed last year and failed to renew. To facilitate this the Society will send to all companies subscription expiration back-call slips for subscriptions that expired in January and February. Be sure to call. Try to arouse their interest in resubscribing. These will be “new” subscriptions, contributing toward the highest number obtained in any campaign thus far. Since these slips are run early this year, it may be that many have already renewed their subscriptions. In this event, call to find out if magazines are being received, and endeavor to increase interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Also, publishers will be alert to make return calls on all new subscribers, helping them to the greatest extent possible to understand God’s purposes through home </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The benefits of public meeting work will be greatly enhanced by the new talks and the expanded method of working territory. Give public meetings constant attention. Follow up interest, and strive to build up from your April 6 attendance. Keep these persons coming to the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">All-Time Peak in Publishers</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">by distributing handbills. No matter ' Companies needing booklets should how small the effort, it will <sub>con</sub>.; check with near-by companies who - । may have surplus supplies, and oh-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">With everyone working diligently and regularly in the features aboveoutlined, April will assuredly witness an all-time peak in the number of persons ‘letting the Kingdom light shine’. Every publisher should plan to be active. Every effort should be exerted to interest good-will persons in accompanying you in some feature of the work. Show them how we preach the gospel. Let them share in this blessed service, even if only tribute toward expansion, and should be much appreciated. New publishers that start in April will be richly blessed, and should continue regularly thereafter, proving their love for God by active works of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is encouraging to note that November, December and January past have been marked by the greatest number of publishers in the field for these months in history. By Jehovah’s grace and our efforts to expand we can continue to make each succeeding month the best to date. And April, 1047, with its Memorial week-end activity, new public talks with expanded territory- coverage, servant to the brethren work, circuit assemblies, and emphasis laid on taking newly interested ones into the field, together with improved weather conditions, should prove to be one of the greatest single months of Kingdom witnessing on record. Let's work together toward accomplishment of this aim. Jehovah's rich blessing will surely be in evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yes, the day in which we live is truly significant in human history, for it is tioit’ when the name of the Most High must be vindicated and multitudes be made acquainted with the one way- to life. Shine forth, then, servants of the King eternal, and reflect for the healing of the &quot;nations” the light of truth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Pioneers by April 1</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Enlist as Full-Time Servants in the Great Spring Offensive</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The army of the Lord is now on the offensive in an extensive worldwide truth-proclaiming campaign. The spring onslaught has been mapped out for us as follows: the greatest subscription campaign to date, greatly increased public meeting activity, extensive home studies for feeding the Lord's other sheep, and wholehearted support of the present circuit arrangement and assemblies. The visible organization of Jehovah now closely knit together in the bonds of peace and unity has responded to these blessed privileges with increased zeal and energy and the way is now wide open for thousands to throw their weight into the fray as full-time pioneers in the army of the Lord. By just a little extra effort and arranging, many now zealously serving as company publishers can increase their scope of activity and enroll as pioneers by April 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Respond to the Call</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Letters are now being sent to all companies to stimulate to pioneer service all those who are able. As these letters are considered in the company meetings, respond to and apply the admonition therein contained. Take up full-time activity as preachers of the Kingdom gospel. Join in the ever-increasing offensive against darkness and error, not by a few hours a month, but by a whole, full life dedicated and used to Jehovah’s praise. Now is the time to plan for summer activity also. School students should now start considering and planning on serving as vacation pioneers, so that by summer every one that possibly can will be in that joyful army of full-time servants. Be a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare for May Booklet Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a follow-up of the four-month </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> subscription campaign, the month of May-will be devoted exclusively to booklet work, the offer being 7 booklets on a contribution of 25c or 3 on a 10c contribution. Combinations should be made up from the booklets the companies have in stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tain such from them. Arrangements can be helped in some instances by the servant to the brethren and through circuit assemblies. Start checking now so as to have adequate booklet supplies for the May campaign. Booklets may be ordered from the Society in harmony with instructions contained in Brother Knorr's letter appearing in the January </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Servants Moving</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If a company servant finds it necessary to leave the company's territory, he should make arrange-। ments </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font2"> departing, for the receiving and proper handling of Society mail for the company. The Society should be advised if mail is to be sent to the assistant company servant, anil full name and address of the assistant furnished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If the departure is permanent, or if for some reason another servant needs to be appointed in any- capacity. the company committee should i meet and submit recommendations for servants. Complete information must be supplied, as requested in paragraph (50 of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The complete name of company and/or unit should appear at the top of all company correspondence.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Written Reviews</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">School of Theocratic Ministry Made More</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Effective</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many are the expressions of appreciation the Society is receiving from the companies throughout the land for the added feature of the written reviews, for both brothers and sisters, in the study of the Bible handbook </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”</span><span class="font2"> at the Theocratic ministry school. And they have good reason to rejoice. The members of the Bethel family have been taking these reviews on the Bible and handbook for about six months now and each one participating can testify to receiving great benefit from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, with these reviews as with everything else, it is true that the more you put into a thing, the more you will get out of it. The more you apply yourself, the more effort y-ou put into this by Individual study and regular, alert and active attendance at the school, the more you will get out of it in the way of Theocratic equipment and joy. Therefore let all carefully study their lessons at home, attend the school each week and take part in the discussions, and then take the written review.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It will be to each one’s benefit to take the written review every time, even though at times he may- not feel fully prepared. Regardless of the amount of preparation you may have been able to make, concentrating on the questions will help impress them on your mind, and when you hear the correct answers given at the end of the review you will remember them all the longer, thus proving a valuable aid in equipping you for your field ministry. And, after all, that is the reason for the entire course, including the written reviews: that you may be perfectly “equipped for every good work”. Let each one therefore do his best, make full use of this provision of the Lord, and rejoice in it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">A proper handling of a funeral service provides an excellent opportunity to magnify the name and purposes of Jehovah and to comfort those that mourn. This service should be a clear presentation of the truth concerning the origin of man and his destiny. These occasions should not be used as a means to eulogize creatures or to vilify- and denounce men and organizations. Be tactful and considerate of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To aid in a uniform presentation and an appropriate witness, the Society is sending to each company- an outline for a funeral discourse, and recommends its use by brethren requested to conduct such services. One or more competent brothers in each company should prepare a good funeral discourse so as to be prepared for any such emergency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The outline should be kept in the Theocratic ministry library and be available to the brethren who wish to use it. Isolated brethren not associated with a company may- obtain a copy of this outline by written request to the Society.</span></p>

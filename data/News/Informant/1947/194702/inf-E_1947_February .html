</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>All of Jehovah’s Servants Eager to Uphold His Truthfulness</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Soon the issue of truth versus error will be settled forever with a smashing victory for truth. Jehovah the God of all truth will vindicate himself and all those who have stood for his truthfulness. Those who have been deceived by the lies of God's enemies will be confounded, but those who have been faithful in the proclamation of God's Word as truth will be justified with him, and, additionally, they have the blessed assurance that they will share Jehovah’s ultimate triumph. (See Romans 3: 4, our service text for February.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The privilege of sharing in this glorious fight is not a future matter, something that can be put off or attended to whenever we “feel like it&quot;. Right now is the time to vigorously defend God’s truthfulness, and during February those who really see and appreciate the issue will have an active part in the present mighty </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Present the Full Offer of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Subscriptions and 2 Bound Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Early reports show that the two-magazine subscription offer of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> is being accepted very readily. Subscriptions for most magazines are very expensive these days, but when a year’s subscription for two valuable magazines is presented at the very nominal sum of $2.00, and two truth-packed books, such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;, “The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Tree&quot;,</span><span class="font3"> given free as a premium, people can easily see that it is not a commercial scheme. Thus the publisher has the opportunity of showing that it is actually part of the free educational program that Jehovah is conducting throughout the earth to point men to the highway of life. So do not feel that you cannot place the offer. I'resent it with enthusiasm, and you will be surprised at the results. Where a subscription cannot be obtained, always endeavor to leave the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font3"> so that the way may be paved for holding a book study in the house of those accepting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow-up of Interest Will Bring Big Increase in Back-Call and Book-Study Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The need of aiding those who obtain </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> to understand its contents is clearly manifest. It is not a story magazine, to be skimmed through lightly. Understanding of its conients requires diligent study and, in many cases, assistance by those who know God’s truthfulness. Just as Philip willingly explained Isaiah's prophecy to the Ethiopian, so Jehovah's Christian witnesses will gladly aid the “other sheep” by arranging home studies in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font3"> as outlined In the January </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Through this means thousands more studies will be started and back-call activity will increase. The distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> is laying the foundation for a tremendous educational program. Shortage of publishing material may in time affect the quantity of literature we have to offer, but the need for personal study and application of the truths learned will actually increase as other conditions in the earth become worse. Be zealous in assisting these new students to become associated with God’s people in joining the efforts to uphold his truthfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Share in Attaining the Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A quota of 200,000 subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and 100,000 subscriptions for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazine has been established for all the publishers throughout the earth. Without dividing this amount proportionately between the various countries, we will all diligently strive to do our full share, trusting in the Lord as to the result. If the company has territory not worked with the subscription offer in recent years, special effort should be put forth to see that all such territory is covered during the present </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Keep the present offer foremost in every feature of Kingdom activity, at the doors, on the streets, to acquaintances, on back-calls, at studies; wherever you are, try to get people interested in having both </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> come to their home in weekly magazine service. Above all, look well to the spiritual needs of all those who are searching for truth. Feed them by establishing home studies, and go farther by extending the welcome hand for them to come and join you in maintaining Jehovah’s true worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The 1947 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's witnesses</span><span class="font3"> not only gives eloquent testimony to the great expansion work being carried on in all parts of the earth, but also reveals that there is a tremendous work yet to be done. That each Kingdom publisher may have a still greater part in tiiis expansion work the Lord has provided the Bible h a u d b o o k </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”. </span><span class="font3">And so that all may get the greatest possible benefit from the study of this new instrument arrangements have been made for written reviews. For the first twenty lessons of the book the following procedure will be used.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Circuit Assemblies to Stimulate Further Progress</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Topping off a year of expanding praise to Jehovah, the highest number of company publishers ever reporting, 66,210, together with thousands of pioneers, united in extending gladness to the nations. Most remarkable is the fact that over 12,000 more publishers were active in service during December, 1946, than during December a year ago! A total of 69,876 publishers shared in the work. What a fitting manifestation of the Lord’s blessing upon our inviting “nations” of goodwill to “be glad, with his people” ! We have real reason to rejoice and press forward with increased de</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">termination to expand in Kingdom i preaching during 1947. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To what may this manifest bless- । ing of our God be attributed? Na- ’ tion-wide, servants in companies industriously planned and put into effect arrangements to aid new and weak publishers to see and taste the gladness of serving Jehovah. Simultaneously, 144 servants to the brethren, and in many cases their wives, spending one week with each company, large and small, gave practical assistance </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">in field publishing</span><span class="font3"> to hundreds of irregular publishers, ‘inactive’ and other goodwill persons, in addition to those publishing each month. The newly arranged servant to the brethren activity with its emphasis on field publishing has the evident favor of the Lord, and will continue to stimulate many to better and more Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mainly responsible for the new high in company publishers, however, is the support and wholehearted effort given to the field during the “Nations’ Gladness&quot; Testimony Period by the individual publisher. It was you, the publisher, who faced inclement weather and other obstacles to go from house to house, preaching the good news. It was the individual publisher who made back-calls and carried on book studies, and then took such interested persons into the field that j they might make others glad by active service. And this concerted,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Beginning with March 9, a new schedule of student speaking assignments will go into effect. Copies of it are being sent to companies with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> and one is to ; be given to each pioneer and com- j pany publisher attending the school. ', This will replace the previous sched- <sup>1 </sup>ule, which should be discarded so I as not to cause any confusion. In j this new schedule subjects are listed for the first and third speaker of the evening. The second speaker | will choose his own subject. This <sup>1 </sup>may be on some magazine article '</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">determined endeavor of hundreds of publishers has had its effect in the attainment of an all-time high, with increased praise to Jehovah. The new interest who have begun to publish will need attention during the months to come. Let's give it to them regularly and unite toward further increase while inviting, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Circuit Assemblies to Forward Expansion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Contributing to further expansion are the circuit assemblies, which started country-wide January 3-5. Enthusiasm runs higli over these assemblies, where the same spirit of {gladness and unity prevails as did at Cleveland. Publishers show keen interest in the activity of other companies and the circuit as a whole and are alert to suggestions for improving various features of the service locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The well-planned service meeting and Theocratic ministry school have proved instructive to all. The extensively advertised public talk “Blessed Are the Peacemakers'’ has been attended by hundreds of responsive strangers. But Saturday evening's circuit activity meeting takes first place as the assembly's most outstanding feature. In Florida, Michigan, Washington, D. C., Iowa, Tennessee and New Mexico fishermen, miners, lumbermen, farmers, factory laborers, business and professional men, housewives, and pioneers, brethren from all walks of life, united to discuss the common problem of vital concern to all: Kingdom interest in their circuit. They wanted to talk over and compare their problems with others, to discuss local activity in an informal, Theocratic manner, to offer suggestions for consideration. And this they have done, to the delight and edification of all assembled. Moreover, many made notes of the constructive counsel from the district servant and have been moved to expend greater effort during the next six months to magnify Jehovah's name as one indissoluble people. Much practical aid and a real blessing were missed by some few weak companies by not being represented. These assemblies are espe-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">cially designed to assist such. The resulting benefits should motivate every company to be fully represented at every assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The individual publisher's effort, the servant to the brethren work, and now the circuit assemblies, are all receiving Jehovah's rich blessing. Let each one give thanks to Jehovah and be moved to greater service m'tiv ity during the coming year, so that ever-increasing praise from all nations will be given to Jehovah.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">The one giving talk should use the method (if at all able to do so), being careful to high-light the main points as noted by the questions appearing in tlie handbook at the end of each lesson. In fact, everyone attending the school should be careful to note the main points when studying the lesson beforehand. Having these main points thus impressed on one’s mind will prove very helpful in the oral review of the lesson the following week as well as in the written review later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Written Review Procedure</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every fifth week, instead of oral review, instruction talk and student talks, there will be a written review on tlie material covered in the previous four lessons. (’The oral review on tlie last instruction talk before the written review will be held the week after the written review. 1 This will be a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">closed hook</span><span class="font3"> review, which means that the students will not be permitted to consult any notes, the Bible or the textbook. It will consist of some twenty-five questions printed on a form provided by the Society and will also have space for tlie writing in of the answers. A copy for eacli one attending tlie school as well as a set of answers for the school servant will be sent a month in advance to tlie school servant in care of the company servant. These questions are to be strictly confidential until the time of the review, and no one but the school servant should have access to tlie answer sheet until after the review has been held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A halt’ hour will be allowed for the written review, after which the papers will be collected by the school servant. He will then read to tlie class tlie questions and the correct answers. During the following week he will grade the papers, and will return them at the next school session, at which time he will also give a report on the results of tlie review, tlie number participating therein, the tn erage grade, the liigh-and wait longer before acting. Nations must be awakened to the facts. They must learn that &quot;the night is far spent, the day is at hand”. Yes, millions must be awakened by the spread of God's truth to “cast off the works of darkness&quot; and &quot;put on the armour of light”. It is the one way to escape permanent death and live in the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That is why the Lord is directing us to present to all peoples during March the two-subscription offer of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!—</span><span class="font3">the only magazines capable of arousing many in this sleeping world. Irregular publishers, inactive ones, people of good-will, why hold off longer from serving as active, vigilant publishers of tlie Kingdom? Share with your brethren in &quot;awakening the nations&quot; during March by being alert in tlie field, from house to house, on back-calls and in street work, with those you know who are not in the truth, and with your employer. Avake to every opportunity to speak truth, using </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> Diligent j publisher action earth-wide during I March will accomplish an effective est mark, and any other outstanding points of interest regarding the review.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bible</span><span class="font3"> covered in the lesson for the evening.

<p><span class="font3">The student talks will be limited Io the actual contents of the chapters within the assignments, and no reference should be made to what a previous speaker may have said or a subsequent speaker may have to say regarding other parts of the book under discussion. Each student talk on a Bible book should be complete in itself, having an introduction, body and conclusion as well as a well-developed theme. Time will not permit going into the fulfillment of prophecies or the prophetic significance of the various dramas, and, therefore, if touched upon, it should only be incidental. As indicated on the new schedule, tlie number of chapters to be covered by each student will depend upon the number of student speakers. Where there is only one. he may pick out some prominent event of the Bible book and highlight it in his presentation, or, if he wishes, he may take some Tlieo-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To Jehovah’s people earth-wide the celebration of the memorial of our Lord’s death is the most significant event of each year. It is the one celebration yet binding upon the Lord's people, and has been enhanced since the second advent of the Lord and his coming to the temple. Jehovah’s anointed witnesses and their companions in every company or unit will assemble lo-' rally to observe the Memorial, Sun-| day evening, April 6.

This is to be put into effect by every company in the world. Saturday, April 5, should be marked by allday house-to-house witnessing and advertising of Sunday's public talk. There will be no circuit assemblies held this week-end: each company or unit will organize for service locally. Many newly interested persons may express their appreciation by distributing handbills. That evening everyone will assemble for study of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> the issue scheduled for study the following day.

A good reader should be assigned to read this letter at the first service meeting and first </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study after it has been received. Then </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> capable brother should be assigned to carefully study this letter and prepare to consider it for twenty minutes at a service meeting during the month. Following this, the letter is to be posted on the bulletin board, fastening only one side, so that the brethren individually may read the entire letter. Every servant of the Lord should carefully and prayerfully consider its contents.</span></p>

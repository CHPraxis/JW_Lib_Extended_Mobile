<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Dear Publishers of the Kingdom:</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> for 1947 shows us how wonderfully Jehovah has blessed His people during years of war and strife. His blessing fell upon His people because they were obedient to His commands and they loved peace. It can certainly be said, “Blessed are the peacemakers.” With unity and peace reigning in the Lord's organization, an even greater witness will be given, by the Lord’s grace, and this before the final battle of Armageddon. Since the war the question is asked: How can conditions in the various countries get any better? They seem to be getting worse. We know that selfishness will reign as long as the Devil remains the god of this old world. But this condition does not dishearten the peacemakers who are blessed of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses know trying times, and fully appreciating their commission they have moved forward and will continue to move forward, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom in all the world for a witness. Trying times have never slowed down Jehovah’s witnesses!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seeing the distress on every hand and in every nation, many persons have made inquiry as to how the pioneers can continue in the field under the difficult times and high cost of living. Theirs is a problem. All persons associated with the Society know that the pioneers obtain their<sup>-</sup> literature much below the cost of production. In fact, the charge made to pioneers is nominal, but with the cost of living necessities skyrocketing, especially since controls have been taken off, one truly wonders how they get along with the margin of contributions they receive from literature. Most of them do not. The cost of everything has risen: newspapers, magazines, food, clothing, traveling, etc., and still the Society’s publications are offered to the people on the same contributions as before the war. How is this possible? Only because of the contributions you have made to the Good Hopes fund of the Society. Primary consideration, however, should be given to the pioneers, their cost of living and their welfare; secondarily, consideration should be given to the cost of materials that are purchased for the manufacture of books, booklets and magazines used by the pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let us consider for a moment the pioneer’s cost of living. He must pay 50 to 60 percent more for food now than in 1938, and his income is no greater. The cost of clothes and of shoes has increased 75 percent since before the war. Accommodations are hard to find; traveling is more expensive. Would it not be well, then, for the pioneers to ask more in the way of contributions for the literature that is placed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Secondarily, the cost of operation on the part of the Society in the manufacture of publications has increased tremendously, especially since the lifting of the OPA regulations. Newsprint, which is used in the publication of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine and the booklets, has risen 98 percent since before the war. The paper used in books and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">magazine has gone up 60 percent. Cloth used for covering books, 123 percent ; fuel oil has risen 71 percent; coal, 67 percent; cartons used for shipping literature have gone up in price 100 percent; wrapping paper, 127 percent. All other materials used in the production of books, booklets and magazines have risen anywhere from 25 percent to 150 percent. In view of these facts, it seems advisable for the Society, through its publishers in the held, to ask for a higher contribution on the bound books only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CHANGE IN CONTRIBUTION. Beginning May 1, 1947, the bound books will be offered to the people on a contribution of 35c; or three bound volumes for $1.00. The Society will not change the contribution asked for booklets, namely, 5c a copy, or 3 booklets on a contribution of 10c, or 7 on a contribution of 25c, using in these combinations of 3 one colored-cover booklet, one 64-page self-covered booklet, and one 32-page booklet, or, if the publisher chooses, any three booklets on a contribution of 10c. The year's subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Atcake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine will remain the same, namely, $1.00.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">COMPANY RATE ADJUSTMENT. The Society feels sure that with an adjustment on the company rate to publishers and the Good Hopes donations which the brethren everywhere have been sending in to the Society, it will make it possible for us to hold the rates on all publications where they are now with the exception of bound books and continue to maintain the same pioneer rates on all publications to pioneers. By increasing the rate to company publishers in proportion to the publicrate on bound books, and making a slight increase on booklets and magazines to company publishers, we feel sure the Society will lie able to meet all of its expenses on production and at the same time be able to place the publications with the pioneers at much below cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society will publish a new cost list on all English and foreign publications within the next two months, so that on April 1, throughout the world and in all languages, the new rates will go into effect as they pertain to companies and with a few slight changes affecting pioneers. The change of rate on bound books will go into effect May 1 as it affects the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All orders received in the Brooklyn office or at any Branch office after April 1 will take the new charge on the company invoices as set out next. This applies both to English and to other-language publications.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Keep “Unspotted for Service of Praise”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Theocratic weekly magazine serv-‘ ice 1 That is the key theme of the two-magazine subscription offer starting January. Joint subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Atcake! </span><span class="font4">makes available a continued weekly flow of life-giving truth, not only to the subscriber himself, but to every member of the family. This is the first time a combination stressing weekly magazine service has been arranged. It should be presented to every person at every door in the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Make no mistake. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> offer more than just “magazine service”. The world is full of that. Their magazines glorify theories of selfish men. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> are strictly Theocratic. With its truth-telling, fearless message </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4"><sup>:</sup> takes the lead in the field of Bible instruction, pointing to the God-created Messianic kingdom. And its companion </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Atcake!</span><span class="font4"> Not an alarmist, but a magazine digging below the surface of events and things to open the reader's eyes to what is kept hidden from a drowsy world by selfish forces. These two watchful companions give a weekly service of vital instruction and news throughout the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the person at the door is not in position to obtain the $2.00 joint subscription, then stress should be placed upon the all-important Bible instruction contained in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> which makes it the most important magazine of the day. Wherever possible the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> should be one of the two premium books that are to be left with every joint subscription and the people encouraged to study it. However, if it is not available, press forward with whatever literature is on hand, arranging for other suitable combinations where a subscription cannot be placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“All Nations” Subscription Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As those from all nations praise Jehovah, this subscription campaign is extended to every land with a message in every tongue. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is now available twice a month in Afrikaans, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Hollandish, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish. It is published once a month in Portuguese, Greek, Italian, Polish, Russian, Slovak and Ukrainian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are pleased to announce that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> is now published in a Spanish edition of 32 pages, two-color, just like the English, except that it is published once a month. The Greek. Ukrainian and Portuguese editions are published in a 16-page one-color magazine, once a month. This should indeed add stimulus to the campaign. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Connotation</span><span class="font4"> is now available in Afrikaans, Danish, French, Hollandish and Swedish</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">once a month, and twice a month in German.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The subscription rate for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Atcake!</span><span class="font4"> (or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation}</span><span class="font4"> in any language, either monthly or semimonthly, in the United States is $1.00 per year. Company publishers need remit only 75c for each subscription during campaigns where a book is given. The pioneer rate for all subscriptions is now the same as for the English </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Keeping Unspotted</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is ample opportunity for the publisher to engage in the “service of praise”, and plenty of literature with which to work. Utilize every feature of the work and every instrument for this international praise. Back issues of magazines should be used in conjunction with the subscription offer. Coupled with all this we have the finest instrument for the service of praise available, namely, the God-given, Theocratically-guided human voice. It is with the voice that we convey our convictions. The witness at the door, on the streets or in the homes should press forward ‘unspotted for the service of praise’ utilizing his knowledge and voice to spread out the cry “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations”. __________</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Calendar</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 1947 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> and Calendar graphically describe Theocratic expansion and reconstruction in all nations. The Calendar, in pictures, carries you from one Branch office to another, each reflecting the atmosphere of the country it represents. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> describes the Kingdom activity carried on in these lands, and puts meat, power and life into the imaginative picture awakened by the Calendar. It reveals the work's progress despite rain, heat or cold; its expansion despite devilish opposition. In lands where the truth had barely been mentioned in times past, today there exists a living, working organization of God’s people. As you read, you visualize our brethren earth-wide standing fast for the Kingdom, and being moved to action in this year of 1947 by the stirring yeartext, “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> contains stimulating experiences that will fit any condition. Our brethren elsewhere are meeting and overcoming problems similar<sup>-</sup> to ours. Consider these experiences at service meetings, and let them help you meet the issue in your territory. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> should be used during the entire year as a source for inspiring service-meeting material. The Calendar also deserves consideration at a service meeting, with attention given to the testimony periods and alternate months' activities. Appreciation for the publishers' part in the reconstruction and expansion work will be deepened through this means.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Truth-spreading </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Campaign Continues</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Two billion copies, in l,0G8 languages 1 That is the amazing record piled up by God's Book of truthfulness. Despite this, millions discount the Bible as unauthoritative. They still hold to religion's tradition, and thus give the truth to Satan. Jehovah’s witnesses, however, refuse to deny God the truth. They follow faithfully the clear-cut path of Jesus, who said “Thy word is truth”, and point to Paul’s admonition at Romans 3: 4, “Let God be true, but every man a liar.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During February the Lord's servants will continue to offer the foremost truth-upholding magazines published, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> in combination at each door. To present the magazines effectively, the publisher must be filled with a burning appreciation of their worth. It is God’s truthfulness that is bound up in their pages, Scriptural truthfulness, that makes one strong in faith and brings free</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Quota for Country</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Beginning with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font4">January, 1947, the monthly field service report will correspond with that appearing on all company charts. The quota for publishers is a ten-percent increase over the averages of the previous year. All quotas of hours, back-calls and book studies should be considered as a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">minimum, </span><span class="font4">to be exceeded by the individual publisher to the extent that strength and opportunities permit. By means of this report all will be able to make the same comparisons for the country as a whole as are made for the individual company.</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">dom and peace. First the publisher himself should study unfailingly each issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> and experience the deep-rooted satisfaction that comes with a perusal of its pages. Then carry </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> into the field. Combine a pleasant approach, earnestness, kindness and enthusiasm with a well-prepared presentation, look to Jehovah for guidance, and subscriptions from those who seek truth will be forthcoming. Each campaign has been more successful than the one preceding; and this is positive evidence of the Lord's direction upon </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">public</span><span class="font4"> distribution of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A further requirement, however, during February and succeeding months is that of calling back on each subscriber. The “sheep” need to be fed. Their </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> must be read and understood. Show your love for the Lord and “your neighbor as yourself” through continual return calls, and be a blessing to those who hunger for God’s truthfulness.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Vital to a Successful Subscription Campaign</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Thousands of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions will lie obtained in the next few months. Unless </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is read, however, its regular visits will not benefit the subscriber. The vital need exists for the publisher to call back and make the witness fruitful by encouraging study of the contents of this most important Bible magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Within two weeks following the obtaining of each subscription the publisher should call back and leave the current issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Wherever possible such back-calls should be made by the publisher who obtained the subscription. Using a copy of a recent </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and being familiar with its contents, briefly direct their attention to the leading article, showing the caption text and the development of the material supported by Bible quotations and citations. Demonstrate the use of the questions and other features showing what an invaluable aid </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">is in Bible study. If possible, consider several paragraphs on this initial back-call. Attention might also be given to the secondary articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Home “Watchtower” Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Express your desire to call back on them, and, of course, continue to do so even though immediate interest is not manifest. Each time you call give consideration to a few paragraphs of the recent magazine and where interest is sufficiently developed arrange to conduct a study in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> if they are not yet in position to attend</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">the regular company study. This may be counted as a back-call study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The starting of home </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">studies, however, is not intended to detract from the need and importance of book studies. Rather, the consideration of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">will undoubtedly show to the subscriber his great need of study of the basic Bible doctrines as are so clearly presented in the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“I.ct (tod Ue True”</span><span class="font4"> and others. Every effort will be put forth to get a study started in the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Where circumstances warrant it will lie proper to have a study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> with a person of good-will as well as a book study. These studies may both be held on one evening or at different times during the week, according to the desire of the interested person. In either instance, it would be counted as one home study and the entire time required to conduct such will be counted. If both meetings are held the same evening, only one back-call is to be reported. However, if they are held on different evenings, two back-calls may be reported but only one Study Conductor’s Report filled out covering both meetings of that one &quot;home Bible study”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By diligently following through with this arrangement more effective feeding of the persons of goodwill will result and they will become strengthened to the point of associating with the organization and its activity. Keep in mind that the value of the printed page exists only as the intelligent creature fully grasps its contents. Help the subscribers to understand the contents of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>

It is hoped that we have about reached the peak in this spiral rise of the cost of materials and that no further adjustments will have to be made for some time to come. The general opinion is that prices will never return to what they were before the second World War in any of the countries.</span></p>

Another matter I should bring to your attention is that pertaining to the newsprint paper supply that we use for the publication of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> and booklets. Here in the United States the newspapers have long-term contracts with the paper mills, and they are able to get unlimited supplies or take up the entire production of a paper mill, regardless of what other customers a paper mill may have. During the war, when OPA ruled and governed the size of newspapers, it was quite easy for the Society to get its allotment of paper each year with the aid of governmental regulations. Now, with the OPA rulings off, the newspapers have selfishly taken up all the paper produced by the paper mills; and it is almost impossible to get any newsprint paper for our booklets and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> publication. It has been decided that in the Brooklyn factory we will immediately cease printing booklets and conserve all our paper for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine. If we find that we are able to get some extra quantity during 1947, what little we are able to get over our needs for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> we shall use for printing foreign-language booklets to ship to countries where there is a great scarcity of booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PUBLICATIONS. In checking over the inventories of all the companies and pioneers, which inventories were sent in to the Society at the close of the service year, it is found that there are approximately 900,000 bound books in the hands of the companies and pioneers, and upward of 20,000,000 booklets. With this large storage supply on hand company publishers and pioneers should be able to have sufficient booklets for their field work. If companies run short or pioneers do not have sufficient supplies of booklets, you should order from the Society a quantity of booklets, but do not specify which kind. The Society will send to you an assortment of booklets of what it has on hand. All the company needs to do on its order is to indicate 64-page colored-cover booklets. 64-page self-covered, or 32-page self-covered booklets, and the Society will ship what it has in stock. When we are able to get newsprint paper supplies in sufficient quantities for publishing booklets, announcement will be made through the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font4"> feel sure that the publishers of the Kingdom will be happy to cooperate with the stockkeepers in the various companies and with the Society in this matter of placing such booklets as we have on hand, not slacking their time in the field awaiting new publications, such as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Prince of Peace”, of</span><span class="font4"> which we have printed 2,500,000, but are unable to print any more because of the paper shortage. This may sound very strange in a country like the United States, ‘the land of plenty,’ but we here in Brooklyn have spent much time with paper manufacturers, trying to get our supplies for 1947. You may be assured that your supply of books and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazines will be coming through regularly, because the mills that manufacture the kind of paper used in these publications are supplying us with our requirements for 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ZEAL. When we recall to mind the difficulties our brethren had in many of the countries where bans had been put upon the Society and restrictions raised against importation of literature and how our brethren faithfully carried on under these stressing times, it should make us here in the United States rejoice and be glad to push on just as zealously as our faithful brethren did in other parts of the world during lean years as far as literature was concerned. Never was their spiritual supply shortened or lean, for Jehovah always spread before them a bountiful table. “The Prince of Peace,” who directs his faithful servants from the temple, has looked well to the care of his faithful servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yes, the war is over; but the nations have not crawled out of the terrible mess into which they took themselves, nor will they; for selfish men can never bring peace. It is only within the Lord's organization that we can truthfully say, “Blessed are the peacemakers&quot; ; and we do rejoice that we have such a grand message to carry to the peoples of the earth and with which to comfort them. With the Lord's grace and under the direction of &quot;The Prince of Peace&quot; we will carry forward in this work, preaching the gospel of the Kingdom if we have only the Bible alone. Jehovah, through his organization, has equipped us for every good work and he has made us able ministers so that we can proclaim by word of mouth the truth that will show the people the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1947 is another year for us to advance Kingdom interests, and we invite everyone: “Oh praise Jehovah, all ye nations.” This we joyfully do to the honor and glory of Jehovah's name and the vindication of his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be assured of my love to all of you peacemakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Y’our fellow servant and publisher of the Kingdom,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">, President</span></p>

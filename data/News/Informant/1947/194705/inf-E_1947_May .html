<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>New Publishers Become Better Equipped for Further Service</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah perfectly equips his people to do the work assigned them. He endowed Noah with wisdom, ability and instruction to build an ark. He gave Israel laws and educators to guide them in right worship. He supplied Jesus with his Word and holy spirit, enabling him to prove Satan false and to preach under stress the Kingdom. And today, when Theocratic expansion into earth’s uttermost parts must be effected, and that with rapidity, Jehovah adequately equips his people. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> studies and service meetings, the Theocratic ministry school with its written reviews, servant to the brethren visits and informative circuit assemblies, these are his provisions to make Jehovah's witnesses “complete, perfectly equipped” for expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Expansive Booklet Distribution During May</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Twenty million booklets now lie on stock-room shelves throughout the country. Some are older, others are of more recent publication. Every one, however, shows forth God’s truthfulness and discusses scriptures given ‘for doctrine, reproof and correction’ of men of good-will. Booklets such as these have been stepping-stones to a knowledge of the truth for many who are now readers of this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> These same booklets accomplished a mighty work of expansion in foreign lands, where the latest literature did not enter, during World War II. Recognizing such as effective instruments for world-wide, national and local expansion, company and pioneer publishers will equip themselves with many sets of seven and three booklets, then distribute them extensively throughout their territories. Three for 10c, seven for 25c, will be the contribution rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All companies having either a surplus supply of booklets or insufficient stock should immediately contact all near-by companies and arrange for an equitable distribution of booklets for the Slay campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Showering the nation with waters of truth in booklet form means organized action of all expansionists during May. It means service on week-ends. It means uniting in evening booklet work, with book-study headquarters used, where convenient, as service assembly points. Daytime midweek group witnessing. as well as coverage of individual territory, will further enhance May’s booklet expansion. Housewives, also, may be able to set aside an hour or so afternoons to working near home. Preparation of a concise “booklet witness”, or perhaps two or three, will better equip the publisher for proper introduction as householders open doors. Successful booklet expansion means full usage of Theocratic equipment in co-ordinated action on all fronts, with servants and regular publishers taking the lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Equip New Publishers for Further Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Expansion brings increase in number of gospel-preachers. Off to a good start with handbill distribution during April, new publishers will welcome expansion of individual service in May. Equip new prais-ers of Jehovah with booklets, and personal instruction in door-to-door witnessing. Show love for them through patient, diligent, considerate assistance, regularly. Inactive persons, irregular and new publishers, as well as book-study attendants who appreciate the Kingdom, will respond readily to your friendly service invitations, and become equipped for enlarged Kingdom privileges, as Jehovah’s spirit directs their paths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls and Public Meetings Continue</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May’s booklet expansion will not crowd out our efforts to feed the “sheep”, as back-calls on subscribers, book and booklet obtainers are made. Be “complete” through constant follow-ups. Return calls on last year’s subscribers wTio have permitted regular visits of the world’s most needed periodicals to stop should result in many more subscriptions. Give each expiration slip prompt attention. Bound books will not be given free with subscriptions during May. Be on the alert daily to start </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God He True’’</span><span class="font3"> studies, as a means of equipping good-will persons for perfect service to the true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Multitudes of strangers will hear with rapt interest the truths proclaimed publicly during May and succeeding months, as enthusiastic publishers lay the essential groundwork in the field. Watchful publishers will be on the job after public meetings to ask strangers if they have questions and personally offer handbills inviting them to the following week’s talk. Reports show that some strangers spoken to a few months ago at public meetings are now regular publishers. The booklet offer may be mentioned briefly this month, after the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For 31 days during May, “daily, and in every house,” in cities and small villages near by, perfectly equipped ministers of the Most High will seek to expand, in varied Scriptural ways, their activity in preaching the message of Jehovah’s New World.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Divine Provision for Expansion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">March concluded the first thirteen weeks of circuit assemblies. During that time seventy-eight circuits were served, which include 1,555 companies and 31.293 publishers. The following observations are made to convey a clearer picture of the enthusiasm with which the brethren supported these assemblies: The 31,293 publishers shown in attendance represent 96 percent of the average number of monthly publishers in the companies that were served, and represent 80 percent of the peak number of publishers in these companies. The number of persons who listened to the public talk “Blessed Are the Peacemakers” was 54,381, or 23,088 public and persons of good-will over and above the number of publishers in attendance. There were 1,033 brethren baptized at these assemblies. This splendid record was made during the severest part of the winter, and is a very definite evidence of the spirit and power of the Lord upon his people and this method of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A Profitable Opening Night</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Field service, the very essence of the commission given to Jehovah’s witnesses has been stressed throughout these assemblies. It is the service meeting that provides instruction in field service, with its variety of talks, handling of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> articles and practical demonstrations. Servants to the brethren and those assigned will be diligent to constantly improve these meetings and literally pack them with practical, instructive and demonstrative features directed toward overcoming weaknesses in the circuit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Theocratic ministry school has been enthusiastically supported and now the study of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;</span><span class="font3"> with its added feature should encourage all attending to be prepared to participate. When filling out the circuit assembly program order, servants to the brethren should show the subject for the second student talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday Evening</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The circuit activity meeting is of vital importance, since it is ‘made to order’ to overcome problems within each circuit. Brethren have benefited greatly by this practical, frank, open discussion of conditions in companies as regards company meetings, helping publishers in the field and organizing campaigns. Greater unity is attained by this sharing of problems and discussing of the remedies therefor. Particularly has attention been directed to showing the need of aiding those weaker brethren, the irregular and inactive ones and those once associated but who now seldom attend meetings. As witli the human body, so with a company organization, rather than cast aside or shun a weak or ineffective ‘member<sup>-</sup>, the servants and publishers will be diligent to call on, encourage and heli&gt; these brethren to a condition of spiritual health resulting from full activity and participation in all company activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Building up greater interest and participation in meetings, giving of more personal instruction in the field, aiding more companies to put on public meetings, have all been discussed at these meetings, to the advancement of Kingdom interests. So as to be prepared for this meeting we suggest that during the weeks prior to the assembly brethren be considering the problems of their company and the contributing causes, noting such down on paper. Then attend the circuit activity meeting ready to share in this most practical discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the discussion of service, actual field experience, including house-to-house witnessing, back-calling and street witnessing have been the portion of those in attendance. Many newly interested persons, being moved by the spirit of the assembly, are getting their first experience in the work by having experienced publishers instruct them at the doors and in the organized back-call work. In addition, servants to the brethren report many companies showing increases in activity following their assembly, and this is borne out by the fact that each of the five months November to March witnessed the highest number of publishers for that month on record!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unquestionably the circuit assemblies are a gracious provision of the Lord for the welfare of his servants. The entire assembly is very practical. From the well-rounded-out program they experience a properly arranged service meeting and Theocratic ministry school where they not only observe, but hear profitable instruction for proper Theocratic activity. The circuit activity meeting on Saturday evening is invaluable in its obtaining of unity in the circuit and in the hearing of Theocratic ways of solving Kingdom service problems. Furthermore. Sunday provides a full day, beginning with the provision for baptism for those wishing to symbolize their consecration. Then there is the opportunity for new ones to engage in field activities. The public talk provides a splendid opportunity to acquaint the newly interested ones with the Lord’s Word and His organization. Following this is a properly conducted </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study, with the day climaxed with two constructive spiritually strengthening service talks. Hence, witli this varied, all-round instruction and field-service opportunities together with the joyous association and fellowship together, all will be strengthened to continue on unitedly in the great test of integrity. Circuit assemblies are for your good. Make all preparations to attend them, participate in all features, apply the instructions received, and share in the joyful expansion of the Kingdom activities.</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Extensive Rural Witness to Begin as Publishers Country-wide Turn Toward</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Outlying Sections</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Extensive rural witnessing! Outdoor public meetings ! A three-bound-book offer, including </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work’’</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”!</span><span class="font3"> That is the prospect facing Jehovah’s Christian witnesses during the four-month period beginning in June. Taking their cue from the words of the apostle Peter, as he opened unto the Gentiles innumerable Kingdom blessings and privileges, faithful witnesses today will do their utmost to testify regarding the mercy of God to all who will hear, especially to those living in the outlying sections of territory who have received little attention during the last live years.—Acts 10: 41-43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While working outlying sections it is fitting that we present a very substantial oiler to the people. It will be three bound books on a contribution of $1.00. featuring </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work” </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True!’</span><span class="font3"> along with one other bound book. Where this offer is not accepted, present either the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> on a 35c contribution or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”</span><span class="font3"> on contribution of 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What a composite line-up of Bible instruction in one offer! There is the full historical background of the Bible, showing its origin and writing, and brief analysis and summary of each book of the Bible, contained in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”,</span><span class="font3"> and a complete Bible treatise of a vital doctrine in each of the 24 chapters of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”. </span><span class="font3">Publishers should present the three-book combination </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font3"> and show the many features. Servants should give much thought at working out well-planned and instructive demonstrations at service meetings, showing various ways of presenting this offer with its many good talking points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to establish the summer's rural work, extensive hack-calling should be done wherever literature is placed. Effort should be made to start studies in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> and to conduct such regularly throughout the summer and fall at least. At the same time encourage the people to read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”</span><span class="font3"> lesson by lesson by pointing out how’ much valuable information they can get in so short a reading period. During a back-call take advantage of every opportunity to put to use the various features of this handbook in helping the people gain greater knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Effective Rural Witnessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With rural witnessing now to the fore, territory servants should endeavor to bring all rural assignments up to date with the latest accurate information. Such might be obtained by writing to the Department of Map Reproduction, U. S. Geological Survey. Department of Interior, Washington, D.C. Also, the State Highway Department often has information, as well as the county courthouse. Information as to obtaining rural delivery and county maps might be obtained by checking with the local post office or writing to “Superintendent”, Division of Finance, Post Office Department. Washington 25, D.C. In</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">conjunction with lining up territory, back-call servants should prepare slips for all back-call names, Including those for expired subscriptions, and see that such are in good order for the summer campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It may be necessary for the company to obtain additional rural territory from the Society to care for all publishers and pioneers associated. Special pioneers now working with companies may also spend much of their time working in rural territory during the next four months, making sure, however, that back-calls and book studies in the city assignment are properly cared for. Where special or general pioneers are working in towns in which no company is located, they may make application to the Society for assignment for the adjacent rurals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings In Rurals</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Enlarging summer rural witnessing will be the extension of public meetings to these sections. All company servants should canvass the prospects of putting on public talks in small outlying towns and villages as well as rural areas. Fairgrounds, schoolhouses, grange halls, small parks, or even someone's front yard, all yield prospects for public meetings. Advertising for such will be carried on Saturday in the local shopping center and by calling on the people Saturday and Sunday. Public talks can be put on even on Saturday afternoons and evenings in many small towns, thus serving many farmers in for their shopping. The series will consist of at least four talks each, except where circumstances necessitate that a shorter series be put on. Co-operation between companies in putting on many public meetings can be efficiently worked out by the servants and discussed during the circuit assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Planning Car Groups</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When groups go into the rurals they should spend many hours, leaving early in the morning, taking a lunch along, and working all day. Real planning is necessary for the maximum of accomplishment. Groups will be made up at service meetings for the week’s activity, in conjunction with the public meeting campaign in outlying territory. Car groups will be assigned sufficient rural territory for the series. Other witnessing groups of publishers will be lined up and assigned territory in certain outlying towns and villages that they can reach by bus or train, spending the entire day in the territory. City witnessing will also be arranged for those unable to work In rurals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Where they can do so, publishers will arrange to spend weekdays working rurals, and to this end pioneers and special pioneers who have cars will greatly aid companies by spending certain weekdays taking publishers into the rural territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Rurals should be worked in the following manner. Nearly every rural assignment has its thickly settled portions and small villages where three or four of the stronger and more energetic publishers of a car group «*’&gt; be let off w<sup>T</sup>ith a supply of literature and can work such territory by walking. The remainder of the car group can go into the sparsely settled rurals. and in this manner accomplish more work with less waiting. Definite arrangements to pick up the other publishers will be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The car driver should study his map and plan how the work can be done with greatest efficiency. The group may work out some roads, do crossroads and work back toward home on another road. A house-to-house record should be kept so that proper follow-up can be made. Of course, most rurals will not have roads named nor will houses be numbered, but by identifying highway numbers or certain named roads, indicating where you start by certain known landmarks, noting houses by counting first, second, etc., from such marks, showing color of house and marking left or right, it is possible to keep a very accurate record. Roads leading off would be worked and recorded as they came, the houses on such being numbered from one on up, for each side road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calling In Rurals</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If proper record has been kept and the car driver plans his work properly, he will work a certain section of territory the first day out. The next time he will go over a certain section, where books have been placed previously, and make some back-calls on the way to the new territory. Near the end of the day’s witnessing this time, the car group will start toward home by a different road where there are back-calls to be made. As the group works farther out more back-calls will accumulate on the different roads and require careful attention on the part of the driver to see that publishers be given assistance in making back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the development of back-calls comes book studies. It might not always be possible to hold book studies every week in outlying rurals ; but perhaps studies every other week might be arranged. It will be necessary to drop off those publishers who have studies, and during this time the other publishers will perhaps work near-by not-at-homes or other back-calls. Usually some sort of schedule can be worked out so that everyone can keep busy making back-calls, conducting studies and sharing in working additional rural territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Briefly, the above outlines the prospects. The results depend entirely upon the efforts of servants and publishers. Start making plans now. Make the 1947 rural campaign the greatest campaign of summer witnessing to date. Provide for very extensive coverage of rural territory and for the starting of studies therein. As Jehovah’s Christian witnesses, share to the full in extending the message of truth to others anil in receiving the many attending blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Amnesty</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is now gathering Information on each one of Jehovah’s witnesses who has been convicted under the Selective Training and Service Act from 1941 to 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If any man has not received the letter dated March 12, 1947, containing questions to be answered, please write us or obtain such from some pioneer or company servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The information called for in the letter should be sent in immediately, and by no means later than May 15,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This notice does not apply to brethren who have already provided us with the information.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Many brethren have responded to the call issued by the Society for more pioneers and have now been enrolled and placed in the vanguard of Jehovah's army of gospel-preachers. This immediate response is very gratifying, but the subject should not lie allowed to end here. Instead, the opportunity and privilege of taking up pioneer activity should be held constantly before all God’s people in order that they may carefully and diligently plan their life’s course with the objective of becoming full-time ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">District servants, servants to the brethren, and servants of the companies should regularly present this matter of becoming pioneers while serving the companies and circuit assemblies. Make it part of the admonition and instruction to the brethren for their improvement as able ministers in Jehovah’s service. Pioneers likewise, show the others by your own steadfast course how it is possible to continue in full-time service through faith in Him who is able to sustain you. Encourage all who possibly can take up pioneer service to do so, that their joy may be full and the Kingdom gospel made known to many. Youthful servants of God, take advantage of the opportunity to become vacation pioneers so that you too may join in praising Jehovah's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The love, faith, and zeal of God’s people in carrying out their commission to preach the gospel will cause many of them to become pioneers. After fully counting the cost, and weighing ail the prospective difficulties and hardships, the fact will still remain: Jehovah can and w’ill sustain those who put the Kingdom interests first. Cast in your lot with Him who owns the cattle on a thousand hills and can crown your efforts with untold blessings now and in the end grant eternal life.</span></p>

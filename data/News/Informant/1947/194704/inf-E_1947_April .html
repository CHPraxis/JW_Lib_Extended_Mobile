</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Another Peak of Publishers Expected</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The matter of shining forth in the kingdom of Jehovah is no negative, inanimate stand, but a living, active, burning brilliance, reflecting the glory of Jehovah. This is clearly implied by the concluding words of our April text: “He that hath ears, let him hear.” (Matt. 13 : 43, A.8.1<sup>7</sup>.) If the Kingdom message of our day finds a responsive echo in the heart, and impels to Theocratic action, that is proof that we are hearing the message of the Lord with understanding. Such hearing amounts to a command to those who are so blessed to “arise and shine”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">If we hear, iee must shine,</span><span class="font3"> reflect, the glory of Jehovah. If we do not, it is an indication that we are not hearing with understanding and may be drifting toward the ‘dull of hearing' class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the midst of the bedlam, confusion and darkness of the Devil’s organization, and the weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth of the wicked, the servants of the Lord, as light-bearers of Jehovah, “shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father” ; a privilege appreciated and enjoyed by the remnant and reflected by their faithful companions, who are now dwelling in the light of the presence of the King. The many features of service for the month of April give ample opportunity for ail to reflect this light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is the climax of the subscription campaign, increased back-call activity, and the start of the new public meeting talks. And not only will all publishers share in these features, but April will witness arrangements to extend the share in reflecting this light to many persons of good-will who not only have ‘ears to hear’ but desire to say to others ‘Come and take of the water of life freely’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Watchtower”-“Awake!” Offer Climaxed</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During April the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazines, with a premium of two bound books, will be presented on a $2.00 contribution. Present this with conviction, knowing that the benefits the people will derive from it will be far in excess of any amount they may give for it. Every publisher knows that the message contained in these magazines means life to the people. Our job is to make the people appreciate this point too. Make your presentation so clear and forceful that they will feel the need of having a New World messenger coming to their home every week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whole-hearted participation in all features of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign includes, in addition to obtaining the complete subscription, the “establishing” of all the subscribers. Assist them by calling back upon them, arranging for home </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> studies, and, where-ever possible, taking them from house to house and in any branch of able to the new interest that they will want to continue. A discussion of the many interesting points of each witness and plans to cope with each problem you encounter as you go from house to house is very helpful. Let each regular publisher make it a point to take at least one newly interested person or one irregular publisher into the service with him during April, particularly the weekend of the 5th and 6th. By thus aiding one another we are encouraging our brethren and the people of good-will who desire to serve the Lord to have some part, either directly or indirectly, in shining forth in the kingdom of their Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The circuit assembly is a provision of the Lord for the expansion of The Theocracy. It should be vigorously supported when held in your circuit. Go to it and joyfully support all its activities. Make it your business to see to it that all goodwill back-calls and new interest are advised about it and encouraged to attend. All subscriptions taken at circuit assemblies are to be turned in at the assemblies with the name of the company holding that territory as the company sending them in (not the company with which the publisher who obtained the subscription is associated). However, each subscription should be reported to the company with which the publisher is associated, and will be included in only that company's report to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At circuit assemblies, at Kingdom halls and at all other meeting places, Kingdom light-bearers will always conduct themselves in a manner that will aid and encourage good-will interest as well as our brethren in Kingdom activity. Shine fortli in the Kingdom reflecting the glory of your Father.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">the service in which they are willing to engage. This is all a part of a Christian's life. These persons too must know and work in God’s service if they are to live in the new earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Important: Expirations Require Prompt Attention</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To companies throughout the country the Society is mailing slips containing names of persons whose subscriptions for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazines have expired. These people should be called upon promptly and an effort made to get them to resubscribe. At one time they were interested enough to subscribe. Try to ascertain why they permitted their subscription to lapse. That will be your cue on which to work. Show them the importance of having the magazine coming to their home regularly, as well as studying the premium book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font3"> Offer to call back and help them with their study of the magazine. These slips have been run early. In some cases it may be known to the publisher that per- | sons have already renewed their subscription. Don’t ignore the slips, nor should a complaint be sent in. Call back on such; show an interest in them; let them get to know you and your desire to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let us further shine by putting forth every effort to make the public meeting campaign, beginning April G. the start of the mightiest public witness to date. Let the spirit of the “Memorial” continue to surge through us individually and collectively, to the glory of the Lord. Aid all regular and irregular publishers and inactive good-will to regular and active participation in these meetings. By precept and example aid everyone to have some part in this service, if it is only a matter of putting out handbills for an hour or two, or by going on the street or from house to house with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Evening Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Regular participation in the evening work and handbill distribution is another very effective means of shining forth. We have many letters from brethren everywhere informing us of tlie blessings they are receiving in this work all the year round. People are at home and usually in a relaxed, receptive mood, and willing to talk about the Kingdom. We heartily counsel all companies to inaugurate this feature of the Kingdom service. Like all other Kingdom joys, it cannot be fully appreciated until one participates in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak of Publishers Anticipated</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By this joint co-operation one other important feature can be accomplished, namely, a peak of publishers during the month of April. Get-ling new publishers out in the service is the objective of every good publisher, but getting them out once is not the end of the matter. Regular participation in the service should be made so reasonable and desir</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>New Cost List</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> the Society is sending the new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cost List;</span><span class="font3"> one for each pioneer and three for each company (one for the company servant and one each for the accounts and stock servants). Beginning April 1 all orders of literature and magazine distributors’ copies for companies and pioneers will be charged the new rates. The change of rates affecting the public will go into effect on May 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The company servant and stock servant should study together the first few pages dealing with instructions on how to order. Pioneers should'also consider this material. By carefully adhering to such when making orders much time will be saved and better attention will be given Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The advertising servant will check with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cost List</span><span class="font3"> to determine the rates for magazines. The company servant’s copy will also be available to any of the publishers who wish to check on rates.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Effective Group Witnessing</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Plan in Advance;</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Assist Weaker Publishers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The inauguration of the public meeting campaign not only opened to all companies a new avenue of witnessing, but also brought with it emphasis on group witnessing. And with the improved and expanded instructions regarding advertising the public meetings, discussed in the March </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> this method of witnessing comes in for even more attention. Why this emphasis on group witnessing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To begin with, group witnessing is the ideal method of completely covering a certain territory in connection with the advertising of a series of public meetings. Also, by means of it territory that might otherwise be neglected is given the needed witness. And most important, group witnessing provides opportunities for servants in the companies, pioneers and other experienced publishers to show a personal interest in the new, weak, youthful, irregular or somewhat negligent publishers by giving them practical demonstrations and individual counsel as to how to carry on the various features of the work, in actual field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Meeting Arrangements</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For group witnessing to be effective and accomplish the greatest amount of good, however, it must be taken seriously and given adequate attention beforehand. The specific territory to be witnessed is selected, of course, at the time the public meeting series is planned. Toward the end of the service meeting preceding the first public meeting of a series time should be devoted to the assigning of publishers to groups under captains previously chosen and provided with territory. If at all possible such groups should continue throughout the series, making it unnecessary to arrange new groups each week. As far as possible, publishers should equip themselves with literature and other witnessing supplies on the service meeting night or prior to the Sunday group witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For at least the first Sunday of each public meeting series it would be well for all to come together in the morning at some convenient meeting place, preferably the hall at which the public meeting is to be held. A suitable program should be arranged for, the reading of the day's text and comments, service instructions as to the literature offer and its manner of presentation, and concluding prayer, after which all will depart to the field. This should be an interesting and instructive meeting from twenty to not more than thirty minutes in length and will be arranged by the company servant. While it may not be convenient for all to meet in this manner every Sunday, each group should arrange to assemble for field service at some convenient place each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to group witnessing on Sundays, help can be given the</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Perfectly Equipped for Expansion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Intensive Booklet Campaign Outlined for May</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Activity Provides Wonderful Opportunity to Make Advancement as Perfectly Equipped Ministers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Your Personal Invitation to Pioneer Service</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">The man of God must continually add to his knowledge and ability to serve Jehovah. There is a constant increase or expansion in this respect from the time when as a babe in capacity he eagerly takes up the service of the Creator until that glad time when he becomes mature and complete, perfectly equipped by God's kind leadings for every good work.—2 Tim. 3:16,17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Weym.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The entire visible organization of God thus moves forward also. Through Jehovah’s instruction and guidance his people are cleansed and prepared. They are built up into a holy nation rid of all encumbrances and purged of all idle and unwilling ones, until the organization stands strong in the Lord, expanding to all parts of the earth, fulfilling the divine commission of showing forth the praises of him who called them from darkness into his marvelous light. No perfectly equipped servant will be idle during the month of May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">prepare Now for a Very Effective Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During this busy month of May an intensive booklet campaign will be carried on as a follow-up of the increased public meeting activity of April. This will give all those who commenced their field-service activity by advertising the public talks a fine opportunity to take a further step by taking part in booklet distribution. Give them a helping hand. Invite every willing person in your vicinity to come with you and present the booklets in door-to-door witnessing. This is one of the easiest ways of giving public testimony; so make arrangements to provide these new publishers with every possible opportunity to share therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition, set aside certain territory for evening distribution so that you can take advantage of the lighter evenings at this time of the year. Daylight saving time may also be in effect in many areas, thus aiding in this respect. Make up combinations of the booklets on hand on the basis of seven booklets on contribution of 25c and three booklets on a 10c contribution. These combinations will, of course, include a balanced arrangement of colored-cover and self-covered booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Stock servants should start now to make up combinations for May’s distribution. Those companies lacking sufficient booklets can order from the Society. Just state which booklets you are well supplied with and the quantity of G4-page coloredcover, 64-page self-covered or 32-page booklets you need. Whatever stock is necessary to make up combinations will then be sent to you. Pioneers needing supplies of booklets may obtain them from a nearby company wherever convenient, or they may order from the Society. When obtained from a company, the stock servant will supply them at pioneer rates, and at the end of the month the company servant will inform the Society of the total number of 64-page and 32-page booklets thus taken. Upon receipt of this sheet signed by the company servant and the stock servant, the Society will credit the company with the difference between company and pioneer rates. It will not be necessary to list each pioneer’s amount or the kind of booklet separately. Merely show the total number of 64-page and of 32-page booklets supplied at pioneer rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Many Branches of Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Due to the paper shortage it will not be possible to print a new booklet for this campaign. However, with upward of 20,000,000 booklets in stock rooms throughout the U. S., this campaign provides an excellent opportunity to distribute and furnish the people with these booklets, and all publishers will be eager to take advantage of It. Special effort will be made by all companies to concentrate on city and small-town territory in a vigorous windup of ‘winter’ territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May will also provide opportunity for additional effort in continuing with the new series of public lectures. These are very forceful up-to-date topics and will enable every company to put on energetic public meetings that should be zealously supported by every publisher. See that the people throughout the land have the opportunity to come and hear these vital topics discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We must not forget the expiring magazine subscriptions either. Do not allow the people whose subscriptions are expiring to casually drop them. Show them the necessity of continuing to receive and study the truths coming from God’s table. Arrange for home </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and book studies throughout the territory, so that those now of good-will may in God’s due time also become perfectly equipped for every good work. As servants of God, advance in knowledge and ability to share in every good work. Attain to that maturity and full stature of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> man of God whose whole life will be spent in faithful, willing service to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Summer Activity Features Three-Bound-Book Offer </span><span class="font3">The four-month campaign beginning June 1, concentrating on rural territory, will high-light placement of three bound books, on a contribution of $1.00. In every combination will be included the Society’s Bible handbook “L’q«ippe&lt;Z </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">for Every Good Work”,</span><span class="font3"> the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”, </span><span class="font3">and any other bound book in stock. To date </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”</span><span class="font3"> has been obtainable by company publishers and pioneers at 50c. As of April, however, the rate to company publishers will be 45c, and the rate to pioneers lowered as announced in the new pioneer cost list. The contribution rate to the public is 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the campaign company publishers may obtain </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”</span><span class="font3"> at 35c. Companies ordering the book will be charged this rate until the conclusion of the campaign in September. After October 1 the regular charge of 45c will be made. Literature for the campaign may be ordered now. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot; </span><span class="font3">will be considered “campaign literature&quot;. hence chargeable to the account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Good Work”</span><span class="font3"> all publishers, appreciating Its value to truth-seekers everywhere, will be diligent to place it in combination with the two other bound publications at every home possible during the coming campaign. Servants should make preparation now, lining up territory and arranging to assist all associated to unite in an extensive rural witness this summer. Many “sheep” in these outlying sections will gladly receive this substantial offer.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Thoroughly Study Third 1947 Pioneer Letter</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report.” Abel, Noah. Abraham, Jacob, Christ Jesus, the apostles, all obtained a “good report” in the sight of Jehovah. They had </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">faith,</span><span class="font3"> and they exercised that faith in service to Jehovah. Today, many years since the utterance of Paul’s words, Jehovah’s servants are called upon to exercise that same faith in him by becoming pioneers and assist in fulfilling the tremendous obligation resting upon us, namely, carrying “this gospel” to the ends of the earth. The need for pioneers is vital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society, recognizing this urgent demand, is sending with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> the third letter this year calling for more pioneers. It should be viewed as a very personal invitation from Jehovah through his organization to enter the pioneer ranks. Each one receiving a copy of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> will be given his own individual pioneer letter. This is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font3"> letter; study it carefully, prayerfully ; give it your individual attention and seek diligently to apply it. Also, family groups should give due consideration to the letter. Possibly, by planning, some members of the family can enter pioneer service, if not all. Finally, study this letter with the local company. The company servant will arrange to have it read by a good reader at the first </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study and first service meeting after its receipt, and then thoroughly discussed by a competent brother at a service meeting during the month. To receive a full measure of benefit therefrom, it is suggested that where possible the study of the letter be followed up with several selected experiences from pioneers, recounting the Lord’s provision for them in time of need,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Good work!</span><span class="font3"> With February showing a drop in activity? Yes, good work, for after a comparatively mild winter, February saw this country swathed in blizzards and snowstorms, from one end to the other, such as had not been seen in years; and yet, in spite of this, the report shows over a thousand more publishers tliis February than any previous February.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Four months in a row, November, December, January and February, each has witnessed the highest number of publishers for its respective month on record. Keep it up.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Magazine Bags</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">We have a limited supply of magazine bags on hand. Due to increased costs of material the price of these bags will be 35c each to all publishers. The additional charge is being made on all back orders for rnaga-zine bags that are being filled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Companies and pioneers may order these now, keeping in mind that these are cash items and remittance must accompany all orders. in the way of food, shelter, clothing and innumerable Kingdom joys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Summer Vacation Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the approach of the summer months schools will be closing for their annual vacation. The invitation is extended to youthful witnesses of Jehovah to pioneer for at least two months, during their summer vacation period. This arrangement affords a splendid opportunity to ‘remember your Creator in the days of your youth’ and to exercise that same faith mentioned by Paul. Further, by participating in the summer work, the youthful minister is laying a solid foundation for future service to Jehovah. Tn the years to come, when he has launched out on the road of the “regular” pioneel<sup>-</sup> publisher, it will be a heartwarming joy to view in retrospect the hours wisely expended in the summer-vacation service, to realize that it was there that he began the unequaled lifetime occupation, and that he had faithfully spent his time in that which was to be to his future welfare, rather than squandering it in idleness and the ways of this world. Y’es, it is a grand opportunity. Plan now for summer activity; write for your application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why not add your name to the list of those who obtain a “good report” through faith, in the pioneer service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 4) </span><span class="font3">new or weak publishers by arranging for group witnessing on Saturdays in connection with advertising the public meetings, in both house-to-house and street activity. New publishers may start out by just distributing handbills. Further, there is group booklet-work in the evening. This evening activity, however, need not on all occasions be limited to the booklet offer, for many have reported excellent results from presenting the regular campaign literature offers in the evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Call Group Witnessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As noted in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font3"> paragraphs 20 to 23 inclusive, group witnessing is not merely for the purpose of covering territory. House-to-house group witnessing should be followed through by evening back-call group activity, calling back on all placements and where interest has been found. And if there is need for training publishers how to present the message of the Kingdom from house to house, and there is, how much greater the need of training them in bow to make back-calls and how to start book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To this end let each mature publisher, wherever possible, come to the Kingdom Hall or book-study meeting point on back-call nights and arrange to take along a publisher needing training in the back-call and book-study work. Thereby you will be aiding your brother at the same time that you are feeding the &quot;‘other sheep”. And keep it up. Do not expect them to acquire ability and confidence to make back-calls and conduct book studies after just one or two evenings. And as they show appreciation of this feature of the work let them make a call or two on their own, and perhaps turn over a book study to them. Then look around for another publisher that needs help in this feature of the work and train him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We spend much time in ‘hunting’ and ‘fishing’ for the “other sheep” and then in feeding them. Let us not neglect those who have taken their stand and who may need help. Remember, “no man lives unto himself” also applies to our field service. Tako part in group witnessing.</span></p>

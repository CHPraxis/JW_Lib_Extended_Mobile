<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Servants to Set Example in All Features of the Work</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">“Upon the earth distress . . . perplexity ; . . . men’s hearts failing them for fear.” How accurately Jesus’ great prophecy foretold present conditions of sorrow, strife and confusion ! Such conditions, however, do not dismay Jehovah’s servants, for they heed the admonition long ago given: “Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all ye that hope in Jehovah.” (Ps. 31:24, A.S.V.; our text for July) To be “stronghearted for international praising” we must ‘keep our hearts with all diligence’. That means filling the heart (mind) with the right things, with the truths concerning Jehovah, his kingdom, and his requirements for us. It means individual study. It also means parents’ arranging for family group study, assisting their children in the study of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, “Equipped for Every Good Work”</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True!’, </span><span class="font3">and thus faithfully discharging their obligations to bring up their children in the “nurture and admonition of the Lord”. And it means one and all attending and taking part in the meetings where these publications are studied. Only by continued study and service shall we be able to face the world turmoil and Its inevitable destruction with abiding confidence in Jehovah, with strong hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During July all Kingdom publishers will continue to present the special bound-book offer featuring </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work” </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font3"> together with one other bound book, on a contribution of one dollar. By now each one should be familiar with the contents of these publications, so as to be prepared for each circumstance. As a recent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> expressed it, ‘be alert to sense the state of affairs and then call upon your store of knowledge and use that knowledge aright.’ From early reports at hand it is quite apparent that the campaign has gotten off to a very good start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Rurals Proving Fruitful Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This offer is especially for the rurals. Therefore thoroughly cover your rural territory, reaching </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font3">home. Where no rural territory is available, concentrate on city territory, beginning with that which has been without a witness the longest. Should you run out of the featured books before your next shipment arrives, do not slack the hand, but continue with any three bound books on a dollar contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having planted the seed, let us not leave it to chance to prosper. Water it, clear out the stones and thorns, by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">calling hack.</span><span class="font3"> Start book studies with them and also show them how they can conduct a study by themselves. There are many of good-will in the rurals. In fact, pioneers report that much of their interest is located in the surrounding rurals. In some areas companies have been started recently consisting almost entirely of persons of good-will living in the rurals. True, it requires more effort to call on these, but the results more than make up for it</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Thorough Preparation Necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Just as individual organization is necessary for one to do his best, so group organization is indispensable for a company to accomplish the most good in the rural campaign. Service arrangements for the succeeding week should be definitely made at each service meeting (some companies are still not doing this) ; taking into consideration every factor involving the efficiency of the work. For instance, book-study groups may be utilized in car groups for week-end rural witnessing; those able to stay all day should be assigned to one car, while others who are able to work only </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> few hours would be assigned to another group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During July the public meeting campaign should also be pushed to the limit. Endeavor to obtain schoolhouses, halls, and particularly outside meeting places. W’here all else fails, use a vacant lot or the front yard of the home of a person of good-will. Many report good attendance at such meetings, frequently better than at those held inside. July is also a very good month for evening house-to-house work. (For further instructions regarding the summer campaign see the May </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the Lord’s arrangement each one has a responsible assignment, and therefore each one must perform his part in the service. Particularly should servants in the company measure up to their privileges, for, more having been committed to them, of them more will be required. Therefore let all servants be examples to the flock by being diligent in all features of the service. Take the lead in the house-to-house, back-call, book-study, street advertising and public meeting activities. So doing each company of Jehovah’s servants will be a stronghearted unit for international praising.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Literature</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">As of May 1, 1947, all literature in stock is to be placed with the publishers and the public at the rates in the new cost list. Companies will evaluate all literature on their progressive inventories at the new rates regardless of when the literature was received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many brethren, when they received a shipment of literature less than what they ordered have waited expectantly for the balance of it to arrive. As noted on the invoice, only literature actually listed on the invoice will be shipped. Items ordered but which have been canceled are never charged on an invoice, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font3"> be reordered later if they are desired.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Have You Made Preparations to Attend?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The time set aside for the 1947 National Convention of Jehovah's witnesses, August 13-17, is rapidly drawing near. If you are planning to attend and have not made the necessary preparations, you should do so at once in order to insure your full enjoyment of this gathering of the Lord’s servants. Mail your Room Request Form immediately to Watchtower Convention, 106 W. Venice Blvd., Los Angeles 15, Calif. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Be certain it is completely filled out. </span><span class="font3">If you do not give all the information required, the Rooming Committee cannot serve you efficiently and the resulting delay may be your loss. Use the Room Request Form In all instances ; do not write, and do not send duplicate requests. If you do not receive an assignment before leaving home for Los Angeles, call for it at the Rooming Department, which will be located in the Concourse on the 42nd Place side of Wrigley Field beginning Monday morning, August 11. If you receive your private-home assignment before you leave for Los Angeles, it would be well to confirm it by writing to the landlady. Be certain to notify the landlady if you cannot be there on the day specified, as she will be expecting you on the day shown on your Room Assignment Card and will be waiting for you. Go directly to your assigned room upon arrival at Los Angeles. If for any reason you find your room canceled, the Rooming Department will be able to give you another assignment upon request. Those having hotel reservations should be sure to report to the hotel before 6 p.m. on the day indicated for your arrival; otherwise, unless you send the hotel a deposit equal to the cost of the room for one day, your reservations will be automatically canceled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Details</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The trailer camp is located on East Olympic and Goodrich Blvds., which is in the eastern part of Los Angeles. Bus and streetcar transportation are available between the camp and Wrigley Field. A commissary will be set up for the sale of food for the use of those who wish to eat some meals in the camp. Programs from Wrigley Field will be transmitted to the camp for the benefit of those on duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A cafeteria will be set up adjacent to Wrigley Field that will serve three meals each day. A hot and cold plate will be provided, with good variety, including fruit and salads. Pioneers on the list as of July 1 should apply at the pioneer counter in the Service Tent for meal tickets that will entitle them to three meals per day in the cafeteria. There will also be adequate refreshment stands scattered throughout the grounds. Volunteers for service in the cafeteria should report to the Volunteer Service counter in the Concourse immediately upon arrival. Bring suitable clothing for your work. Much help will be needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren who have special trades and who are coming to Los Angeles ten days or so early should please register on arrival at the convention headquarters, 106 W. Venice Blvd. All other brethren attending the convention who wish to serve in some capacity should report to the Volunteer Service counter in the Concourse of Wrigley Field just north of the main entrance when they arrive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Considerable sound equipment will be needed. Brethren having such equipment available should please write to 106 W. Venice Blvd., describing in detail what you have. Do not bring or send the equipment unless so instructed by the Convention Committee. Brethren with sound cars should register at the Sound Department upon arrival. Brethren who are sound technicians should likewise register upon arrival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A bookroom will be provided in the Service Tent, but you should bring your own literature if it is convenient for you to do so. The current combination of three books for $1.00 (including </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”</span><span class="font3"> wherever possible) will be used in the field during the five convention days. A few copies of the latest </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> should also be brought, as there is a scarcity of distributors’ copies at the present time. There will be opportunity for regular door-to-door service, magazine witnessing, placard advertising, and handbill distribution. All publishers should bring their witnessing equipment, including identification cards. Advertising material for the public lecture will be provided at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those planning to depart from Los Angeles on August 17, 18 or 19 on busses or trains should register their time of departure at the Transportation Desk provided they are not in special train or bus groups or do not have return reservations. Do this before noon on August 15. This will enable us to advise the transportation companies of the amount of equipment required at the conclusion of the convention. The Transportation Desk will be located in the Concourse at Wrigley Field, just north of the main tower entrance. If you are traveling by automobile from the East, keep in mind that it will be best to cross the desert parts of the route in the late afternoon, early evening or early morning. Temperatures of 100 degrees or more are encountered during midday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An immersion will be held for the benefit of those desiring to symbolize their consecration. Candidates should bring their own bathing suits, towels, etc. Brethren who desire to serve in the orchestra should report to the Volunteer Service counter, and musical instruments should be brought along. All brethren should bring their songbooks to the assembly. Brethren who have good cameras and photographic equipment and who bring this along may register at the Photography Department.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Well-balanced Service Meeting Requires Planning</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Practical Application of Instructions Necessary</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">A planned, well-balanced, instructive service meeting is essential for strong Theocratic growth in the local company. The beneficial effects of a well-planned service meeting are manifold : It keeps the Kingdom publisher in step with tiie activity of the Theocratic organization worldwide; it assures continued contact with local company service arrangements and aids in skillfully presenting the Kingdom message. All in all it is refreshing and strengthening, aiding in 'equipping for every good work’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Servant co-operation Is required for a well-balanced service meeting. All servants in the company should feel the need, yes, the obligation of offering suggestions for the service meeting. These suggestions will receive careful consideration by the company servant, who should discuss the various recommendations with the servants. Any suggestions from publishers will also be welcomed and considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Properly Consider &quot;Informant”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because all service meetings are based on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> it must be included in order to have a well-balanced meeting. However, to be effective the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> must be handled properly, which means that the brethren considering the articles should prepare thoroughly In advance. The material may be presented in the form of questions and answers, with care being taken in selecting questions and making certain that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> main points in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> are covered. This is important. Occasionally, an appropriate scripture might be used to bear out the main theme. Also, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font3">articles may be considered by means of extemporaneous talks. Such talks should fully cover the material and be practical, showing the logical application of the instruction to the local company. Ask: How can </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ice </span><span class="font3">apply this instruction to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font3"> company?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Practical Service Suggestions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another method of presenting information at service meetings is by means of short service talks on the various features of Kingdom work. These should not consist merely of general Scriptural counsel, but practical instruction. “Practical” means &quot;capable of being turned to use, useful”. Hence, a “practical” service talk would contain useful, workable suggestions for everyday service in the local company. For example: Perhaps the company is stressing back-calls on interest located in rural public meeting work. The one speaking on the matter could tell how the company is planning for back-call work, clearly outlining what arrangements have been made to date and what is expected of the brethren. Next, offer practical suggestions for carrying out these service plans, such as w’ays and means of arranging rural back-call groups, useful methods of applying locally the suggestions for rural back-calling as outlined in the May </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> and reasonable ways of budgeting time to take part in back-call activity. Such talks tend to increase the publishers’ appreciation and participation in local service campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Demonstrations occupy an outstanding place on a good service program. lake the service meeting itself, demonstrations should be well planned if they are to be of value to the publisher, which means that those assisting therein should thoroughly rehearse beforehand. Further, demonstrations should be instructive, within reason, and well timed, not needlessly humorous or entertaining, and should have a particular objective in view. For instance, instead of merely demonstrating the back-call work in general, show how to make the first back-call, how to present the month’s offer on back-calls, practical application of Theocratic ministry on back-calls, or how to assist irregular publishers in the back-call work. Also, the brethren in the audience may be permitted to comment on what they would do under like circumstances. For demonstrations to be effective instruments for Theocratic instruction they must be presented wisely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a further aid to instructive meetings, round-table discussions can be utilized to good advantage. Such discussions are regular open forums. From two to four brethren assemble on the platform and carry on an oral consideration of an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> article or some part of the Kingdom work. Now and then field experiences had by the brethren should be used to show the results of practical application of the knowledge gained at the well-planned service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The service meeting is also the place to make definite service arrangements. This would especially include devoting time to lining up car groups for week-end group-wit-nessing activity. Announcements regarding assemblies or public meetings, communications from the Society and any other service announcements should all be considered at the service meeting. Such announcements should be brief and definite, concise. And finally, the time element must be considered. Service meetings as a w’hole, as well as each feature therein, should be kept within the allotted time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By taking advantage of these and other methods of presentation, by advance servant co-operation and planning and by giving practical suggestions in the application of instructions locally, your service meetings will be well-balanced, instructive, interesting and well-attended. Truly, such assemblies will assist all publishers of the Kingdom to be “perfectlv equipped for every good work”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font3"> 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A Lost and Found department will be set up in the Concourse at Wrigley Field. Children who have strayed from their parents may be taken to this department. First aid service will be available at the assembly. Brethren who are doctors and nurses and who wish to volunteer for this service may report to the Volunteer Service counter. A post office will be operated for your convenience at Wrigley Field. Brethren can use Wrigley Field, Los Angeles, Calif., as their mailing address during convention. Brethren who are deaf-mutes will be glad to learn of provision for the convention sessions to be interpreted for their benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those attending the assembly will reap the greatest benefit from it if they participate to the full in its activities. It is an assembly for service and worship, and the people of good-will attending book studies should be encouraged to participate. Assist them to a better vision of the Lord’s organization by aiding them to attend the convention and associate witli those of like precious faith. This is a grand opportunity, especially for the brethren in the West, to introduce your good-will interest to the blessed assemblies held by those who are stronghearted for praising Jehovah’s name. Let the joy of the Lord be their joy, too! They will hasten to join you in singing praises to His name.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“All Nations Expansion” Testimony Period </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Volume of Praise Ever Increasing</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Will You Add Your Voice in August?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Those acquainted with the faithful gospel-preaching activities of Jehovah’s servants in these latter days have watched with joy the gradual increase and expansion thereof under the direction and blessing of Jehovah, who foretold such results in Isaiah’s prophecy (54:2,3). From a very insignificant beginning tiie glad tidings have gone out in an ever-swelling tide, causing some here, some there, to also add their voices, until now like a mighty anthem the tongues of many thousands are singing Jehovah’s praises throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The small ‘tent’ that once housed the little band of gospel-preachers has become too small as Zion now breaks forth on the right hand and on the left. The visit of Brother Knorr to the far corners of the earth has brought to light groups of zealous servants of the Lord hitherto unknown to us, and the time has come to lengthen the cords and strengthen the stakes so that all who wish to uphold Jehovah's true worship may be joined together in one harmonious organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Zeal on the Home Front</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The joyful part of this whole arrangement is that zealously looking to the advancement of the Kingdom interests right In our own vicinity is also contributing to the world-wide expansion. This increase will he still furthered by actively continuing with the three-bound-book presentation upon a contribution of a dollar during the month of August. The</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Seventh Best Month</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">May’s field service report gives abundant proof that Jehovah blesses diligent service. Special publishers showed diligence, surpassing both their hour and back-call requirements ; company publishers showed diligence, meeting their hour and exceeding their back-call quota; while general pioneers also did well, going above their quotas both iu back-calls and in book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a result a total of 71,719 publishers reported service in the field. True, this represents a slight drop from our all-time peak, but when compared with previous years, what do we find? That May 1947 eclipsed any previous May on record by more than 6,01X1 publishers! Surely this is cause for rejoicing, our seventh best month in succession. And w’ith vacations beginning, continued good weather and long daylight hours, and particularly servants in the companies continuing to aid the weaker ones, there is every reason why our reports for the coming months should likewise continue to be the best. Let’s keep it up! all to Jehovah's praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">time is urgent for men not to be merely witnessed to. but to be taken beyond that first step and by careful study of God's Word shown how they can take their stand on the side of truth and righteousness. So, in addition to presenting the offer of the month, hold home book and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font3"> studies wherever the people manifest interest. Garry on all features of Kingdom service with the direct object in view of ‘enlarging the place of thy tent’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Additional Blessings and Privileges</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Los Angeles convention will also revive and stimulate the hearts and minds of all who attend, and while traveling to and from that joyful gathering the Lord’s people will be glad to proclaim the Kingdom gospel and leave literature wherever possible. They will return home filled with zeal and will join with those who were not tit the convention in a vigorous participation in every feature of the “All Nations Expansion” Testimony Period activity. Thus during August the three-bound-book offer will be taken from door to door, home studies will be built up, the smiling faces of the Lord’s people will be seen regularly on the streets advertising the Kingdom gospel message, and organized public meetings will be held in all sections of the territory. Let men of good-will know that Zion is expanding. Throw' the gates wide open so that all who desire may come and swell the numbers of those upholding Jehovah’s true worship.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Publishers Eagerly Await Second Assembly</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In the latter part of June circuits country-wide will begin holding their second assembly. Undoubtedly an Improvement will be noted as any previous weaknesses are ironed out through more efficient planning and operation. Publishers know their support is vital to the assembly’s success, hence will come equipped to have part in all of its varied instructive features. Important also for edification of attendants is thorough preparation and rehearsal for delivery of service meeting and Theocratic ministry school assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">High-lighting circuit assemblies during the remainder of 1947 will be the new, dynamic public talk, “My Kingdom Not of This World”. Abounding evidence prevails to prove Christ’s kingdom is no part of this corrupt world, and peoples sickened by Satanic evils will rejoice to hear the facts. Again, descriptive handbills, together with placards, where available, will flood the community with invitations to come and learn of man’s only hope. Aware of demonic hatred of the prospering circuit assembly arrangement, publishers will alert themselves for any emergency by regular study of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So that more time will be available for preparation, servants to the brethren should now make selection of circuit assembly cities for 1948 and notify the Society thereof by August 1, 1047. Companies in cities which might provide suitable accommodations for assemblies may communicate witli the servant to the brethren on this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Everyone interested in Jehovah’s honor and his own individual welfare will prepare for and lend full support to each circuit assembly.</span></p>

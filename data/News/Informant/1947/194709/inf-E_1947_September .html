<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Host of Ministers Strengthened to Push Advance of True Worship</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">“All Nations Expansion”—that was the theme of the assembly held at Los Angeles August 13-17, attended by more than 33,000 publishers. It was fittingly named, climaxing the greatest year of expansion in the church’s history. Only twelve months before the Society’s president had discussed intimately with his brethren at Cleveland the problems of reconstruction and expansion. He told, in this connection, of his proposed world tour, assemblies in other lands, and the national 1947 convention in California. But, had the work expanded during 1947? Was there sure evidence that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">now </span><span class="font5">is God’s time for expansion of true worship into all nations? At this assembly came the thrilling answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Into 32 countries journeyed Brother Knorr and his secretary, after departure from America February 20. 1947. In most of these lands assemblies were held, attended by many thousands of publishers and strangers, seeking true worship. Branch offices to the number of 28 were visited, and given instruction to gear them for further expansion. Over 50,000 miles traveled add up to a distance twice around the globe. In almost every country it was found that servants of Jehovah, whether in direct contact with the Society’s office or not. had zealously pushed the advance of true worship. By His grace they have expanded. In Germany the number of publishers has mounted steadily from 6,000 to 19,200 since the end of World War II. In the Philippines their ranks have grown to 2,847 from 371, in just a few years. World-wide an increase of more than 30.000 publishers has been effected in the past year: the figure now stands at 202,100. Today Jehovah’s witnesses inhabit 84 nations. Gilead graduates, serving in 29 countries at the time of the Glad Nations Assembly, now minister to the good-will of 65 nations. Yes, expansion into all nations is a fact, in 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Ministers Push Farther the Advance of True Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The advance of true worship must be pushed still farther, however, into every nation and territory. For this purpose did Jehovah miraculously preserve his people through two world wars. And push the true worship under their King Jehovah’s people will do, conventioners declared as Brother Knorr sounded the keynote of the assembly in his Wednesday evening discourse. That afternoon the convention chairman, in his address of welcome, made reference to a statement in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The &quot;Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> of April, 1890. Commenting on an assembly, that statement read: “About two hundred of God’s ministers were in attendance, all told—for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> are ministers.” ’Way back in 1890, all consecrated servants were recognized as ministers. It is no different now, though the number be 200,000. Regardless of worldly claims to the contrary, Jehovah's witnesses are God’s true ministers and each declares as did Paul, “I am no peddler.” (2 Cor. 2:17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font5"> True ministers will push the advance of true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other Bethel brethren, with many years of faithful service behind them, capably delivered their varied discourses on W e d n e s d a y and Thursday afternoon, edifying the throng of ministers. Assemblers did not miss their weekly service meeting or Theocratic ministry school, for both, in model fashion, were conducted on the colorful, open-air platform adorning the center of Wrigley Field. For our Spanish-speaking expansionists special sessions in their language were held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">World Reports Stir Attendants</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Eagerly awaited were the “World Reports” by the Society’s traveling representatives, scheduled for Friday. First, however, must come the baptism of recently consecrated worshipers. That morning, in a placid pool in Burbank, 705 men, women and children joyfully submitted to immersion, before an orderly crowd of onlookers. The afternoon found an expanding audience ready to hear the reports of Brothers Henschel, Franz, Suiter and Covington. Vivid word-pictures projected us into far-off lands, there to share with fellow ministers the hardships and difficulties, the joys and blessings, that have been theirs. How close an attachment we felt toward । them! No nationalism divided us! We are one, united in pure worship. If only we could do something now to prove how much we loved them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As if in answer to their unspoken desires, Brother Knorr that evening, discussing “All Nations Expansion”, spoke of the Society’s wish to supply food to brethren in Germany and Austria, where they have been hungry for years. ‘They need food,’ he said, ‘but more than that, they need and will be sustained by knowledge of your love for them, expressed in your unselfish gift, made perhaps with sacrifice to yourself.’ Enthusiastic applause revealed wholehearted support of everyone present. (Arrangements for making financial contributions are noted elsewhere in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.)</span><span class="font5"> Other items of keen interest came to light Friday evening. Demand for literature in other lands meant no new releases at this assembly. Beth-Sarim would be disposed of. WBBR was expanding, to 5,000 watts. The amount of money used in expansion was considered, while stress was laid by Brother Knorr on the vital</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 2)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Organize Book Studies for Winter Months</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">At a time when this old world’s false shepherds fill the air with a din of calls to follow the schemes of men, how thankful can we be that the Great Shepherd, and his Good Shepherd, Christ Jesus, have provided the unmistakable voice of Kingdom truths that stands out clearly identified and accessible to all who are seeking it! Now that the gathering of the “little flock” has taken place by the Good Shepherd’s voice, the time is here when his words are to be fulfilled, namely, “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and they shall become one flock, one shepherd.” (John 10:16, A.S.F.) In Jesus’ day his sheep heard his voice and followed him because he made it known by regular and consistent preaching of the Kingdom gospel. So today, in order for these “other sheep” to be brought and to hear the voice of the Good Shepherd, that voice of Kingdom truths must be proclaimed. This is done at his command by his servants on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Heeding the Good Shepherd’s voice, all publishers will press forward in September with three books, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”, “Let God lie True”</span><span class="font5"> and one other book, on a $1.00 contribution. In this fourth and final month of the campaign we have books that present the voice of Kingdom truths so clear and unmistakably true and Scriptural that they stand out from all publications of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Finish Up Rurals</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This being the last month of the extensive rural work for the summer, all such territory not yet covered should be lined up by territory servants and worked in conjunction with the rural public meetings being held this month. Emphasize to the persons in these territories the benefit of obtaining the three books for reading throughout the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Companies will carry forward putting on public meetings in outlying areas, particularly outdoors, during September, endeavoring to care for all rural areas, so as to be ready to concentrate on city territory and accessible towns throughout the late fall and winter months. Groups for witnessing should be arranged enabling all persons, including many new publishers and perhaps persons of good-will living in these outlying sections, to have a share in sounding forth the message during September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Book Study Progress</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Good Shepherd's voice of Kingdom truths can best be established by starting book studies, particularly In the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font5"> which provides such a simple and clear presentation of many vital doctrines. During this final month of extensive rural witnessing, every book placement made during the campaign should be followed up wherever possible and developed into a book study. When leaving the rurals for the winter, be sure to leave interest properly cared for so that these new “sheep” will not stray from the truth due to neglect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since it may not be possible for publishers to call back weekly for all rural studies, these good-will persons should be assisted as much as possible now and encouraged to have perhaps weekly family studies, with publishers calling back every few weeks to assist them. Or, it may be possible where several studies are being held in an area to have these persons assemble at some central point and the company arrange for someone to conduct such outlying study weekly. In some instances where several studies are in nearly inaccessible territory, it may be necessary to turn the care of these over to the most mature and advanced person of good-will in the area, who will endeavor to care for the studies until the publishers are able to return regularly. But, whatever the arrangement, brethren will exhaust every possibility in order to see that all studies in these outlying sections w’ill be cared for during the winter months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Heeding the Good Shepherd’s voice during September will mean much planning and much work. Companies at their service meetings might review the instruction on this summer campaign appearing in the May </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font5"> so as to properly care for all features. As we start the first month of the new service year let every servant care for his responsibility of aiding weaker ones in companies and let each publisher assume his personal responsibility in telling out with increased volume the Good Shepherd’s voice of Kingdom truths so that the great multitude of “other sheep” may be brought into the fold.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>As </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Enjoys Wide Distribution</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Fearless against world conspiracy ! Fearless against the stratagems of a demon-inspired world desperately fighting the reign of Jehovah’s King and kingdom! Fearless because of perfect love for the Creator, which “casteth out fear”. Yes, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fearless</span><span class="font5"> because ‘‘God is with us”. This describes the resolute stand of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses in this conspiring postwar era. With such courage-producing love and reassurance of protection we “neither fear [the world’s] fear, nor be in dread thereof”, but confidently move forward in the service of our great Protector. (Isa. 8:12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.S.V.)</span><span class="font5"> Such perfect devotion in the hearts of fearless servants of the Lord will constantly motivate perseverance in Kingdom service such as we shall render during the “Fearless Against Conspiracy” Testimony Period in October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">October, 1947, means widespread distribution of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot; </span><span class="font5">on a contribution of 35 cents. With such an important, all-absorbing Bible textbook as the offer for the month we should not fail to present it </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">again</span><span class="font5"> to everyone in our territory even though the territory may have been covered previously therewith. Continuous effort brings results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the last year large numbers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font5"> studies have been conducted with people of good-will. Consequently, all publishers should be thoroughly familiar with this excellent publication and efficient in handling it. Through practical experience and application we have learned the value of the table of contents, the questions and scriptures, the subject and scripture indexes and its comprehensive Biblecovering chapters. Use these many features in making the presentation at the doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">well-planned</span><span class="font5"> demonstrations on presenting the offer should occupy an outstanding place on the practical service meeting program during the month. (See August </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Back to the Cities for Winter Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In October companies, pioneers and special pioneers for the most part will be turning their main attention from their summer rural-witnessing assignments, which have been worked with splendid results, and will concentrate on city territory. Attention should focus on those territories that have lain idle during the summer. Publishers will resume urban activity, being alert on every occasion to establish back-calls and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font5"> studies to continue through the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brethren already conducting back-calls and studies with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font5"> obtainers and others should encourage such to take part in October’s activity. And what better time could there be? We have just begun a grand new service year after concluding a pace-setting year of Kingdom activity showered with Jehovah’s blessing. New quotas have also been established toward which to work. Yes, by assisting irregular and inactive publishers and by introducing new interest to the service work an increase in publishers should be effected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Helpful in this respect is the public meeting campaign, which will continue to play its important role in fearless Kingdom proclamation. All companies should now begin making plans for winter public meeting series by lining up territory, engaging halls or meeting places, arranging for and assigning speakers and ordering handbills. Let October mark the beginning of an intensified public meeting campaign to be carried on through the winter months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such a complete service schedule for October affords every devoted Christian the opportunity to demonstrate his love of Jehovah by fearlessly continuing in Theocratic service in all its features during the “Fearless Against Conspiracy” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 2) </span><span class="font5">need of sticking close to God’s Word as a guide, and never following the counsel of men, if contrary thereto. Brethren leaving this session felt strongly the bond of love that unites unbreakably all true worshipers, no matter where they live or what language they speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Two Final Days of Blessings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two days of service and feasting yet remained for the multitude of expansion-minded ordained ministers. Several discourses containing invaluable information and counsel were delivered Saturday and Sunday. High-lighting Saturday’s discourses were “Turning in the Report”, a discussion of Ezekiel chapters 8 and 9, by Brother Knorr, and “The Theocratic Organization and Its Governing Body” by Brother Franz. In this latter talk was made known the absolute dependence of creatures upon the Theocratic organization, and the governing body’s being, not American, but strictly Theocratic, and not confined to any certain location on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Intensive advertising and the willingness of publishers to bring goodwill called out from the city of Los Angeles a large number of strangers, packing out Wrigley Field till a total of 45,729 attendants was reached Sunday afternoon. Splendid music produced by a chorus of Theocratic voices and the assembly orchestra delighted the entire audience for a half hour before the public talk. Then with absorbing interest they listened as the Society’s president ably and forcefully made known the inadequacy of governorship by weak, dying men and organizations, and proved from God’S Word that the perfect, permanent governor, Christ the King, now rules to the blessing of all nations. Following the convention servant’s interesting report, the assembly terminated with appropriate closing remarks by Brother Knorr. His announcement of the 1948 district assemblies brought much rejoicing. Reluctant to leave, but knowing they must, attendants headed homeward, strengthened to push forward in their territory the advance of true worship, expanding continually until the final report is made at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A rich, satisfying blessing was received by all privileged to attend, and a like assembly blessing awaits other ministers in the East, November 21-23, 1947, at Philadelphia.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Written Reviews “Perfectly Equip” Theocratic Ministers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">The servants of Jehovah move ever forward in Theocratic activity. Today, more than ever before, they appreciate that to be among the ‘wise that instruct many’ they themselves must first of all be instructed. Yes, for effective activity we must be able to meet agnostic, atheist, infidel, Protestant, Catholic, Jew, etc., with sound reasoning based on a knowledge of the facts, and particularly those contained in the Word of God. One valuable aid in this which has been provided by the Lord, through the “faithful and wise servant”, is the study of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot; </span><span class="font5">with tlie written reviews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every new such provision or instrument represents a challenge to the faith, obedience and appreciation of the servant of the Lord. Are you meeting the challenge that the written reviews present? Are you showing your faith in the Lord’s direction of the witness work? Are you diligently studying and steadily striving to improve, not only your grades (which really are only incidental) but mainly your effectiveness as a minister of the gospel? Or have you failed to take full part in this study from the beginning or else become discouraged and quit because the tests were a little harder than you had anticipated, and your first marks were rather low?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">True, the written reviews mean more work, but they are worth the effort. Not only has increased knowledge resulted through study of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;, </span><span class="font5">as evidenced by correct answers, but that knowledge is broadened even in an incorrect answer, for we are the more likely to remember the right answer after having tried hard but missed the point. So, regardless of your grade, even if five or less (as has been the case with some of our foreign-speaking brethren), keep on</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rate Change on </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the conclusion of the three-bound-book campaign in September, the cost of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;</span><span class="font5"> to companies will revert to 45c, as shown in the Cost List. All orders invoiced from October 1 on will be at this rate. trying. Do not get discouraged and quit, but continue to meet the challenge by studying harder and rejoice in the benefits received.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Correspondence</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Much time will be saved at this office, and much better attention given to correspondence, if brethren will follow a few simple rules. The full name of company, as well as the name and address of the company servant, should appear at the top of all company correspondence. Pioneers should place their name and address, and indicate their status as general or special pioneer, at the top. Date of writing should also appear at top of all correspondence. The opening paragraph should always state the purpose of the letter. Letters should be written legibly, preferably in ink or typewriter, and all correspondence should be signed by the writer. Mail should be carefully checked for accuracy before mailing. An envelope containing urgent legal matters should always be marked “Legal Desk”. All brethren will do well to review Lesson 44 of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Lessons on Bible Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first twenty lessons have been of a preliminary nature. Beginning with lesson 21, we shall be studying the books of the Bible individually, and will doubtless find these lessons even more informative and interesting. More reading will be required, however, and it cannot be too strongly emphasized that to get the full benefit out of these lessons the Bible book under consideration should be read before the evening of the lesson. Of course, the ones giving the instruction and student talks, as well as the school servant himself, could not properly take care of their assignments without doing so. (It may be well for the school servant to read to the class from the letter of February 26, 1947, sent to school servants, that part which refers to these lessons, before they begin.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Question has been raised regarding the oral review the week after the written review. It would seem that (except at circuit assemblies), instead of an oral review on the instruction talk of two weeks before, the time could be used to better advantage by having the school servant discuss the written review. Having graded (and returned) the papers, he can explain and enlarge on questions with which the brethren had the most difficulty, or which they failed to understand or to answer completely. In this way all will get increased benefit from the written review.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many isolated special, pioneer and company publishers have requested written review sheets. We are glad to advise all such that provision has been made to supply these upon request to all isolated publishers who regularly report their activity to the Society. Of course, wherever possible, such should take the written review with a near-by company.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>| Contributions for Relief I</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">| As announced by Brother | i Knorr at the “All Nations Ex- | | pansion” Assembly, the Society 1 | will purchase food through the | | CARE organization, for delivery | I to our brethren in Germany and | 1 Austria. All contributions for this | | relief must be mailed to the So- | | ciety by September 30. Brethren | | desiring to make contributions | | may mail them to the Watch | | Tower Bible and Tract Society, | I Treasurer's Office, 124 Columbia 1 1 Heights, Brooklyn 2, New York, | | along with a letter stating that I | the money is for such European | | relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">| Also, each company should set f | up in their meeting hall a con- | 1 tribution box marked “Relief”, | | where brethren may place | | amounts of money during Sep- | i tember. At the end of the month | | monies from this box will be sent | 1 to the Society, with a letter in- | | dicating its purpose, and then I | this box will be dispensed with. | | The brethren in Europe will 1 | undoubtedly be very appreciative | | of this assistance, and the mani- | | festation of love on the part of 1 | their American brethren will as- I | suredly help them a great deal. | | As Brother Knorr stated at Los | | Angeles, brethren may wish to | | set aside a certain amount each | | week, even missing an occasional 1 | meal, so as to provide money for | | this purpose and enable our | | European brethren to have a lit- | | tie of what they so sorely need.

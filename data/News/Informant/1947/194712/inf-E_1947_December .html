<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Three Books Serve as Telling Instruments of Praise</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Rightly, the two billion people alive should give praise to their Maker. But they do not. Instead, the great majority’ praise other men and serve the god of wickedness, Satan. As a result the world, enslaved to a god who offers nothing but evil, writhes in agony and plunges to its death. Some, however, do praise their Life-giver. Today these number about 200,000, only 1/10000 of the total population. But contrast their lot! They alone enjoy peace, freedom and the hope of endless life. Jehovah showers blessings upon his praisers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But how is praise rendered? Is it a “mental” praise, simply believing with closed lips that Jehovah is God? Does it reach only’ as far as the walls of a private dwelling or a Kingdom Hall? No! Jehovah’s witnesses are public praisers, calling out vigorously in “the midst of the city”, from house to house and on the streets: “O praise the Lord, all ye nations.” (Psalm 117:1) Public praising accomplishes God’s purpose to divide the peoples and draw out from all nations multitudes more of good-will to the true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How thoroughly’ fitting that representatively’ “all nations” unitedly’ raise their voices in a resounding shout of praise this month 1 December climaxes a year of bounteous blessings: the praise-giving world tour of the Society’s president, heartcheering circuit and national assemblies. new peaks in publishers, and the ever-flowing revelation of satisfying truths through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> Jehovah is good to us, and we are thankful for it. But we are not selfish. We want others to share. We want the world to know of Jehovah's mercy and loving-kindness. And ior that reason we will not seal our lips, but open them in a stirring song of praise during December, a month that might easily witness a new high in publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaching Another Peak In Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do we have sound basis for assuming a new peak in publishers is possible? Last December C9.786 publishers were in the field. In April the figure climbed to 73,512, the largest number ever to turn in a report. Ninety-three thousand persons associate with companies in the United States. Upward of 40,000 back-call book studies are conducted regularly. Do you not agree that out of this throng of more than 100,000 there are at least 74,000 willing to give public praise this month? How, then, can the new high be reached?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How many inactive ones associate with your company? How many book studies are conducted with persons who know the truth, but do not publish? Will you servants immediately make a careful check of the publisher's record card file, and plan to aid every inactive one and every irregular publisher? Will you regular publishers and study conductors lend your needed help? Will you to whom assistance may be offered respond warmly to a kind, considerate invitation to join in praise? Will everyone holding book studies with new interest who have a basic understanding of the Bible ask if they are willing to “come” along and share in praise, if only by simple handbill distribution in public meeting work? If your answer is unanimously yes, and translated into prompt action, we feel confident the effort will be richly’ rewarded, even with a possible peak in publishers.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">At each service meeting during December, a progressive report of the company’s field activity should study and company book study to share in praise. Encourage and help brethren of ‘’all nations” to serve actively’, for language is no barrier to praising Jehovah. And be sure that eacli publisher turns in a report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Arrange now for special field service during the Christmas holidays, when many’ will be released from school and secular employment. Use this time wisely, to the glory of Jehovah and his true Christ, and thus defeat the Devil’s disguised purpose to seduce all nations to give praise that day to a false christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Printed Instruments for Praise</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Three books overflowing with Bible truths vill serve as each publisher's printed instruments of praise. Offer the three on a contribution of $1.00, including </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let Clod Be True&quot; </span><span class="font2">(but not </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every flood Work”)</span><span class="font2"> in each combination. Their silent pages will speak forth God’s purposes, and may activate grateful readers to open their lips in public praise. Be sure to note placements on the House to House Record, for return calls. Diligently give your initial witness and follow up every opportunity. Above all, get into the field, and know that Jehovah will bless your zealous effort, to his praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">December may be cold in many sections. Freezing temperatures, however, should not numb our lips into speechlessness. Lovers of righteousness respond just as warmly in December as in June. They yearn for truth and freedom. Give it to them, you praisers of the Lord of all nations. Give it by giving public praise to your Maker, in “the midst of the city”. Everyone during December, “both young men, and maidens; old men, and children, let them praise the name of the Lord” Jehovah!</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">Beginning January 1, 1948. pioneers may obtain regular supplies of literature from the company nearest them. This arrangement will reduce the number of pioneer orders filled from this office and give the pioneers immediate access to ail publications the company may have in stock. It will mean, too, that pioneers will not have to carry large supplies of literature, as many would when placing 100-pound orders with the Society. It must be understood, however, that this arrangement is not obligatory upon either pioneers or companies. If a company is not in i position to stock sufficient literature, or if it is inconvenient for pioneers to obtain literature from a company, pioneers may order direct from the Society. Much work and much expense to the Society will be saved, if pioneers obtain their supplies from a company whenever possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Company anil stock servants will, i of necessity, have to ascertain the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">pectcd to draw from the literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">being ordered. Pioneers will obtain literature at the designated times when the stock room is open, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">must always pay cash</span><span class="font2"> at pioneer rates at the time the literature is obtained. The Society will supply Pioneer Cost Lists to stock servants and accounts servants upon request, so that they will be acquainted with pioneer rates. Stock servants will place literature at such rates only to such persons known unquestionably to be pioneers. The company will not at any time extend credit to pioneers. If a pioneer desires credit, he must order literature direct from the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Upon request by companies the Society will send a year's supply of Literature Credit Request forms, two copies of which are enclosed with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> Once each month the company will make a request for credit to be applied to its account covering the difference between pioneer and company rates for the literature supplied to pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Recording Pioneer Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When a pioneer obtains literature, the publisher's order blank will be filled out in duplicate, showing the pioneer’s name and marked “Pioneer” at the top. The quantity of each item obtained will be listed, and the pioneer will pay the stock servant pioneer rates for the literature. The publisher’s order blanks for this literature should be kept separate from the company publisher blanks. The accounts servant who receives the money and duplicate blanks from the stock servant will enter the money in the literature account in the regular way. but will keep the blanks separate. All literature placed will be recorded as moved, on the progressive inventory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When a pioneer obtains </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cash items,</span><span class="font2"> which the company received from the Society, the order blanks will be handled the same as outlined, and monies for these will be entered by the accounts servant in the cash account. Then sufficient money should be taken from the literature account to cover the difference between pioneer and company rates for the items and entered in the cash account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Requesting Credit</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the end of the month the stock servant will total from his pioneer publisher’s order blanks the number of books, Bibles and booklets, as well as any cash items, placed at pioneer rates. The accounts servant will also total his copies to see that no discrepancy exists. The quantities will then be placed in the proper spaces on the Literature Credit Request form, two copies of which will be made out. Any cash items placed will be itemized separately. Items where the pioneer and company rates are the same will, obviously, not be listed. The names of all pioneers and servants to the brethren who obtained literature for that month should be listed on the reverse side of this form, which should then be checked, signed and sent to the Society. Upon being received at this office the names listed will be checked against our records to see that they are pioneers. When everything is found to be in good order, the company account will be credited and a credit memo sent to the company for entry in the “Debit” column of the literature account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers Desiring Credit</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Credit balances on pioneer accounts at the Society's office will not be transferred to any’ local company to be drawn upon by’ the pioneers. All pioneers who wish to avail themselves of any special Society credit given to pioneers, or credits due to cash remittances to the Society, must order literature direct from the Society as long as such credit exists. Subscriptions may also be charged to such credit balances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In some instances a pioneer may obtain a supply of literature from a company without the cash transaction through the transfer of stock arrangement outlined elsewhere in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> However, each individual transfer must be authorized by the Society, and this provision is not made for regular usage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If a pioneer leaves the pioneer service he will </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font2"> be permitted to return his literature to the local company and receive pioneer rates for the literature. In every case he must either make out a Transfer of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Stock or request a revision of rates covering all literature he has on hand received at pioneer rates. The pioneer deals with the Society in caring for this literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We believe this new arrangement will be a convenience to the pioneers and also a great assistance to the Society in saving both work and shipping expense: and the co-operation of all is much appreciated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Preparation as an organization and individually is a prime requisite to a successful </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign. Therefore, servants, take notice ! Advertising servants should order sufficient distributor copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> to meet campaign needs. When increasing distributor copies please use the Magazine Distributors’ Order Blank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to preparing booklet combinations, stock servants will ascertain the booklets needed for the campaign. If it is necessary- to replenish your stock, bear this in mind: Before ordering from the Society be sure to check with near-bycompanies. If they are overstocked with booklets, supplies may be obtained from them. The servant to the brethren may lend his assistance in this, as he is familiar with company literature supplies in the circuit. If you cannot obtain the necessary stock from adjacent companies, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">then</span><span class="font2"> order from the Society. (See campaign letter for instructions on redistributing and ordering booklets.) With close company-cooperation most of the 17 million booklets in stock thiouybout the country will receive widespread d’s'ribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Territory servants should plan systematic coverage of company territory with the offer, giving particular attention to territories not recently worked. Back-call servants will carefully arrange th? twofold back-call activity. Assistant company servants will be diligent to supply the names of inactive and irregular publishers to book-study conductors and other regular publishers so that aid maybe offered these weaker brethren in Kingdom service. Accounts servants will prepare to handle the subscriptions as publishers submit them, and will post on the information board i a list of foreign languages in which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font2"> is available.

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Transfer of Stock</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Occasionally- it is necessary for literature to be transferred between pioneers and companies. To clarify procedure in effecting such transfers. the following details are given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society provides Transfer of Stock forms, and one form will be supplied upon request for each transfer authorized by the Society. When making request for a Transfer of Stock always inform the Society’s office of the name of the pioneer or company to vhom the transfer is to be made ami the approximate value of tl-.e literature being transferred. If the account of the company or pioneer receiving the literature is in good standing, the So-e’ety will supply one Transfer of Stock form au-horizing the transfer of literature. The total quantities of books, Bibles and bookk ts to be transferred tliould be listed in the spaces provided. All forei n language publications should be included in these amounts.</span></p>

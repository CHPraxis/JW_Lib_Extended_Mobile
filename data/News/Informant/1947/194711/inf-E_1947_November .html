<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishing Jehovah’s Reign Among the Nations </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Let God Be True” Distribution Continues</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls and Public Meetings Pushed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah has begun his reign, but the nations are woefully ignorant of that fact. Consequently, those who do know it are duty-bound to “publish Jehovah's reign among the nations”, and this they are determined to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Let God Be True” Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During November, publishers of Jehovah’s reign swing joyfully into the second month devoted to the distribution of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let. God Be True”.</span><span class="font1"> To many this will mean working in territory that has already been covered with this offer. The initial presentation at the doors, therefore, becomes more important. It is not the book’s being “new” that prompts its acceptance by the householder, but rather the interest created by the publisher’s efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Approach each door with something definite in mind. A lew sentences full of thought, varied to meet changing conditions, far surpass an oft-repeated recitation that</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Organization and Support Necessary for Success</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In apostolic times ‘churches in houses’ functioned as centers for Bible education and gospel-preaching. Today the home company book study, in addition to Kingdom Hail meetings, can likewise serve as an effective center for vital Bible education and Kingdom service. Necessarily efficient book-study organization plus wholehearted publisher support is required to achieve tlie desired result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Organization Needed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each company should organize at least one company book study, while larger companies will form several in suitable locations. Appointed study conductors, selected for service in different sections, are expected to give diligence to their assignments, preparing for lively, educational meetings and generally assuming the same responsibilities as any servant. By zealous field service and regular assistance to others in the group, study conductors serve as examples to their brethren, and share in advancing the expansion program of the company locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Organize for field service by planning midweek group witnessing, evening house-to-house or back-call work, and booklet activity prior to the study. Co-operative back-call book-study ministry, using good publishers to train others in home Bible education, will yield its reward In more studies and, undoubtedly, more publishers. The public meeting campaign, also, provides soon becomes dull and lifeless. That means alertness. Watch the response and change your approach when necessary. Illustrate the value of the book by using it to answer the questions that arise. Reading a list of chapter titles will not create as much interest as will pointing out the significance and importance of the material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls Fill Need</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Importance of the Company Book Study</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Each book placed is a prospective book study. Let the people know of your concern for their getting the most possible benefit from their new Bible help. L<sup>7</sup>rge them to make note of any questions, so that they may be answered later. Furthermore, the opportunity for starting a study may arise unexpectedly among persons already having the book. They have it? Fine! Bring up timely questions and demonstrate how they can be answered from its pages. We are not merely interested in placing more literature. With this understood, many will react favorably to the suggestion that they learn opportunity for week-end preaching in collaboration with the entire company. Thus, with field work high-lighted, the study proves itself a center for Kingdom service. Brief announcement of plans for the week as well as company meetings may be made at the conclusion of the one-hour company book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Occasional service meeting reports dealing with the progress of company book studies will be helpful to all as study conductors and servants unite their efforts to better local organization of this important branch of company ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Publisher Support Required</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Successful functioning of tlie company book study requires hearty support of publishers. Attend regularly, and try to be on time. Take part in the study, and contribute to its animation and instructiveness. Plan to share in field service with other attendants. And bring to the company study your good-will interest. Here they benefit not only by the truths discussed, but by intimate association with a congregation of clean, joyful worshipers of the true God. With ease they become acquainted, experience the blessing of Christian fellowship, and begin to crave the regular companionship of Theocratic servants. Make them feel “at home”, and invite them to other meetings, as well as into the field of active service. In the small bookstudy assembly, moreover, occasion is afforded to comment more often in the presence of others. Through this medium publishers are strengthened through systematic study. Enthusiasm and wholehearted belief in Jehovah’s reign will aid you greatly in making known the need for knowledge, and then to fill that need through home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings Advance</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Persons who have already manifested some interest are most likely to attend public meetings. The need for such increases as more “sheep” are found. Now is the time to make preparations and line up halls for the coming winter months. Endeavor to get a handbill for each talk of the series into the hands of all persons. The handbill itself gives an effective witness. This is evidenced by the many inquiries that come into the office from people who have read them. The gratifying results of the public meetings provide ample proof that Jehovah is using that means, together with home Bible studies, to announce that he reigns. Be in the forefront of the swelling ranks of ‘the great company that publish it’!—I’s. &lt;58: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">to speak up at the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">study and service meeting, adding to the liveliness of these congregational studies. Support your company book studies energetically, with benefit to yourself, people of good-will, and the entire company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Publications for Study</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Publications to be studied are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”, “The Kingdom Is at Hand,” “The Truth. Shall Make You Free.&quot;</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Flew World </span><span class="font1">Upon completion of one book, study another of these four. Review of the contents will never be uninteresting ; rather, it will refresh and enlighten and edify, as Jehovah's kingdom truths are more solidly implanted in mind, and the student is fitted for better service. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> of course, is considered at the weekly </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study, while </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work” </span><span class="font1">is taken up at the Theocratic ministry school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Company book study, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">study, service meeting, Theocratic ministry school, public meetings, field service and personal study— what a compact weekly schedule! Truly it is a schedule designed to keep us close to the Theocratic organization, fully absorbed daily in the service we so dearly love, a schedule to help us ward off demonic attacks, and learn now to live forever in the New World. Take advantage of these provisions of the Most High, and give them your support, including that center of Bible education and New World service, the company book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare for 1948 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Companies and pioneers should now begin preparing for the 1948 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign, which will be from January through April. The offer will be a year's subscription for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> for 81.00, with a gift offer of eight booklets. These booklets will be made up of four 32-page and four 64-page booklets, where supplies allow, and will be wrapped In a special attractive wrapper provided by the Society. Where </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> is not obtained, the alternative offer of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> will be presented along with the gift of booklets. If this is not accepted, publishers will drop to a bound book, or offer the eight-booklet combination on a 25c contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Companies should prepare now, arranging for additional distributors’ copies of magazines as advised elsewhere in this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font1"> A separate letter is being sent with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> to all companies and pioneers advising them how to re-distribute supplies of booklets already in stock in companies and what booklets may be ordered from the Society, where needed. This letter should receive careful attention by the servants Involved, so that everyone will be ready to start January 1, 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Distributors’ Copies</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are glad to advise that sufficient paper has been obtained to allow supplying increased number of distributors’ copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font1">as well as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> to Branches, companies and pioneers. Wherever additional copies are needed, requests for increases should be sent to the Society on the Magazine Distributors’ Order Blank. Order only wiiat you can actually use, since paper is still hard to get and expensive. Do not waste magazines. Advertising servants should check with pioneers and company publishers now and ascertain their needs for the coming </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font1"> Campaign. so that increases may be ordered accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Ministry School Information</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> is the 1948 schedule for the Theocratic Ministry school. So that all may be able to check reading assignments and time of written review, one is being sent for each publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Note to School Servants : Since you are to check that all points covered in the written review are brought out in the Instruction talk or, if overlooked, in the oral review the following week, the written review material is sent you three weeks before tlie date of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">first </span><span class="font1">lesson. If you have not received your supply by the time of the first lesson advise the company servant, so that he may write at once for your supply. Do not wait until the week of the written review.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Praise-giving Nations” Testimony Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Three-Bound-Book Offer to Be Featured in December</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Peak of Publishers Possible if All “Sing Praise”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">We owe Jehovah our praise, “for his lovingkindness is great toward us.” He has so arranged that only those who recognize this debt of gratitude by service of praise will receive still more blessing at his hand, namely, eternal life. Therefore this call to praise Jehovah is the life-giving call to the nations and nothing is more important than it. Those who refuse to heed this call and who continue to give their praise to the work of men’s hands will suffer destruction together with their idol. But while the United Nations engages in this folly, there are a few from all nations that are unselfishly united as the “Praisegiving Nations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Three-Bound-Book Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the “Praise-giving Nations” Testimony Period we will have a part in extending the lifegiving call to all who will hear, by presenting three bound books on a contribution of one dollar. Having given those in the rurals an opportunity to obtain the bound books in combination, we will now give to those living in the cities a similar opportunity, with this exception, that the Bible handbook </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;</span><span class="font1"> is not to be included. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font1"> should be offered in every combination. In presenting the offer arouse interest by asking questions on particular subjects. For instance, on the chapter heading “Satan the Devil”, such questions as these may be asked: Who made the Devil ? Would a good and righteous God make such a wicked creature? Why doesn’t God kill the Devil? He is almighty and certainly could; etc. Such reasoning will arouse interest in thinking people and will result not only in placing the books but in their getting the answers when reading them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">December always brings with it additional opportunities for praising Jehovah, due to the holiday season. Make good use of the temporary release from school and secular work by bringing to the people the good news of Jehovah’s loving-kindness during this season. Make definite arrangements for group witnessing, particularly on the 25th, thereby furnishing the necessary impetus for united action on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Aid Others to Give Praise</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Having placed some literature with the householder, be sure to call back. Calling back is the first step toward book studies, and book studies result in publishers. And, after all, that is our goal. Having started a book study, tactfully prepare them for field service by recounting to them, as opportunity affords, the joys of service, and the blessings and interesting experiences you are having. Be bubbling over with the joy of praise, and as time goes on they will want to share that joy and will doubtless ask you how they may have a part in it. However, should they fail to do so, take the initiative yourself. As you note their progress suggest that they come along with you and see firsthand the blessings that come with extending the life-giving call to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And while aiding such to get into the service let us not overlook our neighbor in the company who may be in need of help. Each company should be fully organized for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let every company servant arrange for the names of the weak, irregular and inactive ones to be given to book study conductors, other servants and reliable publishers, so that each such one will be given assistance. Let none begrudge the time involved or be annoyed at any inconvenience that may result from extending a helping hand, but rather rejoice in the privilege in advancing the praise of Jehovah. Practical demonstrations at service meetings, preferably based upon actual experiences, showing how this may be done, will go far in making such efforts successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Why a Peak of Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the calendar year of 1946, December was the best month. Without a doubt, effective organization and making good use of the opportunities the holidays presented had much to do therewith. We can do the same this year. If we do, it will mean an all-time peak of publishers for this land. Other lands have seen great increases, as noted by the reports of the president of the Society appearing in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Wateh-toicer.</span><span class="font1"> The Lord is not partial in bestowing his blessings. He blesses faithful and diligent service with increase. And while December may bring with it more inclement weather, let us not be like the sluggard who uses the cold as an excuse for not plowing, but seize the opportunity to demonstrate that our love is perfect. So, regardless of obstacles, let us do our part by extending the life-giving call to as many as possible and aiding all we can to have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> share therein. The Lord will give the increase. Praise ye Jehovah I</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Quota for the United States</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The above report lists the new quotas for the service year from September 1947 through August 1948. It represents an increase of ten percent over the monthly average of publishers for the past service year for both pioneers and company publishers. No separate quota is being given for the number of special publishers, for the following reasons': Keeping up the quota of special publishers depends primarily upon the amount of “Good Hopes” available for this purpose. Their number is decreasing in this country, due to the great expansion work being carried on in other lands. Therefore, when special publishers go to Gilead and then to their foreign assignments, they are not replaced on the United States special publisher list. Consequently this branch of the</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Eastern Convention Arrangements</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Complete Your Plans Assist Good-Will to Attend</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The “Song of Praise” Assembly of Jehovah's witnesses, November 21-23, at Philadelphia, is drawing near. All brethren planning to attend should by this time have sent in their Room Request Forms and made known their desires with regard to transportation. If you have not mailed your request for a room, please do so at once, in order to receive your assignment before leaving home. In the event you do not receive your room assignment by mail, call for it at the Rooming Department, as it will be held there for you. The Rooming Committee will be located at the right of the auditorium lobby beginning Friday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the service meeting prior to tlie convention some time should be devoted to a discussion of point No. 6 on the Room Request Form stub, showing how the brethren can effectively take advantage of the opportunity to witness to the landladies, presenting the current literature offer. Have in mind that many of the persons volunteering rooms are people of good-will; and all are to some extent favorably inclined toward Jehovah’s witnesses and their work. You can help or retard their progress by the manner in which you treat them while attending the convention. Show them kindness and consideration, and, by all means, contact your landlady if you have been assigned definite rooms, even if it is impossible to take such rooms. Deal with the landladies as you would with persons of goodwill on your back-calls, being careful to do nothing that might stumble them or prejudice them and thus close their ears to further preaching of the gospel. Please remember that they have gone out of their way to prepare for your arrival and to have you in their homes; return the kindness by accepting the rooms assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Points to Note</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caleteria.</span><span class="font1"> The Society will do the I best it can to feed as many brethren service in the United States will continue to decrease for the present. However, there is no limit to the number of general pioneers that may be enrolled.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The Company Quotas</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Each company will set its quotas on the basis of a ten-percent increase over its average monthly report of last year, as noted in the instructions sent with the chart. This quota, and not the one appearing in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> should be entered on your chart. By each company’s meeting its own quota, the quota for the country as a whole will be met.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The September Report</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">A check of a number of companies reveals that the reason that the month of August was not another “best respective month” (although failing to be reported such by only a few hundred publishers), was that the publishers failed to report, not that they failed to get into the field service. Doubtless this was overlooked, due to convention activity. This emphasizes the importance of reporting I However, in September, it seems, we had gotten back into swing again, as it was another best respective month, and that by more than five thousand publishers. If we keep up this good work we shall meet our quota for 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">as possible with the facilities available at Convention Hall. Your cooperation with ushers directing cafeteria traffic will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Field Service.</span><span class="font1"> This department will be located in the Exhibition Hall under the main auditorium or arena. Here there will be available literature, magazines, handbills, placards and territory for the field work. Brethren should bring a supply of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font1"> with them. Captains will turn in a daily report, and each publisher will report to his respective company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Immersion.</span><span class="font1"> An immersion will be arranged for Saturday morning. All candidates therefor should bring their bathing suits and towels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Music.</span><span class="font1"> The Society’ is planning to have an orchestra if satisfactory arrangements can be made with the unions. Those desiring to bring instruments may do so, and they should inquire at the Volunteer Service counter regarding details when they arrive. All publishers should bring their Kingdom songbooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneers.</span><span class="font1"> Meal tickets for pioneers will be available at the Pioneer Booth in the lobby entrance of the auditorium beginning Friday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trailer Camp.</span><span class="font1"> Brethren are not encouraged to bring trailers or tents. The regular commercial facilities for accommodating such are very meager in and about Philadelphia, and the Society will not operate a trailer camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Transportation.</span><span class="font1"> The 30th Street station of the Pennsylvania Railroad is about one mile from Convention Hall. Brethren arriving at this and other railroad and bus depots will be able to obtain information about the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Volunteer Service.</span><span class="font1"> The Volunteer Service counter will be located in the Exhibition Hall beneath the main arena. All persons wishing to assist with convention duties should report to this counter immediately upon arrival Friday morning. Any brethren arriving in Philadelphia on Thursday can volunteer their services at 1343 W. Venango Street and thus be assigned to duty before the convention gets under way. Companies already having received volunteer service slips should forward these immediately to the convention committee in Philadelphia. The committee is especially interested in hearing from union craftsmen at once. Many ushers and other servants will be needed, including cafeteria workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every person attending the convention should have part in advertising the public talk to be given by Brother Knorr at 3 o’clock Sunday afternoon. The subject will be “Permanent Governor of All Nations”, which was so well received by the public at London and Los Angeles. Bring your people of good-will to the assembly with you and start them in the service. They will delight to have part in the advertising work. Invite the landladies to Convention Hall for all sessions, particularly for the public lecture. Philadelphia needs a good witness to the Kingdom, and this is the opportunity to praise Jehovah’s name among the inhabitants of that city as never before. Take full advantage of this provision of the Lord for spiritual refreshment, and join in the ‘song of praise’ to his name.</span></p>

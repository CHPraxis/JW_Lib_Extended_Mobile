<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Break Forth on All Sides in August’s Expansion Program</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">No longer is the gospel-preaching activity of Jehovah’s witnesses confined to certain limited sections of the globe, but, as shown from Brother Knorr’s reports on his visits to earth’s far-flung outposts, “all nations” are included. Zion breaks forth on the right hand and the left, and the ‘cities' that once were desolate are now inhabited, as portrayed by the prophecy of Isaiah at chapter 54: 2. 3, our service text for August. There </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">shall be no end</span><span class="font4"> to this marvelous increase, but in order to have a personal share therein everyone has a specific part to perform. How, then, as individuals and companies of those whom Jehovah has chosen as his own, can we join in the “All Nations Expansion” program during the month of August?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Incentives for truly enthusiastic Kingdom activity in the “All Nations Expansion” Testimony Period are so unusual and stimulating that ail will be very anxious to lift up their voices in public testimony to Jehovah at least some time during the month. Just consider August's opportunities. First we have the eventful Los Angeles convention to which to look forward. Then we have before us the privilege of joining with all our brethren throughout the earth in an “All Nations Expansion” program of all features of Kingdom service. Finally we have as a most timely admonition an inspiring and animating </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">article for our consideration in August, which puts before us the necessity of faithful continuance on Jehovah’s side of the issue. The article entitled “Endurance That Wins” will arouse all who love the Lord to appreciatively uphold his true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nobody can soberly consider these matters and remain inactive. Instead, the zeal of Jehovah’s house will fill his people with a burning desire to magnify his name. All attending the convention will be right in the center of activity, but even those who cannot attend may join in the expansion program by putting forth a special effort in their home territory, so that there, also, the invitation may be joyfully extended to all men of good-will to join the everincreasing number of those now coming unto Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Continue Offer of Three Bound Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every company should therefore arrange for special activity during August. Include the name of everyone associated with the company in the outline of service activity for the month. Give the names of the irregular and weaker ones to the servants, book study conductors, and zealous publishers, so that they can call upon them personally and extend a helping hand in bringing them to the company meetings and fieldservice programs. This should make it possible for all to take part in August’s activities and should result in increased service according to the effort put forth. The offer of three bound books, on contribution of one dollar, continues; so make definite arrangements for midweek and week-end group activity, street work, back-calling, and starting book studies, so that all can participate according to the opportunities available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every company that can do so should likewise prepare for a series of public meetings to take advantage of the late summer weather. Let the local possibilities and conditions guide your arrangements, but where-ever possible put on out-of-door meetings in parks, commons, picnic grounds, in rural sections, and in every convenient place. Give the people full opportunity to come and hear this present series of lectures, which certainly contain subjects of great appeal and necessary information to all who love righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">End of a Most Blessed Service Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">August marks the end of the present service year and thus gives still further cause for increased activity. Ever since November, 1946, we have had the best report for each respective corresponding month ever compiled in this country as to number of publishers in the field. By maintaining this glad expansion pace, our quota of ten-percent increase may be attained. It will be the crowning feature of a year specially marked by the favor and blessing of Jehovah, and pave the way for the still more wondrous increase and expansion promised in God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Toward the end of August the conventioners will be returning home laden down with gladness and inspiration. The knowledge and instruction acquired at Los Angeles will first be joyfully relayed to the companies for the edification of the brethren, and then expanded throughout the company territory. Together with our brethren scattered all over the earth, we shall share in Zion’s increase. The prospect of continued and increasing activity in behalf of Jehovah’s righteous cause will not make us grow weary in well-doing, but, on the contrary, energized by Jehovah’s spirit of might and power, we shall cheerfully endure to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">August's special program of public meetings, back-calls, book studies, Street work and door-to-door activity provides everyone with a most practical opportunity to participate in Zion's increase.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Through long, continuous effort the Society lias been able to acquire some additional paper for printing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine. Therefore all companies, pioneers and branches that are in need of additional copies may increase their orders for distributors’ copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> only, according to requirements. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> will not be increased.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Results Gratifying as Assemblies Begin</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Second Time Around</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">As a result of God’s spirit upon the united action of all his servants, district servants, servants to the brethren, pioneers, company servants and publishers, in pushing the Kingdom service along the methods outlined by the Theocratic organization we have had a very remarkable response to the circuit assembly arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of the 93,600 individuals associated with the various companies of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the United States and the 4,692 fulltime servants 61 percent attended the circuit assembly meeting on Saturday evening. A great many more came out Sunday, probably swelling these figures to about 75 percent of the associated; and approximately 97 percent of the average number of company publishers were at that meeting. There were 2,146 baptized at circuit assemblies during the first six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, the actual benefit in the way of assisting those brethren attending the assemblies to care for their Kingdom responsibilities locally is what many are desiring to find out. The returns from the nine circuit assemblies reporting the second time around gives concrete proof of these benefits. These nine assemblies represent approximately 180 companies in all parts of the United States. A comparison of the activities of these companies is herewith submitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The comparison is between the activities at the time of the first assembly and the activities at the time of the second assembly, which took place within the last few weeks. These figures are based on the six months’ activities of these companies preceding each assembly, and hence presents a genuine picture of the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Comparison of the Activity of Companies In the First Nine Circuits</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Throughout the United States Reporting for the Second Time Around</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">First Second Assem- Assembly bly Increase Associated 5,851 6,238 387- 7% Peak Bubs. 4,353 4,872 519-12% Av. Bubs. 3,685 4,120 435 -12% Pub. Meet’gs 827 1,315 488-59%</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few remarks on the outstanding points contained in the above figures will be found edifying and encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Associated (increase 7 percent). You will note that this is a little better than half of the Increase shown for the peak of publishers and average publishers, which indicates that the associated are becoming publishers almost twice as fast as new ones are coming into the company. This shows that emphasis is being laid on the need of each one associating to utilize his tongue in God’s service. However, we must keep in mind that unless new good-will interest is being di</span><span class="font4">rected to the company organization we shall in a short while not have any associated from which to draw. Therefore, let each one give diligent attention to the good-will interest attending back-calls and book studies and aid them to associate with the company as rapidly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Peak ok Publishers (increase 12 percent). This is exceptionally good, and indicates a fine response on the part of the weaker, irregular and inactive brethren to the increased attention and assistance being given by the servants and publishers and which has been stressed at all circuit assemblies. This increase is very encouraging in itself, indicating that these brethren had reported for service one or more times within the six-month period. But when the average number of publishers also increases 12 percent over the same period of time, it reveals to us that the “peak number of publishers” activity is not simply a momentary response to the efforts put forth to assist them, but is a definite forward movement on their part to serve the Lord regularly. These have become regular publishers moved by the holy spirit, and they are determined to ‘redeem the time, for the days are evil’. (1 Pet. 4:1-3) This increase in service activity is cause for deep gratitude on the part of all of Jehovah’s witnesses. We rejoice with our brethren who are joining with us in the joy of service, and we rejoice in the very evident blessing of Jehovah upon the procedure we are following in carrying on his service. We can see clearly before us the road we should follow in our future Kingdom service and are determined to push along that road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Public Meetings (increase 59 percent). This is beyond our fondest expectations. During the first six months of the circuit activity all the companies in the United States reported 15,527 public meetings. A 59-percent increase in that number will bring the total of public meetings up to approximately 25,000, or 50,000 public meetings a year. A mighty shout of praise to the glory of our God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Truly the circuit arrangement is being blessed by the Lord and should be diligently supported by all those who would share in these blessings.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Stock Inventory and August Report</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> are two “Stock Inventory” forms. Each company or pioneer should take an actual-count inventory of stock on hand and fill out the enclosed forms in duplicate, accurately and completely. The original is to be sent to the Society’s office not later than September 4, and the duplicate retained by the company or pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since August will conclude the service year, it is requested that each company and pioneer complete the month’s field service report on August 31, and have it in the mail by September 1.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Means Unselfish Service on Behalf of the “Other Sheep”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As brought to our attention in the text for the month, John 10: 16, A.S.r.. what an aid to faith and obedience is the picture of the Good Shepherd and Ids sheep! In striking contrast with the hirelings and false shepherds of this world, who not only fail to protect the “sheep” but starve, rob and even kill them, the Good Shepherd, Christ Jesus, showed his unselfish interest in the “sheep” by laying down his life for them, that ‘they might have life and have it more abundantly’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who are truly his “sheep” recognize his voice in the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. And, knowing that without his direction they would get lost and that without his care and protection they would soon starve and be at the mercy of wolves and strangers, they heed his voice. How? By following his example in seeking first the Kingdom and telling others about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During September the “sheep” of both folds will heed the Good Shepherd’s voice by pushing forward in the Kingdom proclamation, presenting the special bound-book offer consisting of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”, “Let God Be True”</span><span class="font4"> and one other book, on a contribution of one dollar. This month will wind up the special bound-book rural campaign. Fired with enthusiasm received by attending the National Assembly, or</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Demonstrations Improve Field Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers Instructed in All</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Features by Seeing and Hearing</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Demonstrations of how to do various features of the witness work constitute one of the most practical means of instructing publishers at service meetings. The following suggestions are offered to aid companies in working up more effective and varied demonstrations, with publishers equipped thereby for more efficient service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Everyone at the Glad Nations assembly will remember the house-to-house refutation demonstrations which climaxed Monday’s program. Each was a workable demonstration of what actually happens in field service, witli an equipped publisher refuting objections by use of Theocratic ministry training. They were carefully planned with a definite objective in mind and thoroughly rehearsed in advance. The requirements of all good demonstrations are the same. They must be well planned and rehearsed, have a particular objective to attain and be designed to improve publishers’ Kingdom service. Necessarily each company will base demonstrations on its particular needs or problems which local publishers encounter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Setting the Objective</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Varieties of objectives are almost unlimited. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consider:</span><span class="font4"> Presentations of each campaign offer, overcoming objections in house-to-house witnessing and back-calling; proper conduct of a book study even under adverse conditions; efficient street and store-to-store work, handbill and placard witnessing; getting newly interested persons to attend public meetings, company headquarters meetings, or start out in the service; showing how to apply in the field material studied personally from the Society publications or discussed at any one of tlie company meetings; demonstrating the proper approach in encouraging</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">hearing convention reports, publishers should be able to make the final month tlie best yet. Give September a good start by arranging for group witnessing on the very first day, which is a “holiday&quot; from secular work in many instances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having an unselfish interest in the “sheep” of the Good Shepherd, we will not content ourselves with merely placing literature with them. Far from it! Knowing that such need help to recognize the voice of tlie Good Shepherd, and then instruction as to how they too may heed his voice, we will call back an'd assist these sheeplike ones all we can. That means conducting book studies. If some cannot be continued regularly, show them how they can get this food for themselves by regular family or individual study. Some who have done this consistently have had their diligence rewarded by having good-will persons, whom they found at the beginning of tliis rural campaign, already joining them in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Continue to arrange for, advertise and attend tlie public meetings. The Good Shepherd while on earth engaged in an intensive public meeting campaign, resulting in many “sheep” hearing his voice. Let us bring his voice to the attention of the sheep-j like ones today by this means also. । Heed the Good Shepherd's voice: Follow his example by making September, tlie first month of our new service year, thirty days full of Kingdom activity in all its features.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">weak or irregular publishers into active service. Also, demonstrations might occasionally portray both the improper method and then tlie proper course under a given circumstance, showing the good results of tlie latter. Demonstrations indeed may cover a wide and diversified field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the particular objective has been established it is necessary to work out the dialogue of the demonstration. The brother handling the demonstration will act as chairman and, with the company servant, will make selection of the brothers and/or sisters to be the demonstrators. The chairman and brethren selected should thoroughly rehearse the demonstration, making the material their own. At tlie meeting, the chairman will introduce the demonstration, outlining its objective, and when the demonstration is completed he will sum up the main points established for emphasis. Often in demonstrations where objections are raised the chairman may interrupt at the point of objection and ask those in the audience how they would proceed. After a few comments the demonstration can continue with the demonstrating publisher showing the way it has been planned. A demonstration might have several issues raised and discussed before its completion, or it may consist of several parts showing follow-through, or several short skits, each one covering one point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Gathering Demonstration Material</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4">demonstration</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Abundance of material for producing varieties of demonstrations even with the same objectives is available. It is found in each </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazine, the bound books and booklets, and during discussions at all company meetings. To illustrate: A might show a householder advocating any church denomination as tlie way to salvation. After the audience has had opportunity to comment,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall We Make Our Quota?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The report for June of 71,559 publishers is such as to rejoice the heart of every expansion-minded Kingdom publisher. It is the eighth consecutive best month for publishers, respectively, and that by nearly 7,000 publishers! This gives us a monthly average of 67,847 publishers for our service year thus far, just slightly below our quota of 68,013 publishers. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Shall ice make our quota?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We shall, if each one engages in the field service during July and August and then turns in a report. Do not let the interruption of your regular activity by the convention cause you to neglect to turn in your report, as has been the case with some in tlie past. Surely, regardless of how busy we are, we can devote </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">some</span><span class="font4"> time each month to the field service; and having done so, let us kepokt it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nor should we overlook our obligations to others in this regard. Each company servant should, by the fifteenth of the month, arrange a list of those who failed to report by then, and arrange for some of the servants, study conductors or other active and tactful publishers to call upon these and assist them to get out in the work, or obtain their report if they already have been out in the field. By each one’s doing his part we can even exceed our quota!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">the publisher may effectively refute the claim, using material from the June 1, 1947, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> as a basis. Or, a demonstration can show the practical application of some service instruction given at that very service meeting or perhaps the previous week’s meeting. Actual field experiences of publishers locally or those given in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> may be demonstrated where good points have been established in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An excellent material source is the Theocratic ministry school, and particularly the written reviews, showing the application of that material in field witnessing. The questions raised in the demonstration might be based upon the instruction talk, perhaps student talks of a previous week, or the written reviews. The issues, for instance, might involve authenticity of the Bible, its common divine authorship and its miraculous preservation. The demonstrating publisher can answer with material that happens to be the answers to questions 7, 9, 10, 11, and 15 of the first written review. At the end of the demonstration tlie ' publishers may be advised as to the source of tlie material used, to encourage greater participation in tlie ministry school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Demonstrations are truly most effective because they combine the education medium of seeing and hearing.

<p><span class="font4">The “All Nations Expansion” Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses is rapidly approaching. Many thousands of brethren in the west, and hundreds from the eastern states and Canada, are all set for the trip to Los Angeles. Following are a few points to be borne in mind by all brethren as they proceed to the convention city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Los Angeles is spread out over a large area, and, although the Rooming Committee is endeavoring to give each request the best accommodation, it is impossible to assign everyone a room close to Wrigley Field. The thousands of requests pouring in indicate that this will be a large convention, thus necessitating the assignment of rooms some distance from the convention site. You may have to travel a considerable distance by trolley or bus if you do not have automobile transportation, but the fine program arranged for each day will be well worth the effort. In the past some brethren failed to put in an appearance on the designated day at the homes where rooms had been reserved for them, and some did not go to their rooms at all. This causes difficulty and leaves a bad taste, as it were, because persons of goodwill who are very conscientious about getting rooms ready and making every preparation for your arrival are disappointed. Such does not reflect favorably on Jehovah’s witnesses and the w’ork they are doing. Therefore, the co-operation of all conventioners is requested and all are urged to accept the rooms assigned. When accommodations are assigned to you, the landlady receives a card from the Rooming Committee telling her when you will arrive and how many are assigned to her home. If you cannot be there on the day indicated, please notify the landlady accordingly. Let us be courteous and show appreciation for the kindness of the people in opening up their homes to us. Please accept rooms to which you are assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All brethren staying at the trailer camp should plan to arrive during daylight hours, if possible. Checking in and parking take a little time, and this can be done more efficiently during the day. Highway 101 passes the trailer camp site, becoming Whittier Blvd, in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The many Spanish-speaking brethren attending the assembly will be glad to learn that sessions in the Spanish language have been arranged for Thursday and Friday mornings, August 14 and 15. Other details concerning the convention will be found in the program. This will include two helpful sketches of the grounds and city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before us is a grand opportunity to give a witness to Jehovah’s name and Word, and at the same time be-i come better equipped ourselves to carry out our commission. Those who attend all sessions of the assembly and serve unselfishly in the interests of their brethren and the people of good-will reap the greatest benefits. Participate to the full in the “All Nations Expansion” Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses and rejoice in the good things there brought forth for the edification of His servants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Jehovah’s Christian Witnesses” Testimony Period </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Marks Beginning of Expansive Rural-Witnessing Campaign</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Outstanding Three-Bound-Book Offer to Be Stressed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">‘Unto witnesses chosen of God . . . he commanded to preach unto the people, and to testify.’ (Acts 10:41-43) At the time I’eter spoke these words he was preaching to the people as Jehovah’s Christian witness. He and his fellow servants ceased not to preach and teach the Kingdom in the homes and the streets, in the cities and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rurals.</span><span class="font3"> inviting others to take up the Kingdom-proclamation work. And so in June Jehovah’s Christian witnesses will likewise go forth and “preach unto the people”, not only in the cities, but particularly in the rurals. June marks the beginning of a widespread four-month rural-preaching campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Review May “Informant”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">June will witness publishers carrying forward their rural-witnessing activity as outlined in the article in the May </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> This article provides instructions for effective rural witnessing, public meetings in rurals, planning car groups, and back-calling in rurals. Throughout June and the entire summer campaign these instructions should be constantly reviewed at service meetings and diligently applied during this intensive rural activity. Service meetings should see effective, instructive demonstrations and talks, and also the organizing of groups as outlined in the April and May </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informants</span><span class="font3"> dealing with group witnessing so that everyone possible will be aided to the greatest extent in sharing in the summer rural-witnessing campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Splendid Offer to Be Stressed</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;. “Let God lie True&quot;</span><span class="font3"> and one other bound book, on contribution of a dollar: what an exceptional offer for June! Such beneficial offer should be presented at each door, so that those living in the rurals who have not had a witness during recent years will lie given ample opportunity to take advantage of it. Where the people have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font3"> any other two bound books may be substituted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A convincing and sincere presentation of this splendid offer is essential. By now publishers should have many excellent talking points for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot; </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font3"> as a result of the regular weekly study and the written reviews. Jehovah’s Christian witnesses are armed with a thorough knowledge of the origin, preservation and authenticity of the Bible, as well as an understanding of the birth and growth of Bible languages. As the study of the textbook progresses further information regarding manuscripts and versions will be gained and used. In making the offer, publishers can show parents how these books not only assist them in acquiring a knowledge of the Bible, but are marvelous aids for instructing their children in the Lord. Convincing presentation should be something easily attained by the well-trained Theocratic minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To facilitate the equal distribution of literature available, it has been necessary to cut down some orders for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;</span><span class="font3"> to approximately a two-month supply. If, upon receipt of the invoice, you find this to be true in your ease, it will be well to re-order additional supplies as necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Continued Public-Meeting Progress</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The rural witnessing campaign would Ite incomplete if we did not also extend the public-meeting work to the outlying sections of our territory. With the approach of the warm summer months eiuphasis should be placed on outdoor public meetings in small parks, country villages, fairgrounds, even front yards, as well as halls; in fact, wherever meetings can Ite arranged. (Companies with no rurals also may arrange for outdoor public meetings in the cities.) Do not hesitate to put on outdoor public meetings where possible, for reports show that in many eases attendance exceeds that of indoor meetings and that such are truly a source of Kingdom advancement. Try it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When advertising with handbills in outlying communities, publishers may find that local officials will question the legality of the work, using antiquated and illegal ordinances. This will not stop the alert Kingdom publisher, who knows full well he has Jehovah’s support and the backing of His Word, and that his freedom to worship in this manner is guaranteed by the Constitution and upheld by the Supreme Court. He will be equipped to present a good witness, if the occasion arises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Evening House-to-House Witnessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Evening is one of the best times to meet the people. With the cares of the day lifted from their mind, many are in a meek, receptive mood, ready for the Kingdom message. Hence, evening house-to-house work should not be neglected because it seems impractical to carry it to the rurals. Rather, redeem the time in evening witnessing and handbill distribution in covering small towns as well as city territory. Many brethren have experienced good results from this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The evening house-to-house work has a two-fold purpose: Not only does it afford regular publishers another opportunity to engage in the service, but irregular publishers and inactive persons can be assisted, and new interest Introduced to field activity. Invite your back-calls to accompany you in handbill distribution in the evening. Take them with you to the door. Demonstrate the presentation of the message. Give them practical field instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The coming summer months, including June, are superabounding with privileges of Theocratic service for the publishers. The command of the King is: “Preach unto the people, and testify.” Heed that command and bear witness to Jehovah and prove your claim to the name “Jehovah’s Christian witnesses”.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">April Sees 73,512 in Action!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Previous All-Time Peak of Publishers Eclipsed</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">With keen interest all expansion-minded publishers have awaited the report for April. Would it be the sixth-best consecutive month on record? Would we see a new peak of total publishers for this country? Or would we have to wait still longer to eclipse our peak of total publishers (72,490) of April 1943?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All such now have great cause for rejoicing, for April is the sixth consecutive best month on record and we did attain a new peak of publishers by more than 1,000. Y'es. we are expanding, and to Jehovah goes all the praise. Without his blessing upon the faithful service of the individual publisher and the efforts of servants and other mature ones to aid the new and weak publishers, and without his blessing upon the activity of the servants to the brethren and the circuit assembly arrangement, such expansion would not continue to be realized month after month, “[Paul] planted,</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Company Bank Accounts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">On June 20, 1944, the Society sent a letter to the companies of average size or<sup>-</sup> larger asking for information concerning the companies’ bank accounts, and providing a form for tlie company servants and accounts servants to fill out and return to the Secretary’s Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since then, there have been some changes in check signers, bank used, and other changes affecting this information. and also additional companies have opened up bank accounts. Therefore, any company that has had a change in the information previously given regarding the bank account and has not filled out a new form for the Secretary’s Office, and all companies that have since opened up bank accounts and have not supplied this information, should now do so. In each case the company servant should write to the Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Inc., Secretary’s Office, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, N. Y., stating that there has been a change in the company bank account, or that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font3">bank account has been opened, and request the bank account cards to fill out and return.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah always does his part if we will but do ours. Let us therefore continue to press forward, ever alert to our opportunities and especially that of helping others to have a greater share in the work of expanding the true worship in the earth. Good though our report for April is, there is room for still greater increase, as it still is below our total of regular and irregular publishers. By each and every publisher putting forth the effort, May and June can surpass even April. .Such expansion is bound to result in increased praise to Jehovah and greater joy to ourselves.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“The truth of Jehovah endureth for ever. Praise ye Jehovah.” Y'es, the ever-enduring truth of Jehovah’s Word sounds the call for more persons to learn of and praise Jehovah. To this end Jehovah’s witnesses obtained 294,545 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> during the 1947 four-month campaign. Though the very start of the campaign saw the critical paper shortage prohibit the supplying of sufficient magazines for distribution, brethren everywhere pressed ahead using what they had. and the results are gratifying. Additionally, thousands of renewals have been received, indicating a consistent interest in the magazines on the part of the subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the good work of obtaining these subscriptions, publishers should not think their assignment finished. Call back on all subscribers and endeavor to start home </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> studies so that they will receive full benefit from this most important magazine.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Write Early for Rooms and Trailer Camp Reservations</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As first announced in the March 15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> the national convention of Jehovah’s witnesses will be held in Los Angeles, California, August 13 to 17. Tiie Society has engaged the facilities of Wrigley Field for the occasion, and preparations for a grand gathering of the Lord’s people are under way. By the time you receive this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> a spearhead group of pioneers and company publishers will be preparing for the delegates. Coming as a climax to Brother Knorr’s five-month round-the-world tour of the Society’s Branches and representatives in more than twenty lands, including China, Egypt, Germany, India. Italy and Palestine, it promises to be a joyful and blessed time. Enthusiasm runs high as arrangements get tinder way for this first sizable convention in the West for many years. It is expected that there will' be a 100-pereent attendance of the brethren in the western states, along with many hundreds of people of goodwill, and a good representation of delegates from the states in the eastern part of the country. It will be a time of refreshment in spiritual things, and all who find it convenient to attend at Los Angeles are encouraged to do so. The brethren in the West have long desired a large convention, am] now the opportunity will be afforded to give a good witness in that section of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Do Now</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> a supply of Room Request Forms is being sent to your company. Companies in the West will receive ample forms for all their publishers and persons of good-will; but the brethren in companies distant from Los Angeles who plan to attend the convention should ask the company servant for a Room Request Form. Companies in the East are being sent a limited supply. If more forms are needed, please write the Brooklyn office, marking your letter for the Convention Committee. These forms should be filled out and sent to Watchtower Convention, 106 W. Venice Boulevard, Los Angeles 15, California, as soon as possible, by June 15 or not later than July 1. It will be to your advantage to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">write early,</span><span class="font3"> and it will give the Rooming Committee an accurate idea of how many delegates will be in attendance. Many rooms will be requested, and you want to be sure to get your assignment as soon as possible. Due to the large number of rooms to be assigned, you may not receive your room assignment before you leave home, especially if you write late. In such ease, be sure to call for your assignment at rooming headquarters in Los Angeles. It will be there for yon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The housing situation in Los Angeles is rather difficult, but the Rooming Committee will make every effort to fill your requests and provide you with the kind of accommodations you want. The brethren will be working hard to obtain accommodations for you; therefore, every publisher should assist in avoiding difficulty by accepting the accommodation assigned. Many accommodations are provided by persons of good-will who are very conscientious about putting the rooms in the best possible condition for the conventioners. Therefore, to avoid bad feelings and misunderstandings please go to the room to which you are assigned. Be sure to notify the landlady if you can’t be there on the date specified, so that j she will not be upset by your failure to arrive on time and hence make frequent phone calls to the Rooming Committee. Be certain to write for rooms in advance; don’t wait until you are in Los Angeles and then try to get rooms suitable to you. The earlier you write, the better your opportunity of obtaining what you prefer. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Write for rooms, and write as soon as possible.</span><span class="font3"> Address Watchtoweb Convention, 106 W. Venice Boulevard, Los Angeles 15, California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is arranging to have a trailer camp at Los Angeles, a few miles from Wrigley Field. Space will be provided for the erecting of tents and parking of trailers. Water, electricity and other conveniences will be had in the camp. Write to the Convention Committee for space in the camp for your tent or trailer. The application for trailer camp space is found on the reverse side of the Room Request Form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Supplies of the Application for Volunteer Service form are being sent only to companies in the convention area, and these should be sent to the Convention Committee by company servants not later than July 1. There will undoubtedly be other brethren elsewhere who have skilled trades (such as licensed plumbers, electricians, carpenters, tinsmiths, cooks, sound men, etc.) attending the convention. If such brethren wish to volunteer their services, please write the Convention Committee in Los Angeles regarding your qualifications and what tools or equipment you can bring with you, as well as the date you expect to arrive in the convention city. However, the Society requests that only those pioneers and company publishers who receive official notice proceed to Los Angeles ahead of time. Others will remain in their assignments, earing for the good-will interest and preparing for travel to the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Transportation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Train, bus and car groups should be arranged for now, and the brethren should co-operate with one another in making up groups for trains and special busses. In larger companies, especially those where the majority of the brethren will be going to the convention, the company servant should begin investigating transportation possibilities, extra coaches on trains, chartered bus service, etc., and talk these things over with the servants and brethren assembled. Find out what are the plans of the majority, summarize your transportation problem, and write the Society regarding it by June 15 at the very latest. It may be that you can join special cars or trains from other sections, or that you can be directed to the aid of others en route. Write Watchtoweb Convention Transportation, 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn 1, N. Y. Be sure to address your letter as above; otherwise it may be delayed. Take into consideration the people of good-will in all of these arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> you will find a memorandum on Convention Transportation. The memorandum, along with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> article and the Room Request Form, should be considered at the first service meeting following receipt of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> especially in the western states. Companies in the eastern part of the country should consider this information to the extent neces-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Strengthen Rural New Interest for Praising</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Through Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Stronghearted praisers in and among all nations will continue during July to present to the rural populace the invaluable three-bound-book offer. Even a casual reading of this literature will aid them to “know their Bible”, and to appreciate more deeply God's perfect guide. The chief objective, however, is to make known how they may unite in praise to Jehovah, and gain life. To strengthen our rural friends for praising, thorough Bible education is required, a fact which obliges each publisher to instruct good-will through back-calls and book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The finest instrument at hand for Bible instruction is the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;.</span><span class="font3"> It tactfully but surely roots out of mind demon religion’s baseless doctrines, and implants in their place the authoritative teachings of God. After firm foundation is laid, the final chapter tells right-hearted learners how to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">VACATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order that companies and pioneers may plan their work for about two months of the period affected, they should order literature well in advance of August 9. This instruction is given in view of the information we here give that the Brooklyn factory, office and Bethel home will be closed for the period of Saturday, August 9, to Sunday, August 24, inclusive. This vacation arrangement will allow for some members of the Bethel family who can so order their affairs to attend the national assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in California. August 13 to 17. During the vacation period as little correspondence as possible should be sent to the Society, with the exception of report cards and subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sary to inform the brethren who plan to attend the convention. The proper use of the Room Request Form should be explained to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is only a little more than two months until the convention, so the brethren who plan to attend should get busy with all arrangements. Take with you the people of goodwill from your book studies and give them the privilege of rejoicing in the good things of the Lord's table. Every reasonable effort should be made to aid everyone possible to attend the convention. However, due to the great distances of travel, especially for those brethren in the eastern part of the country, some may find it more advantageous to remain at home and give their undivided attention to the field work in their territories and to the local circuit assemblies. Nevertheless, those who can reasonably attend the assembly are encouraged to do so and participate in its five joyful days of praising Jehovah’s name. Those finding it not possible to attend the western convention this year have the consolation of knowing that a convention has been arranged for the East in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, November 21, 22 and 23, and they rejoice to look forward to this convention and the good tilings the Lord has in store for them there. Surely Jehovah's arm is not shortened and He provides bountifully for the needs of His people I </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">serve</span><span class="font3"> the true God, while the spirit of the Lord makes them stronghearted for active service. Undoubtedly many future publishers dwell in rural sections, not worked for some time. They desire and need our help and instruction. Care for them during succeeding months by calling back and studying. Encourage also regular reading of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for L'rei y Good Work&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Rural follow-up activity can be attended to on Sunday and during the week. Diligence in this service may mean the building of a nucleus of publishers able to cover their home territory year-round. Prospect exists also for establishment of company book studies. If just one person in each company’s rural territory in this land were to become active an increase of about 3,000 publishers would result. Our privilege is to encourage their praise of the Most High through constant back-call and book-study instruction. Let us do that, and Jehovah the Increaser will richly bless the effort, internationally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Ministers Highly Appreciative of Latest Aid in Becoming “Equipped for</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Every Good Work”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The present study of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;, </span><span class="font3">with its written tests or reviews, has been thankfully accepted by Jehovah's servants as one of the most important steps to date in their necessary advancement in knowledge of and ability to serve the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some were manifestly timid at taking the initial reviews, but, now that the procedure is becoming familiar, and so many did far better than they expected, each review is being eagerly anticipated. Those eager to make progress as efficient gospel-preachers are finding much joy in attending the Theocratic ministry school and fully entering into this helpful study of the Bible, its authorship, worth, and use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fact that both brothers and sisters, young and old, profit equally by the arrangement is of itself a great incentive for everyone to actively participate therein. All of Jehovah’s servants fully realize the absolute need of training and education in the ministry, and this particular study will bear fruitage in attaining to that degree of ability that marks the mature man of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus equipped, God's able ministers will effectively feed His “other sheep”. No longer can they feel inadequate for this task, but possessed of the necessary training by the aid of God’s spirit they can enter efficiently into every feature of gospelpreaching activity. The increased attendance at the ministry schools testifies to the appreciation of Jehovah's servants for this latest educational aid. All who love God will gladly use it to His praise, to the benefit of others, and to their own everlasting good.</span></p>

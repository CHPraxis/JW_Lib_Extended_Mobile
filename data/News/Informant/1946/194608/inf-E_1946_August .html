<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>“Creator’s Remembrai</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Wonderful Service Oppi </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Every Servant of Jehovah, Remember the Creator in a Mighty Shout of Testimony </span><span class="font2">August, the long-awaited month is now upon us. The time for assembly of God’s people so earnestly prayed for and eagerly anticipated is here, and now the people of God arise, not merely to attend the great assembly, hut to remember their Creator in zealous proclamation of his purposes. What an appropriate admonition we have as our guiding text for the month! At Ecclesiastes 12: 1, Solomon, filled with wisdom and under inspiration, calls upon all those who love the Lord to “remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth [or vigor]”. He shows the folly of waiting until the evil days come or the years draw nigli when there is no further opportunity to gratify the creature's own desires or pleasures, and points out, on the contrary, the wisdom of serving the Creator at every opportunity and with the full vigor of youth. Surely the opportunities that present themselves during August will enable every servant of Jehovah to heed Solomon’s wise counsel. The time is fully ripe, and the occasion never more favorable, to enthusiastically take part in the special booklet campaign which is our service assignment for the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Proceed</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The literature offer for August will still be 10 booklets on a 25c contribution or 4 booklets on a contribution of 10c; and, with 12,000,00(1 of them on hand at the beginning of the campaign, every publisher can be amply supplied for his share in the gigantic distribution. In order for all publishers to grasp the full significance of the campaign, part of the August service meetings should be devoted to demonstrations illustrating the main points of some of the booklets in the company stock, and the most effective ways of placing combinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is not always possible or necessary to describe each booklet when calling at the doors, but show in your demonstrations how the publishers may call attention to the outstanding features of one or two booklets and then make general reference to the entire combination. .Show how, in brief, they point forward to the destruction of present evil conditions by Almighty God and the establishment of his righteous New World. Even the booklets published in earlier years contain a message that will direct the people of good-will with unerring sureness into that New World. Open any one of the booklets you may have in stock and read the foreword or introduction. Take, for instance, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">His Vengeance,</span><span class="font2"> published in 1934. How appropriate in the present evil days are the introductory</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Glad Nations Theocr AU Thoughts Ti</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Are You Ready?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">From all over the earth, from every continent on the globe, the prayers of the Lord's people have been ascending to him, petitioning his blessings upon the arrangements for this great assembly at Cleveland and upon the assembly itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The hearts of God's people everywhere have been centered on that assembly with longing and desire to be there in person, and where that is impossible they will be there in spirit, living through the assembly in their mind's eye. This assembly is going to be very real to them. What would they not be willing to sacrifice to be there!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among the more fortunate are the hundreds upon hundreds from the remote corners of the earth, Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, South America and the isles of the sea, who will be traveling toward Cleveland by every means of transportation available; such as by camel, oxcart, river boat, freighter, tramp steamer, ocean liner, railroad, auto, bus, and airplane—by anything and everything that moves. What do they care about hardship, inconvenience or expense? They are coming to the greatest convention of the Lord's people that has ever been assembled upon this earth 1 They are straining every nerve, expending every resource and drawing heavily upon the Lord for direction, protection and a safe journey to that assembly. What are you doing to be there? August 4 is at the door 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What does this assembly mean? What is there so Important about it? This assembly point is the place where the Lord God of the universe, Jehovah, has called his people to be. It is the place where he will reveal himself and his purposes to his men of lovingkindness. It is the place where the Lord will open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing upon his people such as they will not be able to contain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Appreciating what the Ixird has in store for us we will permit nothing to stand in our way of attending. The Lord has invited us and prepared a feast. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Come and partake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">\ from store to store and on the street. Any and every feature of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">; service will be welcomed by Jehovah's servants as special publishers, general and vacation pioneers and company publishers unite their efforts in taking advantage of the present favorable time to serve. The vacation pioneers will rejoice to know that 462 of them are now enrolled, and they will continue to blend their voices in the loud-swelling chorus of praise during August. Thus the remembrance of the Creator will be observed. No selfish w’aiting until it is too late, but now, in the favorable time and the days of vigor, his faithful servants will energetically show forth his praises.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ice” Testimony Period </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">rtunities During August!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">words by the publisher to the effect that Jehovah will soon express his vengeance against the wicked in vindication of His name. Or, take the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Safety.</span><span class="font2"> It was published in 1937, but the foreword shows what a joy it is to be able to bring a message of real comfort and protection to men who have been deceived by religious lies and false assurances. Are conditions any different at present? Are not the people still comfortless and fear-smitten? Is not the kingdom of God still their only hope?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We could thus continue to describe each one of the booklets. In all of them the message contained is vital and urgent. A special campaign of this nature is not merely a matter of emptying the shelves of literature. The groaning of those under bondage to Satan's dominion increases as the conditions in earth grow worse, and the desperate cry of the “prisoners” goes up for enlightenment as to the only real remedy, Twelve million booklets remaining in storage will not comfort those who mourn, nor will such magnify the name and word of Jehovah. Distribution of them will certainly testify to the remembrance of the Creator. Before the evil days draw nigh, and while they have vigor, Jehovah's servants will rejoice to bear the message of truth to the people because they love Him and His sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Everybody In Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before going to Cleveland, we shall all be extremely busy telling the people of good-will about the convention and inviting them to go. That will be an excellent way of taking part in the booklet campaign, because the people certainly will be glad to obtain combinations of booklets. While going to Cleveland the opportunity will again be afforded to leave combinations of booklets with the many different persons we encounter. At Cleveland, plenty of opportunities will be available. The curiosity of the people there will be aroused as to the reasons that such a mighty throng of jieople would come to their city to worship the Creator, and booklet combinations can be left with them. Coming home, everybody will be so thrilled with what has taken place that it will be impossible to silence the great shout of testimony that will arise. So, from every angle, the evidence points to a most remarkable distribution of booklets in August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Such placements will pave the way for return visits to those manifesting interest, and, under the guidance of mature publishers, many who may have just begun field service by using the booklets can become more able ministers by making back-calls. The street work will not be neglected either. Remembrance of the Creator will also include distribution of the magazines</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>itic Assembly Is at Hand um to Cleveland</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Consideration of Others</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That ‘no man lives unto himself’ will be true of all that attend the Assembly. Each one privileged to go should consider himself a delegate from the Lord to the people of good-will unable to attend, obligated to bring back home to them a complete report of the Assembly and nourishing spiritual food. The Lord will do his part; his blessings will be there. Let us be on the alert and attentive to receive them so that we shall be able to pass them on to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Additionally, let us consider the tens upon tens of thousands of others in attendance with us at the Assembly and broaden our outlook and attitude to include them also in our planning. We should go to the convention not only with the thought of receiving abundant blessings ourselves, but also that of being a blessing to those with whom we come in contact. To do this our hearts and minds must be in tune with the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For months our brethren have been working hard, day and night, to prepare for the convention: supervisors, technicians, clerks and stenographers, pioneers by the hundreds seeking rooming accommodations, cataloguing them, writing to the householders and the brethren, handling an abundance of mail—all under the direction of the Lord to make this convention a blessed and comfortable place for you to come to, and a glory to Jehovah’s name. Let us show our appreciation of these provisions of the Lord by being content with whatever has been arranged for, remembering that, after all, the spiritual feast, both of revealed truths and privileges of service, is the main thing. Co-operate fully and obey all instructions given from the platform. Do what you can to make the assembly a success for everyone. Be also considerate of the people who have so graciously permitted us to enter their homes. In addition to giving them a proper witness of the Kingdom, let your irreproachable course of action and your thoughtfulness of their rights be a witness also. Carry out the instructions given on your room assignment form: contact them promptly upon arrival, advise them if you cannot be there on time, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All such, however, is only the beginning. To fully contribute his share to the success of the convention let each one put his shoulder to the wheel by volunteering for some service, either convention work or field service; and, whatever job you undertake, stick to it. Do your assigned duty. Be dependable. Whether your task be hard or difficult or seemingly small and insignificant, put your mind to it and do it wholeheartedly as unto the Lord. Arrange while in Cleveland to bring someone to the convention, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column</span><span class="font2"> 2)</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font2">As they look back all will agree that it reached an all-time high in spiritual feasting. Really like enjoying life in the New World for eight days, a world under Theocratic rule and free from religion. By the Lord’s grace the Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly will have been a gathering overshadowing by far the typical feast of liberation which Hezekiah ordained many centuries ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yes, it will have taken hard work to go to Cleveland. It will have been good to be there. But, is that all there is to it? Shall we merely dwell on the blissful memories of those eight days and dream of the time when the whole world will be just one grand assembly, with no secular bosses, no hardships, no misunderstandings, no religion? Is that what the Israelites did back there after their feasting? Far from it! They had been l&gt;rimed for action and into action they went. We read: “All Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars.” The Israelites and the &quot;strangers that came out of the land of Israel&quot; actively assumed the responsibilities placed upon them by the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Glad Nations Assembly should effect results no less direct and far-reaching. Stimulated to clearer vision and greater appreciation by this spiritual feast and joyful association, now carry out your responsibility of convention delegate. How? By calling upon all persons of good-will unable to attend the assembly, taking to them a vivid report of the glad association, and extending to them the spiritual food upon which you have previously feasted so bountifully. Just as the Israelites threw down the visible instruments of demonworship which so interfered with proper worship, so now we must purge out religion by throwing down the religious and political idols which at present stand up to hinder the people from knowing God and seeing him in all his majesty and power. This is done by preaching the truth and refuting false doctrines, shouting aloud the glad song of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">September’s Purging</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The offer in September’s purging campaign provides an excellent opportunity for all. Tlie ten-booklet offer which you have been presenting during July and August will be added to by the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”,</span><span class="font2"> or any other bound book of which you have ample supply, and the combination will be placed on a 50c contribution. If you do not have that variety of ten booklets, then present the bound book and the four booklets on a contribution of 35c. Dropping down from this, offer either the book or ten booklets on a contribution of 25c or the four booklets on a 10c contribution. In every offer of the book on 25c contribution or the book and four booklets on contribution of 35c or the book and ten booklets on a 50c contribution, be sure</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ty, particularly booklet work. This feature should be stressed, for the evening is a time when more people are at home as well as being most receptive. Devote every available evening to this work. Take the weaker and new publishers along with you and help them. And remember, with evening booklet work also goes the responsibility to make back-calls where interest is found, without which religion cannot be effectively purged from the minds of the people.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The Back-Call Book Study</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Four hundred fifty million books and booklets in just 25 years! What positive evidence of Jehovah’s blessing! Yet, were the figure 450 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">billion, </span><span class="font2">this in itself would not prove that Jehovah's witnesses had ‘done well’ their work. Why? Because the responsibility that rests heavily upon them is not the mere ‘placing of hooks’, but the feeding and comforting of millions of mourning “sheep”. I The placement of a book is a means to an end. The book, it is true, is a divinely provided instrument designed to aid one in securing essential knowledge from God’s Word.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">Having it. however, is not enough ; understanding its contents is the thing required. This demands instruction from Jehovah's people, who alone of earth’s inhabitants are equipped to teach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is chiefly through the back-call book study that “other sheep” learn the truth. Do you, as an instructor in the Bible, conduct a study? If not, why? Is it that you feel unqualified, due to limited knowledge or natural ability? Is it that you display a ‘negative' attitude, saying, ‘I'm sure I won’t be able to start a study here’?</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to Expand &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Along with clearing up the scattered territory, along with your evening work, there is another feature to our manyfold purging campaign. The public meetings should start rolling again. With the break during the month of August, all publishers should be anxious to get going in this in September. Line up your halls. Prepare your territory. Let September's first Sunday witness a countrywide simultaneous effort in the public meeting campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ijet every publisher support the meetings by street advertising and by personal attendance, bringing the good-will people to the talks. Give the same whole-hearted enthusiastic support that was given the meetings at Cleveland. Those assigned talks should get to work on them right</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">Or are you content with merely ‘talking’ at every return visit, without ever broaching the matter of a book study? How can the goal of one study for each company publisher be reached ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the outset, dismiss from your mind the thought of being ‘unqualified’ ; even a child in the truth knows more about God’s purposes than any religionist. Further, the book study is Jehovah’s arrangement and must be recognized as such. It is his spirit that will unquestionably guide us to his “sheep” (as it led Philip to the Ethiopian) and the opening of a book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With full confidence in the Lord, be on the lookout for book-study possibilities. Pave the way for a study by mentioning at the time you place a book that you may stop in again</span></p>

We plan a post office at the Assembly, but it will be more convenient to get your mail at your rooming address. If you contemplate being immersed, come prepared with bathing suit and towel. Anything found that had been lost by others should be turned in to the “Lost and Found” department; this in. eludes lost children.

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">for ‘just a few minutes’, since they will doubtless have questions on the book. But be sure to call back before the initial interest created has died. When you make the return visit, use discretion. If the person simply cannot take the time, do not antagonize by insisting that he listen. Be pleasant, kind, helpful; for your attitude on the first visits leaves a lasting impression, an impression that may aid or hinder the establishment of a book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Question booklet can be used as an opening wedge in getting studies. Always take it with you. Go through the booklet beforehand, picking out a question here and there that might be appropriate for the occasion (like 63 and 223 in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font2"> Question booklet). On your return visit, produce the booklet as a ‘companion’ to the book, and propound an interest-rousing question. Perhaps they have an opinion on the matter. Let them express it. Then go to the Bible (their copy, if available) and request that they read the text cited. You may have to show them how to handle the Bible ; you may be required to pronounce words unfamiliar to them; at first it may be necessary that you do the reading; but be patient with these “sheep”, for this is part of our educational work. After the text, have the paragraph in the book read as a summary, preferably by the good-will person. In this manner a book study has been started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Through such tactful approach the word “study” does not convey to their minds laborious mental effort, which many abhor, but takes on the meaning of a delightful, informal, appealing question-and-answer discussion of the Bible. Show them, further, that this is free education for life, with a minimum of study time needed each week, in contrast with worldly education, which costs one much time and money and yet offers nothing of permanent value. And, of course, make arrangements to continue the study regularly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The present speaking schedule for student talks in the course in Theocratic ministry runs out at the end of August. For the weeks beginning in the month of September the students assigned to speak will have the privilege of speaking about the Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly. The student speaker may relate his experiences there, his impressions of the Assembly, his reactions to the things that he saw or heard, his assignment of work while there, or anything else pertaining to the Assembly. If the one assigned to speak did not have the privilege of attending, he can easily speak for six minutes on his reactions to reports on it that he heard. The lessons for study will be numbers 64-68.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>150,000 Subscriptions for United States Our Aim</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">What a blessed privilege it is to be alive in this day, and on Jehovah’s side of the world-rocking issue pressing for immediate settlement, the issue of right worship I Can the Almighty God draw to himself without compulsion the unbreakable worship of humans? No ! challenged the Devil, He cannot. But time would tell; and time has told. Down through sixty centuries, repeatedly, has come the answer in favor of Jehovah. There were Abel, Noah, Daniel, and many others of a great cloud of witnesses who stood immovable for the right worship, no matter what the cost. There was Christ Jesus, who under faith-testing temptation settled the issue forcefully when he told Satan, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” Is it different in this day? No; if anything, today the issue is more definitely settled, for today there live on earth not 100, not 1,000, nor even 10,000, but more than 100,000 immovable worshipers, so that more than 100,000 times daily Satan is proved the liar that he is!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Right worship Is not easy. It is not inseparable from work, hard, persistent work for every servant. It means, further, the loss of worldly “friends” and pleasures, the casting aside of many wants and luxuries, as well as self-pride. It means facing persecution, rebuffs at the doors, mobs, jail sentences, ridicule, discouragement at times, and even death. Yes, It means a constant fight against the demons; for the Devil will not cease trying to blot out the true worship, until he himself is obliterated. But, though faced with all this, what worshiper of the Most High wants to quit his ministry and seek after other gods? Where among religious worshipers can you find the peace of mind, the unquenchable joy, and the full satisfaction and freedom that pervades the ranks of Jehovah’s people today? Worship another than Jehovah? Never, says the consecrated servant, as he looks ahead to the New World. But not in our frail selves can we continue firm for true worship; solely by complete reliance upon the invincible might of Jehovah, who backs ns up, will we stand. As the psalmist puts it, “I have set the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font4"> always before me ; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.”—Psalm 16: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Remaining intrenched in our blessed position requires right knowledge. This the Lord provides through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> What would be your reaction if </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> suddenly stopped coming? Would you miss it? The answer is obvious. A deep craving would be set up in our hearts and minds for the vital Kingdom truths which fill its pages. To us </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoucr</span><span class="font4"> is indispensable. It is not the will of God, however, that its message be limited to his present worshipers. To the contrary, Jehovah’s mandate is that ‘this gospel be preached in all the world’, that others may learn of the </span><span class="font5">true worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Do people of good-will comment favorably on the cleanliness and orderliness of your Kingdom Hall? Do they feel so much at home that they want to return? If not, then something should he done about it The appearance of your Kingdom Hall reflects either favorably or unfavorably upon Jehovah’s witnesses and The Theocratic Government, because it is natural for people to judge by outward appearances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Kingdom Hall is to be used to the Lord’s honor and praise and । to bring life-giving knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes to people of goodwill who are served by it It should at all times be clean, tidy, well lighted and ventilated, properly heated and orderly, having no unauthorized signs or slogans displayed in the hall. Every company should, however, if they have not already done so, arrange to have the new yeartext neatly and properly displayed in the Kingdom Hall. Window displays should be changed frequently and the windows kept clean, so as not to resemble some dingy religious mission on a side street. Faded, soiled literature or unsightly signs should not be used. Cleanliness and neatness, which attract favorably the attention of every passer-by, should mark every window display. Better to have no display than a poor one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many brethren are meticulous about the appearance </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> their own homes; but how much more concerned should we be about the appearance of our Kingdom Halls, which are a provision for giving life-education and happiness to all those served by it! The company servant should arrange to schedule willing volunteers to systematically care for keeping the ball clean, neat, orderly, attractive and inviting. They will then know it is part of their responsibility to Jehovah. Arrangements should be made to have the hall thoroughly cleaned, windows washed, furniture dusted and arranged orderly, etc., regularly, so that people of good-will will not feel ashamed to be seen there, hut will receive a good</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Also, there is still some confusion as to how to report back-call book studies; this being particularly the case among some of the general pioneers from whom we receive such in all companies, and should con- reports as 32 back-calls and 30 book </span><span class="font5">tinue periodically throughout the studies.

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Step Up “Watch</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“I have given him for a ... commander to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">people.”—Isa. 55:4</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the month of February, we have a testimony period of great importance: the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Commander's”</span><span class="font4"> Testimony Period. Not only is this of great importance to the Lord’s people, but it is of vital concern to every creature on the face of the earth. The demand for, the desire for, and the need for a Commander was never so great as it is now. All realize the need for such leadership. Numerous “commanders&quot; have been selected, but none of them have been entirely satisfactory, even to those who selected them. And, on the whole, they have left the people in general thoroughly disappointed, discouraged and disillusioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The motive that prompts the desire for such leadership varies according to the heart conditions of the people. The ultraseifish politicians, financiers and ruling clergy want a “commander” of their own choice, who will recognize and accept them and keep them in power. The deluded and blinded peoples of the world, who blame all their troubles on demonized human leaders of the past and present, want a “commander&quot; who will wreak vengeance on their enemies, and exalt themselves to a position where they may enjoy the fruits of their so-called “victory”. The meek people of the earth, who are sick of war and its attendant bloodshed, are feeling after and hoping for a righteous condition. They want a “commander” who will bring about these conditions for themselves, their loved ones, and all mankind. These are really ‘feeling after God, if haply they may find him’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The People with Vision and Responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The only people on earth who can really evaluate the situation that exists today and who discern the true reasons for the failure of all human commanders and the only effective remedy for man’s present condition are the witnesses of the Most High God. They know who the real “Commander” is, and why the selfish desires of the wicked will be shattered, and how the longings of the meek and teachable will be realized. This knowledge is a gift of God, and not of themselves. They are, therefore, responsible to the Lord God to use it according to his direction. In fact, they are made of the Lord signposts to direct the people in the proper course. This knowledge and responsibility separates them from all other peoples of the earth. They are a people for a purpose; which purpose they must fulfill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The delusions of the adversary, minimizing the true “Commander” and magnifying all other commanders, are snares and pitfalls set out to entrap the people and keep them from recognizing and submitting themselves to the Lord's appointed Commander. The Lord knows this, and, centuries ago, made the necessary arrangement to counteract the schemes of the Devil. Through His Word lie outlined the proper course of action to be taken by his people in order to fulfill their part in his grand arrangement. All of His people, whether anointed or Jona-dabs, are. because of the knowledge they have, obligated to gather out these obstructions developed by the Devil and intended to thwart the purposes of Jehovah. In Isaiah 62, verses 6, 7, and 10 (A.S.F.), the Lord says to his witnesses: “I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">iniony Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that are Jehovah’s remembrancers, take ye no rest, and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast ; up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up an ensign for the peoples.” This commission every anointed and Jonadab who has a knowledge of the Lord’s purposes is obligated to carry out to the best of his ability, and, by the Lord’s grace, each and every one who really has the spirit of the Lord, will do his part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Divinely Provided Instrument</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No better instrument can be used for this purpose than the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine, with its divinely directed message that destroys the barriers and obstructions of the enemy and lifts up a standard of truth and makes the highway of the Lord passable to the people of goodwill. Twice every month this magazine comes to the homes of the people loaded down with treasures from Jehovah, comforting, soothing, and life-giving. The dollar subscription rate that they give for the magazine in no way compares with the comfort, hope, and blessing that It brings to them. Every witness must realize that there is no comparison between the small subscription rate for the magazine and the value of the message it contains. We should present the message with conviction and sincerity, assured of this, and in presenting it realize that we are bestowing upon the people the greatest opportunity for a blessing that they have ever received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Go After the Isolated and Scattered</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is considerable territory in every company assignment and in many pioneer assignments that has not been reached during the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaigns in recent years. A definite effort should be made to give this territory a thorough coverage this year. Plan now to reach these people during February, and continue working until all of them are reached. These people have been neglected not only in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">campaigns, but also in the public meeting campaign and other features of the Kingdom service. See that they are thoroughly served this winter through the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower </span><span class="font4">Campaign, public meetings, back-calls, and book studies. Follow through in all features of the work. Let each one take this assignment of ‘gathering out the stones’ very seriously. It is from the Lord, and all must answer to the Lord for their faithfulness in discharging their obligations. Plan now to care for all the good-will interest in the territory, that they may know and accept Jehovah’s “Commander to the peoples”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Regular Attendance at All Company Meetings Very</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Essential in These Evil Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two classes will eventually emerge from the dividing of the nations now in progress, both definitely marked, one for and one against the Lord. Those on Jehovah’s side will comprise a class of men taught of him and firmly knit together in unity of thought and action through constant association in study and Kingdom service. They will stand entirely separate from the old, evil world. Thus the absolute need for regular attendance at the company headquarters’ meetings for study and cooperative action becomes clearly apparent. The Kingdom Hall becomes the rallying point where those seeking the New World come together to learn of and to walk in the way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order for a company to function efficiently, everyone in the vicinity who loves God and has agreed to do his will needs to attend all company meetings, to be completely equipped for an effective ministry. There is spread the table of the Lord with food convenient and necessary for</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Your Theocratic Library</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Theocratic library plays an important role in every Theocratic school. It contains much or all of our Kingdom instruction and educational material and can be a source of real Theocratic aid to every Kingdom publisher. There is no good reason why every company cannot have a good, usable, practical library for the use of all the Kingdom publishers and persons of good-will associated with the company. The company servant and school servant should arrange for an up-to-date, neat, clean, practical library, and show all of the publishers how to get the most good out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Theocratic library should contain all of the Society’s publications, or as many as are available, including books, booklets, Bibles, magazines, etc. It should have as many translations of the Bible as are obtainable, for comparative study. Exhaustive concordances, Bible dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference books are also valuable assets to the library. You may also include books by recognized authorities for the purpose of refutation in talks. Do not include books which delve into religious interpretations, higher criticisms, or religious commentaries, of which ‘books there is no end; and to study them ' is a weariness of the flesh’.—Eccl. 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This Theocratic library may be used by all publishers in gathering material for back-calls and book studies, or for Improving their door-to-door presentations; in further research when studying </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and books, or to gather more information on some Scriptural point that is not clearly understood. Public speakers and student speakers will find it a priceless gem for making up and arranging talks. Slaterial can be gathered from this source for presentation In service meetings. Brethren, there is no end to the value of the Theocratic library. Use this instrument constantly and profitably in the Lord’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Posters</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The monthly posters supplied by the Society to the companies during the past two years seem to have accomplished their purpose. Therefore, commencing with January 1, 1946, they will be discontinued.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>the House of the Lord’</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">spiritual growth and nourishment. The service meetings outline and explain the proper course of conduct in field service, and, at the close thereof, the Theocratic ministry course supplies essential training as ministers of the Most High. The book studies and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies and public meetings also are an abundant provision of the generous Provider for nourishment and strength to his people to continue on in faithful service. The regular attendant at all these meetings becomes strong in the Lord, fully equipped with spiritual armor, weapons, and knowledge to join with all his brethren in unified, efficient, and diligent worship and service of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These benefits are largely lost by failure to thus associate in study and service. The company as a whole suffers and operates far below its possible effectiveness, and as individuals, and those forsaking the assembling of themselves together stand in danger of spiritual malnutrition, wasting away, and death. Those who now love the Lord will avoid such an unhappy possibility, and join themselves together in joyful worship and service to his praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Support the Company Book Study</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the great work of ‘discipling all nations’ every feature of the work is important. ‘Because the foot is not the hand, is it therefore not of the body?' the apostle asked. And so today, ‘because the company book study is not the service meeting, is it therefore not a part of the “discipling” work?’ Every feature of the work is important and must be properly taken care of if we are to carry out our commission in a manner<sup></sup>pleasing to Jehovah and thus maintain our integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In many companies the organized book studies are very weak. Conductors fail to see their obligation and privilege to properly prepare, and then fail to so conduct the book study as to make the meeting interesting and truly helpful; company publishers fail to support it by attendance, by comments, and by bringing their new interest. Some even excuse their failure to attend by stating that they would if they could count time; which reminds one of the priests and Levites who would not open and close the doors of the temple for nought.—Mal. 1: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, if one has a back-call book study on the night of the company book study, and it is the best evening for that study, one's back-call study should be given preference. But even here, if possible, it would be better to bring your goodwill interest to the company book study than to study with them alone, as by making this effort they are already making progress toward associating themselves with the Lord's organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A number of companies are inquiring as to what to study next, since they are completing their study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘'The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;.</span><span class="font4"> This would depend upon the circumstances : how new the interest is, what book was previously studied, etc. Without doubt, much benefit would be gained by going through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font4"> again. Or a study may be started in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Yew World,</span><span class="font4"> either of which would be very profitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let all get behind the company book studies and support them by proper preparation, regular attendance, ready comments, and by bring' ing new interest </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to them.</span><span class="font4"> Remember, “He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much” applies also to the company book studies.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Plan Evening House-to-House Witnessing Groups</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The mighty postwar United Nations monstrosity is rearing its ugly head over the earth issuing forth a loud, arrogant bid for universal rule in defiance of Jehovah’s righteous kingdom. This defiant challenge is heard by all people on the earth, and they are now forced to take sides with either the Devil’s old world headed for sure destruction at Armageddon or the side of the righteous kingdom of Jehovah God. These bragging claims do not go unanswered by the great God of the universe, but Jehovah sends forth to all these people the opportunity of learning of and living under his righteous kingdom forever. This he does by sending forth his witnesses who confess his name to all nations so that those of goodwill may be made glad and rejoice with the Lord's favored ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The light of God's Word shines forth in these troublous days like a beacon light at midnight lighting the way for all those in this world of blackness and distress to come unto the great Source of light and understanding, Jehovah God. Jehovah lias been using the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">magazine to spread forth the light of truth for 67 years. The number of people reached by this magazine is rapidly growing, and by the time Armageddon strikes the nations will know that Jehovah is God and the rightful ruler of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Results of Campaign Thus Far</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During January of this current </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign a total of 39,768 new subscriptions were put through the Brooklyn oilice, to compare with 20,656 entered last year during the same period of time. Up to the date this went to press we had entered 74,000 new subscriptions, and there are many more in the mail. This shows real effort to ‘make glad the nations’ with Jehovah’s joyful message. I&gt;‘t us continue the good work-. Remember, 150,000 new subscriptions by April 30 for the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Plan Evening Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The days are now getting longer and it is possible to engage in the house-to-house work much later in the evening than during the winter months. Now that most of the winter weather has passed, this is the time to make plans for increasing our activity in the field service. Servants should make arrangements for additional evening group witness service during the weekdays so that more territory can be covered with the Kingdom message and the people of good-will invited to attend the public meetings and other headquarters studies where they may gain the necessary knowledge and appreciation that will lead them to life in the New World. Publishers will gladly support such group service arrangements and increase their hours in the field service. Thus they will be confessing unto others what they themselves believe in their hearts. “For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” (Rom. 10:10) It is necessary to have the right heart attitude and faith in the Lord’s promises, and then with the mouth speak forth what is in the heart. This preaching or confession is required by Jehovah’s righteous law in order to bring salvation to the one who confesses these Kingdom truths to other men of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our Leader and Commander, Christ Jesus, set us the example of how this confessing is to be done by devoting his time to preaching directly to the people of good-will in their homes. He instructed the disciples how to properly and tactfully engage in the house-to-house witnessing, and impressed upon them the fact that this was necessary to insure their own salvation as well as publicize the Kingdom gospel. Today, the same law applies. Instead of being content with just spending our time passing out handbills or engaging in the magazine work only, we should devote a good portion of our time to the actual house-to-house confession of our knowledge. Every Kingdom publisher should be skilled in wielding “the sword of the spirit” in door-to-door conversations with the people. By spending more time in the service we shall place more literature and obtain more subscriptions, as well as enable ourselves to make more back-calls and start more studies. This, in turn, will reflect favorably in our reports for the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Call Back on the Good-Will</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After we place literature or obtain subscriptions we should never forget to call back on these persons. Our confession to each person has not been completed until we exhaust every means possible to aid these of good-will to gain a knowledge of the truth. We should call back on these people again and again until they either follow along and take their stand for the Lord's organization or definitely make it known that they do not wish to receive these blessings. Go back within two or three weeks and leave them the next issue of the magazine if their subscription is not coming along yet. Prove to them that you are interested in their welfare, by calling back. Each time we call we should be well prepared, knowing how to present the truth and how to use all of the equipment needed for a back-call. Thorough previous preparation is essential.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Pioneer Letter</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">With the March </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant the </span><span class="font3">Society is forwarding, addressed to all company publishers, a letter outlining the privileges and the responsibility of each consecrated servant of the Lord, as they relate </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 2)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Be</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Glad, Ye Nations” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">New Booklet Released at Baltimore Assembly</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Ten Million to Be Distributed!</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">First at Cleveland, next at Copenhagen, then at London, and finally at Baltimore, eager multitudes listened with rapt attention as Brother Knorr delivered the speech “Be Glad, Ye Nations”. With masterly logic he proceeded to marshal the Scriptural testimony and physical facts disclosing the real secret for gladness and how to be among the only joyful people on earth today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why be glad now? “The transcendent reason ... to rejoice and be glad is the establishment of the kingdom of God and the operation of it for the vindication of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and his sacred name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So that men of good-will everywhere may share In this rejoicing, the gladsome invitation has been put in booklet form: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations&quot;.</span><span class="font3"> It contains 64 pages and has been given a beautiful colored cover in keeping with its heartcheering message, and is now being printed by the millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Servants Vindicated</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This booklet not only contains the most forceful and joyous presentation of the Kingdom theme yet given, but in “Jehovah’s witnesses in the Crucible” we have the finest argument ever published proving that Jehovah’s witnesses, and they alone, are the true servants of the Almighty God Jehovah. Those who were fortunate enough to hear the powerful delivery of this message by Brother Knorr last fall at Cleveland will never forget it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With telling effect it refutes the Hierarchy’s taunting charge, “They have no evidence whatever that Jehovah ever asked them to be His witnesses,” by showing the Scriptural qualifications of speaking in the name of Jehovah, turning the people to Him, and teaching them His Word as clearly applying to the witnesses of Jehovah and to none others. Strikingly contrasted is the course of the Hierarchy with that of Jehovah’s witnesses. On the one hand we have the evidence of an organization, claiming to be Christian, conspiring with the totalitarian forces of darkness in their efforts to rule the world, playing favorites with them and sharing in their victories; and on the other hand we have the record of the true witnesses of Jehovah: the letters and telegrams of October 7, 1934, so clearly stating their position, official documents, records from the public press, private letters, etc., all bearing unequivocal testimony to their immovable stand for the right worship; never for a moment compromising in spite of their receiving the worst treatment accorded to any in camps notorious for their revolting sadistic brutality and fiendishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah's witnesses came through that fiery trial with their organization as witnesses of the true and living God unconsumed, unsinged, and unsullied. They stand vindicated as being true to their Godgiven name. Vindicated, not by the actions of official bodies in lifting the restrictions placed upon them, but by the Almighty God himself. He it is that sustained them. To Him belongs the praise. “If it had not been Jehovah who was on outside, w’hen men rose up against us; then they had swallowed us up alive.”—Psalm 124:2,3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A. 8. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Organization and Diligence</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Carefully study this new booklet. It will cause you to glory in the fact that you are a servant of Jehovah and fill you with a burning zeal to tell the glad tidings to the world. And opportunity to do so you will have. Beginning w’lth April there will be a three-month campaign with this new booklet, with a goal of ten million copies before the year is up. Can we do it? We </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">can!</span><span class="font3"> How? By each company publisher’s accepting as an obligation before the Lord the minimum quota of 100 booklets, and each full-time publisher 500, and then talking and placing booklets until all of them are In the hands of the people. Do so, first of all, by engaging regularly in the house-to-house work, endeavoring to leave a booklet at each home called on during April, in connection with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign, and continuing through May and June. Further, spend one evening each week in booklet work until all of the territory has been covered. (In the larger cities many of the publishers will be able to exceed their quota, thus making up for some publishers unable to meet it because of having widely scattered territory.) Supply them to your good-will interest so that they too can have a share in this work. Remember, “Be Glad, Ye Nations” is our theme for the year. Keep singing it by placing the booklet at every opportunity. By each publisher’s putting his shoulder to the wheel our goal of ten million can be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the campaign months of April, May, and June, a special rate of two cents a copy for companies will apply. Pioneer rate will be one cent per copy. Companies and pioneers should order supplies immediately, and wherever possible combine their orders so as to save shipping charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you believe that the Kingdom is established, is actually here? Do you appreciate the importance of that truth, and are you rejoicing in it? Do you visualize your deliverance, and are you singing about it? Are you determined to carry on as a true witness until Armageddon arrives? Then you will do your utmost to place your quota of the ten million copies of the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”.</span><span class="font3"> Remember, a copy in every home in your territory !</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">” Testimony Period </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">miendoiis Service Effort</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">indifferent at times; guess I’ll have to try harder.” That is what counts, the determination to try harder, and the willingness to not slack the hand. Jehovah loves a giver of reasonable service, and will bless his efforts with wondrous results. Be-! come thoroughly familiar with the contents of each issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and you will be able to show others why they also should obtain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Reasons for Peak Effort</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another marvelous inspiration to activity comes through Jehovah’s gracious provision of the new booklet, “Be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Glad, Ye Nations&quot;.</span><span class="font3"> During this joyful Testimony Period that message of hope will be presented to the people with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">offer, and left in every home where the people will read it. The faithful , performance of reasonable service by every Kingdom publisher will result in the distribution of millions of coi&gt;ies of this message of salvation. We also rejoice in the latest </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font3"> No. 15, that can be used to further acquaint the people with the exaltation of Jehovah's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To further stimulate us to joyful activity, we now have the new public lectures with their fresh and up-to-date messages to guide men in the way of righteousness. Everyone will be glad to share in advertising these and fully co-operating in assisting the people of good-will to attend the lectures. While thus engaged, always keep the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">offer before the people and be ready at all times to obtain subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Still further, it will be the joy of Jehovah's servants, wherever ; they may be, to come together on April 1(1, after 6 p. m.. to observe the Memorial. At that time they will rejoice to contemplate the scriptures concerning the faithfulness of Jehovah’s Chief Servant, our Leader and Commander, and will gladly follow his example in presenting their bodies as living sacrifices. Meditating upon Jehovah's victories over the antitypical Egyptian enemies. they will participate in the joyful feast of liberation, and, in appreciation of these rich mercies of Jehovah, they will be anxious to perforin what is their reasonable service. Every company, therefore, should be prepared to aid all those anxious to engage in Kingdom service. All these things point to April as a peak month of publishers, effort, placements, and joy.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>“Reasonable Service</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>April to Overflow in Tr</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Peak of Publishers, Effort, Placements, Joy!</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">During April, the greatest of all </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaigns to date will be brought to a climactic conclusion by a tremendous effort that it is expected will swell to a peak in every feature of Kingdom service. In order to stimulate every servant of God to vigorous action, the moving words of the apostle Paul at Romans 12:1 are set forth as our guiding text for this special testimony period. Setting a marvelous example himself, he beseeches or earnestly calls upon all his brethren, by God's mercies, to present their bodies a living sacrifice in constant, willing Kingdom service, which he explains is but '‘your reasonable service”, or that which Jehovah rightfully requires of each consecrated servant. As these faithful ones present themselves by the thousands during the “Reasonable Service” Testimony Period, the spirit of God will motivate them to the accomplishment of wondrous exploits in the presentation of his message of truth through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Thrilling Prospects</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A review of Jehovah’s gracious provisions in behalf of his people, and the opportunities of service that open up as a result, must of necessity stir each servant of God into zealous activity. First, the present </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign, because of Jehovah's rich blessings upon it, has swollen into such a crescendo of effort and results that no one wishing to perform his reasonable service can possibly avoid an enthusiastic participation in it. This means that all irregular publishers, some that may have previously been inactive, and many of the newly interested, will gladly avail themselves of this opportunity to go forward in unity of action so that it will mark a peak in the number of publishers for the month. It also means that preparation will be made by every company to render the necessary assistance to everybody associated with it to do his reasonable service during April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions are pouring into the office by the thousands. People are anxious to learn why the empty promises of men are not coming to pass, and they turn eagerly to God's Word for enlightenment. They have not brought their subscriptions here, but faithful servants of God in carrying out their reasonable service have gone to their homes and pointed them to the way of truth. This proves that by faithfully calling upon the people and telling them about </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> you too can obtain subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Diligent Effort Required</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many persons when being called upon may manifest indifference or even opposition to the message of truth; but do not be turned aside by such obstacles. Learn to overcome objections and change indifference to interest by using the knowledge of tactful presentation, and other publishing helps that you have gained through attending the Theocratic ministry school. Keep on until you find those who are hungering and thirsting for the truth. Radiate zeal and sincerity. Manifest the confidence of one who puts his trust in the Most High God, and by continued efforts you will obtain results. One active pioneer publisher wrote, toward the end of January, “I've only obtained 30 subscriptions so far; the people seem</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>March Starts Increase!</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>New Up-to-Date Talks Will Add Impetus to Campaign</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Every one of the eight public talks, as evidenced by its title, is timely and thought-provoking, designed to stir the heart and mind of good-will listeners to dig into God's Word for further information, and join in the true worship. Consider: &quot;‘Swords into Plowshares' When?” Stoppage of World War II hasn't effected it. The United Nations admittedly will not attempt it. Only with the annihilation of sword-makers in Armageddon will the way lie cleared for fulfillment of tlie promise. This is what lovers of righteousness must know, now. With many fearing destruction of this globe by fire or some atomic-age cataclysm, “Destiny of This Earth” will relieve their minds, and make them glad. “Hope for the Dead Millions&quot; shatters religion’s hell-fire theory and gives the living, concrete evidence that life in a better world is in store for their dead loved ones. Religion's history as a peace-wrecker proves her uselessness as a peacemaking organization in &quot;Religion as a Peacemaker”, while &quot;World Government at Hand” contrasts man’s monstrous, short-lived global structure with the permanent, lifegiving Theocratic World Government which Is here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With such thrilling, up-to-the-minute topics available for presentation. March and the succeeding months of 1946 should witness a marked increase in publie meeting activity. At the very outset of this campaign with new subjects, all appreciative Kingdom proclaimers, company servants and publishers, general pioneers and special pioneers, young and old, male and female, should put their hands to the plow and share unfailingly in expanding the public witness. Cooperate with tlie servants and with one another. Go into the territory selected for coverage. Stand on the streets and work the stores with magazines and handbills every Saturday. Call from house to house on Sunday (also Saturday and during the week) with full witness-equipment. Present the current campaign offer and tell the people about the enlightening public talk arranged, which they can hear free, leaving a handbill wherever you can. Look for the Lord's sheep; you'll find them. And when you do, assist them in every way possible to get to the meeting. Move unitedly into action in your territory, advertise to the limit each public speech, and Jehovah's all-powerful spirit will bring the desired results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Outlines, Instruction Sheets, New Handbills</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Three sets of outlines for the talks have been sent to each company. One set should be retained in the company file and the others separated and distributed by the company servant among those selected as speakers. Two brethren should be assigned to prepare the same talk. Each servant in a company is to receive and study carefully the revised Public Meeting Campaign instruction sheet, eight of which have been forwarded with the outlines. As soon as possible, in every company all servants should meet and consider thoroughly the material therein. Speakers should be selected, and plans made for systematic coverage of territory. At the first service meeting following receipt of these forms, this instruction sheet should be read; it can be studied in detail at later service meetings. One copy should be posted</span></p>

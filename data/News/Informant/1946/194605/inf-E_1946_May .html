<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Bound Book Offer Booklet Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Month in Which to Show Forth His Praise!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The all-important issue of Jehovah’s supremacy presses ever closer for final settlement. World leaders insist not only that they can remedy the steadily increasing sorrows of mankind, but that they can build a world of wondrous opportunities, with security, freedom and plenty for all. Standing squarely in opposition to those vain imaginations, Jehovah’s chosen people lift high their voices in the bold proclamation that He alone is God, and that his righteous government is the only hope for men. Thus the issue is squarely joined. The people for the issue cannot be silent or inactive. During May they will rejoice to show forth Jehovah’s praise, because they have been formed for that very purpose. Our text for May’s service activities sets forth these precious facts, as recorded at Isaiah 43: 21: “This people have I formed for myself: they shall shew forth my praise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Abundance of Offers During May</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What a busy month May is going to be! There will not be an idle moment as the three main lines of activity are engaged in. First comes the main offer of the month, 3 bound books and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”,</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of 50c. All the bound books from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font3"> to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion </span><span class="font3">will be used in this presentation. Beginning with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance, Creation,</span><span class="font3"> etc., pioneers and companies will make up combinations according to the books available. Pioneers, especially, should make up combinations of six, on a dollar contribution, and see that all interested persons are given the opportunity to obtain these bound books while the special offer lasts. This provides an excellent opportunity for all brethren and goodwill interest to complete their personal sets with any books that are now missing. All the people whose names are on the back-call files, and those subscribing for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer,</span><span class="font3"> are excellent prospects for visiting with these various book combinations. Call their attention to the various references to the bound books made in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and what a great assistance the books will be to them in their search for truth. This will be a great opportunity to clear the shelves of books that will do far greater good in the hands of the i)eople of good-will. Companies and pioneers will, of course, co-operate with each other in placing whatever stock of these books is on hand. Orders will be filled from the Brooklyn office and the depots according to the supply available. At Brooklyn we are out of stock of all books from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font3"> to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches;</span><span class="font3"> therefore</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">do not include these in orders sent to the Brooklyn office. Our largest stock is the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation;</span><span class="font3"> hence these should be stressed when ordering from the Brooklyn office. By unified and diligent action during May and June, all the present supply of these books can be left in the homes of the people for their comfort and enlightenment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Issue Emphasized</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every one of these volumes, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Deliverance, Creation, Reconciliation, Government, Life, Prophecy, Light</span><span class="font3"> (1 and 2), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> (1, 2, and 3), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation, Preparation, dehor ah, Riches, Enemies, Salvation,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font3"> stands four-square for the issue of Jehovah’s supremacy. They are all dedicated to the exaltation of his holy name. They show forth His praise alone. They will enable all who read them to clearly understand the issue of universal domination, guiding all lovers of righteousness to take their stand on God’s side and live. For all these reasons, the people for the issue will rejoice to take these books to the people during May and June, and by specially concentrating on the back-call names not only will back-call activity be increased, but the foundation will be laid for many book studies. Follow up all interest found, so that many others may come to know of and serve the Lord and show forth his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society will credit the companies, where desired, with 15c for each combination placed; so, if the credit is wanted, show on the bottom of the company monthly report card the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">number of combinations </span><span class="font3">of 3 books placed by the company publishers, and the literature account will be credited accordingly. (Company publishers may obtain these books on contribution of 15c each during the campaign.) Pioneers obtaining books from a company will contribute the regular pioneer rates to the company, and a statement showing the complete transaction, signed by both parties involved, should be sent to the Society, so that the company account can be adjusted. All exchange of literature between companies can be settled locally, each company co-operating in using up all the stock of the older books on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Booklet Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While diligently presenting the offer of 3 bound books, we have the joy of also offering the new booklet, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”. It</span><span class="font3"> will be left with the three-book combination, of course, but where the combination of 3 bound books cannot be placed one bound book and the booklet will be offered, on a 25c contribution. Additionally, however, this booklet, with its message of joy and hope, will be left everywhere possible. It is an honor to Jehovah</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the Issue</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Await May’s Service</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">to note that the companies and pioneers are ordering supplies of this booklet as fast as it can be printed and shipped, even though many millions have already been shipped out. This is not to be wondered at; for when have we ever had a clearer presentation of the greatest of all issues? When have the physical facts combined with the Scriptures to more vividly set forth Jehovah’s witnesses as His people for the issue, or borne greater testimony to Jehovah’s saving power? No wonder the Lord’s people are anxious to get it into the hands of the people. Call on all the leading citizens with it, see that the judges, police chiefs, school officials, and various government bodies in your community are supplied with a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”,</span><span class="font3"> so that they may have the opportunity to learn of the right course to take in the impending world crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then we have the opportunity to engage in evening witnessing. This is particularly good for study groups, and every company bookstudy conductor may arrange to take his study group into the field at least one evening a week for booklet distribution. Invite all the newly interested ones to go along also, because this is a very easy form of field service, just right for getting new ones started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Subscription Period Extended</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The third line of activity will be the extension of the special subscription offer of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer </span><span class="font3">Campaign to the 15th of May, so that all on our back-call lists may have full opportunity to avail themselves of the subscription offer, and also others who may not have been able to contribute during the campaign but desired to do so at a later date. You will all rejoice to know that the office is still receiving vast numbers of subscriptions. The total number now entered is 195,000, for which we give thanks to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Right in line with the terms of their commission, the people for the issue will show forth His praises by standing in all prominent places with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> Street-corner and store-to-store magazine activity will be in full swing during May; and here again the Lord’s blessing is so manifest upon the efforts of His servants that it has required an extra night crew in the mailing department at the Society’s factory to handle the great demand for the magazines. Does not all this evidence of Jehovah’s favor upon the activity of his chosen ones cause you to rejoice and press on with increased zeal to greater exploits by His grace?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Still further, in this busy month the public meeting activity will be zealously engaged in. By now the speakers have the new talks prepared, and it will be a great joy to invite the people throughout the territory to come and hear the new series. How aptly, therefore, the text for the month describes Jehovah’s chosen in action! They have been formed for “myself”, says the mighty Lord of Hosts. They are the people for the issue; “they shall shew forth my praise.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>The Pioneer Call</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Each One to Consider</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Are you serving Jehovah with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font3">perfect heart? That is the question that each consecrated servant must answer today. True, there is a great deal of comfort in the realization that God requires perfection of heart devotion rather than perfection of the flesh, never making a mistake. And it is gratifying to know that every one of His servants can be pleasing to Him and receive His rewards, regardless of one’s circumstances and conditions, regardless of how much or how little one may be able to do in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But there is also a serious and sobering thought connected with that. To have His approval we cannot hold back </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anything.</span><span class="font3"> We cannot make excuses by comparing ourselves with others (an unwise thing to do; see 2 Corinthians 10:12), but must realize that regardless of what any other creature may or may not do, we must be perfect in faith and wholly given over to serving Jehovah God. Thousands, fully appreciating this fact, have entered the pioneer service, and are thus walking perfectly before their Creator. Does walking with a perfect heart before Jehovah mean the full-time service for you? Only you yourself can answer that question. However, we are confident that there are many, even thousands, who, upon carefully considering that question, will come to the conclusion that they too can, yes, must serve Jehovah full-time so as to walk perfectly before Him. It was to assist these very ones to see their privileges that three letters regarding the pioneer service were sent to all companies in recent months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Vacation Pioneer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then there is the vacation pioneer privilege. You school teachers, school children, and others who will be having several months’ vacation soon, what are you doing about your opportunity to serve Jehovah perfectly during the summer vacation? Are you preparing to enjoy the blessings of full-time service, of daily bringing honor to Jehovah’s name, and of daily inviting the people of good-will to be glad with His people? Will you keep busy this summer “redeeming the time” as a pioneer publisher?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the many blessings that will be yours as full-time publishers, you youthful publishers will be laying a good foundation for full-time service when you grow up. Then, becoming a year-round pioneer will not seem to be a hard thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let each consecrated servant of Jehovah God who is not already a full-time worker carefully examine himself to determine if he is perfect in faith and wholly given over to the service of Jehovah God. If such examination reveals that the full-time service is also for him, then let him send for a pioneer application today. (Summer pioneers should specify that a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">vacation</span><span class="font3"> pioneer blank is wanted.)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Defense Through Knowledge” Testimony Period </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Right Knowledge Shelters God’s People</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>June Features Intense Educational Work</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">This world possesses much knowledge. Yet, with centuries of learning behind them, can men of this world point to one instance in whicli knowledge has served them as a real defense? They cannot. Even within this generation, with its magnificent schools and brilliant educators, worldly wisdom has not shielded mankind from the ravaging effects of two world wars, with its horrible aftermath of famine, disease, pestilence, and death of millions. Nor will it furnish protection against the coming world disaster, Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nevertheless, knowledge </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font3"> a defense. Not ‘knowledge falsely so called’, but true knowledge, gained through careful study of God’s Word, knowledge that Jehovah is reigning and the Kingdom established, knowledge that Satan’s day is over, with Armageddon and eternal blessings on the way. Can Jehovah’s people prove that such knowledge has served them as a defense? The proof is abundant. Through the crucible of flaming-hot persecution they have passed with integrity unconsumed. In the face of mounting hardships, they have continued to press forward zealously in Kingdompreaching work. Further, while hundreds of millions sink deep into the mire of despair, losing all hope, Jehovah’s people live free of fear and anxiety, a joyful and contented people, glad to be alive in this day. And all this because of right knowledge, the foundation for their unshakable faith, by reason of which the Lord has been pleased to cast up for them a strong defense against the enemy’s attacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Defense against demonic assaults in this critical postwar era is assured, but only to those who continue to absorb protective knowledge. A portion of one’s time each day, therefore, should be devoted to study of the Bible and the Society's publications: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> bound books, booklets, and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Casting Up a Strong Defense In June</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fittingly, the testimony period for June is termed “Defense Through Knowledge”. “For wisdom is a defence, money is a defence, and the advantage of the knowledge of wisdom is, she reviveth her possessors.” (Eccl. 7:12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Younff)</span><span class="font3"> During June Kingdom publishers will not merely take in right knowledge through study, but will unselfishly give it out to others, aiding them to find defense against the destruction ahead. This is the wise course that merits divine approval. In June the offer of any three bound books from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of Goel</span><span class="font3"> to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Reliffion</span><span class="font3"> will continue. What a splendid way to impart true knowledge! Three 384-page bound books on a contribution of only 50c. Surely no company in America should have difficulty in clearing off its shelves by the 30th of June every one of these older books, getting them into the hands of the public, where they belong. Servants and all publishers will work enthusiastically to this end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Simultaneously the special campaign with “Be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Glad,</span><span class="font3"> Ye </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Nations” </span><span class="font3">will enter its third month. The final days of June should climax the greatest single-booklet campaign to date. During June every effort possible should be made, every avenue of distribution should be employed, toward the goal of getting at least. 10.000,000 copies of “Be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Glad, Ye Nations”</span><span class="font3"> distributed before</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">the end of the year. With longer days, evening booklet service can be instituted in all companies. Evenings now open may be utilized, in addition to an hour or so preceding company book studies or individual back-calls and book studies, in territory adjacent thereto. In this work only a minute or two need be spent at each door, giving a brief witness and placing a booklet. If interest is located, arrange for a return visit.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Uptrend In Public Meetings Anticipated</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publishers nation-wide appear to be lending greater support to public meetings. This is as it should be, and June, the fourth month of public meetings with the new talks, ought to be marked by an even more intensive effort to engage in all features of this educational work. In addition to indoor halls, parks, pavilions, or any other suitable outdoor arrangement, can be used during summer months. Companies may wish to inaugurate, where practical, a series of weekdayevening meetings; this has proved quite satisfactory in some places. Reports indicate that the new handbills, giving a brief but powerful witness through the advertising on the back, are serving an excellent purpose. Distribute them widely; it is believed that they will do much toward stirring reasonable minds to earnestly seek ‘defense through knowledge’. Hundred-percent publisher support of each public meeting in June, that might well be the aim of all companies. Lend a helping hand to the irregular; encourage newly interested to join in; do everything possible to make June a banner public-meeting month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While covering public meeting territory with literature and handbills the publisher should have as his objective starting at least one study in the area by the end of the series. This will necessitate keeping an accurate record of not-at-homes, calling back until we find someone, and making return visits on every literature obtainer. Foreign-speak-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Knowledge is indeed a defense, but not to one who merely stores it in his mind. Knowledge must be used daily in Kingdom service to be of permanent benefit to the creature. So cast up a sturdy defense during this testimony period by Theocratic study and work.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Cleveland, Ohio</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>August 4-11, 1946</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">“Plan now and make arrangements to attend.” Such are the words of Brother Knorr in his letter of February 20, 1946, announcing the coming convention at Cleveland, Ohio. Truly, now is the appointed time to ready ourselves that we may be on hand and a part of this great gathering of all nations to worship Jehovah in convention assembled. Remembering the wise man’s counsel, “A man may plan his course; but the Lord directs his steps” (Prov. 16:9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Amer. Trans.), </span><span class="font3">let us begin now planning our course and praying Jehovah’s direction on our steps. The objective is to be on hand, not just self, but family and people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since our last great international convention, at St. Louis, August, 1941, much has happened in the I earth. Brethren have been intensely persecuted and many incarcerated during this period. These the Lord has been pleased to deliver and bring forth with a mighty hand. Many of these brethren will be on hand at Cleveland as evidence of Jehovah's protection and blessing in the midst of a crucible of fiery affliction. Certainly, if brethren from many nations afar off will make the effort and come, those living within the territorial boundaries of the United States should not in any wise fail to be there. The majority in this country will not have too much difficulty in getting there, for it is estimated that over one-half of the entire population of the United States live within a radius of only 500 miles of Cleveland!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is only about three months uu-i til the convention. Many will have | already arranged their vacations from secular activity so as to in-j elude the eight days of August i 4-11. Those who have not done so should do it now. Let not the ‘occupations of this life embarrass you’. Secular taskmasters have no authority to require you to refrain from worshiping the Lord. The ‘ command is to ‘forsake not the assembling of yourselves together’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">, School children will also be free to go to this convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I Every reasonable effort should be made to aid all who profess J to be on the Lord’s side to attend this assembly. No one should go to the assembly with cars partially full, while others have to i stay at home for lack of accom! modations. If we believe that this ! is a feast provided by the Lord for his people at this time, not only will we want to be there ourselves, but we will assist our brethren to be there to the extent of our ability. The good-will interest should not be overlooked in these</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">your arrangements to attend, looking to the Lord to open up the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Knorr states in his letter, “The best way to plan is to invite the people of good-will to be there with you, and prepare them for future service and blessings.” Begin now talking convention at every back-call and book study. If you have any old convention reports, take one to your back-calls and discuss the manner in which Jehovah’s people assemble, etc., and urge them to plan on attending, aiding them all you can toward doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the larger companies the company servant can begin now investigating transportation possibilities, extra coaches on trains, chartered bus service, etc., and talk these things over with the servants and with the brethren assembled. Find out what are the plans of the majority, and summarize your transportation problem; and write the Society regarding it by May 25. It may be that special trains from other sections can be so routed as to conveniently pick up your group, or that your arrangements can be directed to the aid of others en route. (Mark the envelopes of such correspondence “Convention Transportation”.) Take into consideration the people of good-will in all of these arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Cleveland is in an ideal setting for this postwar assembly of all nations. The stadium where the convention will be held is sheltered. has normal provisions for 8.3,900 people, and overflow space inside for 17.000 more on the playing field. In addition, thousands of others can be accommodated in adjacent sections. The cool Lake Erie breezes blow right into Cleveland, and particularly on the stadium which we will use: it is situated right on the lakeside. All brethren will be adequately provided for in one spot, and this will work to good advantage, both in edifying assemblies and in reunion of fellowship after five years of multicityassemblies. due to wartime restrictions and limitations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Considerable work will, of course, be required to ready the place for the convention. However, the Society requests that only those brethren who receive official notice to proceed to Cleveland ahead of time do so. Others will remain in their respective assignments until the time of the convention, caring for the good-will interest and preparing for the local brethren's attending at Cleveland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now that multitudes are hearing the message of gladness throughout the entire earth and the great educational campaign is steadily moving forward, are you glad? Are you going to be glad with all nations in convention assembled at Cleveland, August 4-11?</span></p>

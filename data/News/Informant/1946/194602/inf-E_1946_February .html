<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Jehovah’s Servants Follow Victorious Leader</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Moved by God’s holy spirit, Isaiah foretold the raising up of a glorious Leader and Commander to be used by the Holy One of Israel as the Vindicator of his righteous cause, and to bring salvation to all who would follow his commands. Isaiah depicts Jehovah as saying: “Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.”—Isa. 55 : 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is our guiding text for February, the “Commanpbb’s&quot; Testimony Period. It explains why, instead of being suppressed and diminished under enemy pressure, the Kingdom gospel increases and flourishes. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> monthly issue has steadily increased and now is coming forth again in many languages once seemingly silenced by demon action. Our glorious Commander revives and raises up his faithful followers to unite their efforts in a tremendous world-wide </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">Campaign. What joy it brings to visualize this world-wide army of zealous witnesses following their Leader and Commander to victory! He will not rest nor be turned aside until righteousness flourishes in all the earth. We can share in this triumphal march during February by earnestly offering </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">in many places and to everybody, in this &quot;Commandkr's” Testimony Period. With more than 65,000 publishers in the United States of America girded for enthusiastic action, the quota of 150,000 subscriptions seems singularly small, and we are determined to obtain as many more as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Individual's Responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is no doubt that from the world-wide viewpoint this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign will surpass anything previously accomplished, but that which concerns every individual is his own personal share therein. Each publisher asks, ‘How am I going to obtain 4 subscriptions?' The answer is, time and effort. The new testimony card presents the offer in such an appealing manner that judicious and regular use of it in the field is bound to bring results. It becomes, therefore, a matter of diligently and faithfully using the provisions of the Lord in attaining the quota or goal set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of course, in using the testimony card, it will also be necessary to answer questions raised by interested people, to give an earnest description of the contents of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> Didn't your heart rejoice as you learned of “The King’s Purge Against Religion”, of the “Feast of Liberation&quot;, of “Baptism”, of the</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Kingdom Sabbath”, of &quot;Remember</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font2">will bring them peace and joy and lead them in the way of life? Then surely by zealous effort in all features of Kingdom service (luring the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign everyone can faithfully strive to attain the quota each month. In so doing, the company publishers alone would obtain more than 250,000 subscriptions in this country, without including the pioneers. each of whom will endeavor to obtain seven a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Co-ordination of Effort and Opportunity</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to diligent door-to-door activity, the back-call and bookstudy branch of service surely presents wonderful opportunities for introducing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> offer. Many back-calls will now be made on people who subscribed last year but have allowed the subscription to expire without renewing it. This is often done because of negligence, and it becomes the privilege of the publisher to correct the situation by rekindling the spark of interest and developing it to the point where the person of good-will not only renews the subscription, but acts in accordance with the truths he learns. Where back-call book studies have been held for some time, do your best to enable those attending to accompany you in field service during the “Commander’s” Testimony Period. Likewise, let the spirit of cooperation extend to everyone in the company. Not only get into energetic action yourself, but see to it that all who need assistance are given the necessary aid to share in this allimportant effort. Take </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> on the streets, and let everyone in town know of their opportunity to subscribe for it. In other words, present the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> offer to everyone, and on every occasion possible during these four months of special activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Efliciency in preparation is essential ; so go to the field fully equipped. Take sample copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> subscription blanks, and a list of the different languages in which it is now obtainable. In English. Spanish, Italian, Greek, Polish, Rus! sian, Slovak, and Ukrainian it can be had for $1.00 a year, and in Danish. French, German, Hollandish, Norwegian, and Swedish it is $1.50 for a year's subscription. Of course, the premium is given in every case, and when turning in the subscription the publisher may deduct 25c to cover the cost of the book and booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It will take from one to two months after subscribing before the person receives the magazine by mail. This presents an excellent op-I portunity to show your interest in the subscriber, by calling back and him with each current</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">interest </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font2"> the point where the full value of the life-sustaining message of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font2"> will be appreciated and acted upon. Let every publisher make full use of this opportunity to feed the “other sheep”, and it will pave the way for thousands of additional book studies as well as marking a tremendous increase in back-call activity. Be very careful also to adhere to the printed | instructions of the Society for handling subscriptions, and thus insure faster results in getting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Put on vigorous public meetings, thoroughly advertised, going into many places not previously covered. Keep </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> continually before the people while inviting them to the meetings. Under the leadership of our mighty Commander, let every servant of God go forth fired with zeal at the prospect of feeding his “other sheep”, in a faithful world-wide effort that will gladden the heart of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">meeting campaign for the coming year. The new series of talks begins with all series commencing after March 1. All series starting in February, and which continue over into March or April, should be completed with the old subjects that have been advertised, but all new series, beginning after March 1, should have the new subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The outlines being sent each company are for the use of the speakers and for the company file; two sets for the use of the speakers and one for the file. It is suggested that more than one speaker prepare each talk, so that each time the talk is given the same brother will not be required to deliter it. This will tend toward greater variety and the maintenance of public interest. The eight instruction sheets are for the use of each servant in the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The company servant should call the servants together and arrange for a very thorough consideration of these new instructions and outlines, and make all necessary preparations for covering their territory very systematically and thoroughly with this new series of talks. They should select the speakers and assign the talks immediately. Only mature, capable brethren should be used as speakers. It may be that some who have been previously used as speak-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">ers may not be as capable as some newer and younger brethren. In that event, the lietier-qualified brothers should lie used. The selection of speakers, and all other arrangements pertaining to the public meeting campaign, should be done with an eye single to the Lord's glory. Selection should be made impartially and without discrimination.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">A study of these outlines will quickly demonstrate how up-to-date and pointed these talks are for use at this present time. All speakers should approach the preparation of these talks prayerfully, looking to the Lord to quicken their minds to thoroughly and carefully prepare their talks along the lines directed by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The main objective in putting on</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">Av. I a series of public meet ings is to <sup>B-c</sup> ; thoroughly cover the territory from <sup>607</sup> \ house to house and follow up with back-calls and book studies. When a company selects a territory in which the public meeting series will be given (either 4 or 8 talks) it should be kept in mind that the door-to-door witnessing is all-important and the public meeting series is an added feature to this work wherein the publishers can invite the interested persons to one central point for an hour’s discussion on one of the vital subjects announced. Having this in mind, then, after a series of four or eight talks lias been given it is good for the publishers to return to that same territory at least a week or two to take care of the back-calls and book studies already started before going into another section of the territory and carrying on a similar arrangement.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Salvation Thro</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">New Subjects to Spur Public Meeting Campaign </span><span class="font2">The ways of this world are ruthless and hard. It bestows its favors on those displaying the greatest degree of mental sharpness and physical prowess regardless of need. In striking contrast thereto, Jehovah, in his love and mercy, requires neither unusual mental nor physical strength of those who would receive salvation unto life eternal. In fact, that which Jehovah requires is so simple that the test falls just where he wants it to: solely on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">willinff-ness</span><span class="font2"> of his servants. It is something that we have learned to do since early infancy, something that we cannot help doing. And what is that? Simply to talk. Yes, talk, talk, talk. So simple, so easy to do, and therefore so perfect a test of our willingness and our appreciation of his blessings. As our slogan for the month of March puts it, “Salvation Through Confession” (Rom. 10:10) is what Jehovah has decreed for human creatures that would live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How just, how reasonable, this requirement to make confession, to preach, to witness, to talk I In order to receive salvation ourselves we must extend to others the opportunity to avail themselves of it. So obviously right and fair, is it not? Also, if we would receive life by having Jesus confess us before our heavenly Father, we must confess him before men. Why should he acknowledge us before the Almighty God. the King of Eternity, if we are ashamed to confess him before weak, imperfect human creatures?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How can we most effectively make a confession before men that will result in salvation to those that hear it as well as to ourselves during the month of March? By engaging in all forms of gospel preaching. First of all, by talking 1l’«tc7itoicer subscriptions at every opportunity, at every door. Remember, it is no great thing to receive a contribution of one dollar for a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> with a premium of a bound book and a booklet. Such a wealth of spiritual food simply cannot be measured in terms of dollars and cents. There just Is no comparison between the cost of preparation and distribution of this literature and the hope of eternal life it holds out. Therefore, let no servant of the Lord be hesitant about presenting this offer to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Have Hearts Filled with Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To make a proper confession before men, no mere routine witness or mechanical lip-service such as religionists use will do. We must ‘believe with our hearts’, that is, have our minds filled with the truth and its goodness, so that our lips may overflow with words of knowledge and wisdom spoken with earnestness and confidence. Therefore, as we study our </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers,</span><span class="font2"> we should make note of gems that we feel will strike a responsive chord in the hearts of those of good-will, and then remember to use them as opportunity affords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, to be able to make use of such we may not be hasty in our presentation. With a calm, sincere, and pleasant manner we must pave the way for the “body” of our presentation ; for to present such a matter as the campaign offer will require a little time. Having the outline of our witness clearly In mind, we shall be able </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font2"> proceed with assurance, ever ready to adjust it to meet the circumstances. And in our eagerness to impress upon them the importance of the message and their need, let us not overlook the need of Theocratic tactfulness in answering their objections. By March all company</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ugh Confession</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">publishers should have obtained two subscriptions: all pioneers, fourteen. Have you met your quota?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Making confession also includes supporting the public meeting campaign. For more than a year, now, we have been carrying on this feature of the work with a series of eight subjects. Beginning with this month there are made available eight new, striking, and most timely subjects that will give our public meeting campaign a tremendous impetus. । Let all show their appreciation of this new provision by supporting the meetings with enthusiasm and increased activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All such activity, however, is merely a means to an end. By such we establish a Theocratic foothold, as it were. We must go farther; we must extend the foothold by calling back. Often at a single back-call we can make more confession than in a whole day of house-to-house activity. Remember, too (to use another illustration), watering is needed, the ground must be cultivated, thorns and thistles (the cares of this world) and the stones of religious objections must be removed if the seed is to have a chance. And in calling back let us do so with a purpose, a goal in mind; that of starting a book study. Appreciation that ‘salvation depends upon confession’ will help each servant of the Lord to diligently push forward in all features of the Kingdom work.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Calls Outside of Assigned Territory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Now that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign is going on in full swing, it is possible that many brethren will place </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions with friends, relatives and acquaintances who live outside of their assigned territory and in territory held ' by someone else. It is proper that such brethren should call on these individuals whom they know and try to interest them in obtaining a subscription. or any other literature, for that matter. In some instances such persons' names would be in the back-call tile and should therefore be asked for by the publisher before making the first call, and all later follow-ups. Regular Back-Call Follow-up Reports should be turned in to the back-call servant after each visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">People who are met in street magazine work, and who show interest, should be presented with the opportunity of obtaining a subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> It may be necessary to call at their homes and display </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> to them. It is quite right for the publisher who met the interested one on the street and created the initial interest to do this. Our purpose is to preach ’this Kingdom gospel' by placing the literature in the hands of the people and in all cases follow up these placements by back-calls. The person holding the territory should not take issue on this point, but should, rather, be glad that the literature is placed with the people. They have no way of knowing whether they would be able to get the subscription or place the literature with the people themselves. Consequently, they should not be critical of other publishers who obtain such results in their territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This does not mean, of course, that one publisher should go into another publisher’s territory and systematically witness In that territory from house to house. But, where interest has already been aroused, where the people are known to the publisher and favorably disposed toward him, and will take literature or a sub-</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Much Territory</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Many Counties Not Worked for Several Years</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">In spite of the amount of witness work that has been done in this country, it is surprising to know that 1,419 counties in the United States, or 46 percent of all the country, were not thoroughly witnessed to during the service year 1945. This represents approximately 22,000,000 people, or about 16 percent of the population, who did not have their rightful opportunity of meeting Kingdom publishers during the entire year, because of not being included in pioneer or company assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While these counties are not the thickly settled ones, nevertheless they do have large numbers of goodwill people willing to receive the truth. Someone must take the Kingdom message to them. Some of this territory has not been worked for several years and is virgin territory for any pioneer who would like to have such an assignment. Much literature can be placed, many back-calls made, and many studies started with these good-will persons. Also, there are many towns and thickly settled rural sections that are ideal for putting on public lecture series. There are yet millions of people right here in our own country who are not being regularly visited with the Kingdom message, and to whom we are commissioned to go, to “make disciples of all nations” before the end comes. These people in isolated territories must receive the Kingdom witness before Armageddon begins. The field is very large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many brethren who enter the pioneer service, and those already pioneers, give preference to city territories which are already cared for by organized companies. Thus, some territory is worked very frequently and other territory is neglected. To offset this condition the Society urges all pioneers who can do so to apply for some of these isolated counties not being served by Kingdom publishers. Some of this territory is ideal for summer witnessing, and others are good all year round. Most of the counties that are isolated at the present time are located in the south and midwest. However, in scription from him, it is proper that those persons be called on by the publisher, who may make placements and conduct back-calls and book studies with them. As far as possible and practical the publisher holding the territory should be kept advised of any such activity in his territory. There have been reports coming in to the office of brethren being excluded from calling on such people because they do not happen to hold that particular territory assignment. This is entirely improper. Every publisher should rejoice in the fact that the people in his territory have obtained this literature, regardless of from whom it was obtained, and should co-operate fully with any back-call or study arrangement that may have been made by the publisher placing the literature. If no such back-call or study exists, then the holder of the territory should try to start one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This must not be construed to mean, however, that a publisher should keep a list of the names of everyone in the city who obtains literature from him, and run around all over everybody else’s territory with new book releases. This has reference to legitimate cases in which the publisher, because of his acquaintance or intimate association with the individual, is situated in a more advantageous position to enliven the interest and make the placement than any other publisher.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Territories Needing the Most Help</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For your information we are showing here a partial list of the counties that are available and that need the most help. First will appear the name of the state, then the number of counties in that state that have not been worked since 1941: Alabama, 17 counties; Arkansas, 19; Georgia, 54; Louisiana, 25; Kentucky, 72; Tennessee, 45; Mississippi, 40; Missouri, 45; North Carolina, 39; South Carolina, 20; Texas, 65; Virginia, 32; West Virginia, 16. In the west and midwest the following have not been worked for at least five years: Colorado, 12 counties ; Illinois, 19; Indiana, 15; Iowa, 18 ; Kansas, 14; Michigan, 12; Montana, 12; Nebraska, 32; North Dakota, 14; Oklahoma, 17; South Dakota, 20; Wisconsin, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Constantly the Society receives requests from companies that say they are unable to carry on the work effectively in their assignments and that ask for pioneers to help them. But there are not nearly enough pioneers to supply the demand. Companies should endeavor to bear their own burdens and carry on the work in their own territories and thus free the pioneers to care for this hitherto unworked territory and carry the glad news of the Kingdom to the people who are anxiously waiting for someone to call on them with the message of hope and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Imitate the Apostle Paul’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A similar condition existed in Paul’s time. The territory where he was working had been developed to the point that it was possible for the local company to care for the Kingdom interests and thus free Paul to take up foreign assignments. There was much virgin territory that was hitherto unworked, and the Lord’s spirit directed that he go to these sections, to Galatia, Macedonia, Achaia, Rome, etc. In these assignments Paul put on public lectures, made back-calls, and organized the good-will interest into companies. After organizing a company, and thoroughly instructing the brethren on how to carry on the Kingdom service in their territory, he journeyed on to another assignment to stimulate interest and organize another company. Under the direction of the holy spirit, he stated, “Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.” (1 Cor. 11:1, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font2"> Will you be an ‘imitator of Paul’ and accept an assignment in some of the isolated counties in this country ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is much interest to be found and many “sheep” to be fed before the final climax at Armageddon. These isolated counties offer a splendid opportunity for pioneers to develop this interest by putting on public lectures, conducting studies with them, and organizing them into active companies of Jehovah’s witnesses. Then, like Paul, you can move on to another isolated section and do likewise. This is sure to have Jehovah's rich blessing and bring you many joys, as well as the hope for life and happiness to these millions in isolated territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you wish further information regarding any of these counties, feel free to write us and we will do all we can to aid you to enlarge your privileges.</span></p>

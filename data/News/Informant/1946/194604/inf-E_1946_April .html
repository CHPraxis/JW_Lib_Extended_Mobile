<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Make Ours a Living Sacrifice</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The text we have for consideration during April is one of the most heartsearching in the Bible, namely, Romans 12:1. According to the Rotherham translation, this text reads, “I beseech you therefore, brethren, through the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living, holy sacrifice, unto God acceptable, your rational divine service.” The apostle Paul uses as a basis for his admonition tlie compassions or tender mercies of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of God’s mercies are too numerous to be considered here, of course, but the outstanding ones at least can be considered, and that to our profit. The Kingdom with its blessings is outstanding among the tender mercies of Jehovah and first to be considered in his unmerited favor toward his creatures. Think what the Kingdom means to you and to people of good-will everywhere. Then consider redemption and its provisions, salvation and all that it means to us; and then the expansion of Jehovah’s mercies to include the Gentiles as well as the Jews. All these are evidences of God’s compassion. Then consider his holy spirit bestowed upon his creatures for their comfort, encouragement and enlightenment. Today we have the more recent evidences of Jehovah’s benevolent care in our preservation through two world wars instigated by the Devil, his preservation during the hectic days of 1938 to 1940, his comfort and sustenance in the concentration camps of Europe, Asia, and even here in America; in all of these the consecrated servants of Jehovah have tasted of his preserving power and tender care, and have seen his majestic judgment in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Take time now to dwell on these things and what they really mean to us, and see if our intimate knowledge of the Lord has increased as a result. Is our faith stronger? Is our confidence greater? Are we more sure of the Kingdom and all its blessings as a result of these experiences? If the answer is yes. and it can hardly be otherwise, then gratitude and appreciation should induce each one to show his faith by his active works, presenting his body a living, holy sacrifice, unto God acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During April we have the opportunity to demonstrate to Jehovah and to all creation our appreciation of God’s goodness toward us, by participating in the greatest </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign of all time, going from house to house, calling upon the people and presenting to them this life-giving food that has brought us so much joy and comfort. Every consecrated person who has experienced the tender mercies of God will want to have a part in this campaign and comfort others with the comfort whereby he himself has been comforted of God. That cannot help but mean a peak of publishers. In fact, if each one takes the apostle Paul's admonition seriously, we cannot fail to have 70,000 to 75,000 publishers in the field during April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The anointed are going to partake of the Memorial after sundown on April 16. When are they going to present their bodies a living sacrifice, carrying out the reality of these emblems of which they partake? Undoubtedly those who really appreciate the tender mercies of Jehovah will do so throughout the entire month. Everyone should have some time to report for April. The Jona-dabs, the companions of the remnant, who will be privileged to attend the Memorial service, are likewise afforded opportunity to use their faculties in showing forth the praises of Jehovah. A special Memorial Report card is enclosed with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font4"> The company servant will fill it out correctly and mail it to the Society immediately following the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let everyone have a part in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign, regular publishers, irregular publishers, and persons of good-will attending back-call book studies who are beginning to taste of the goodness of Jehovah God. Let them demonstrate their appreciation now by going out and having a part in his service, and drink deeper of the richness of Jehovah’s goodness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Let All Receive New Gladsome Message</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Using the new instrument, the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”,</span><span class="font4"> each one, anointed or Jonadab, can call upon the nations to come and taste of the preserving power and the compassionate care of Jehovah upon those who put their trust in Him, and thus be really glad with His people. This booklet contains the clearest, most forceful, and still the most comforting, presentation of the Kingdom message that we have had to date. If we believe this, we are going to act upon that belief. We are going to accept our quota of booklets and place them in the hands of the people. We are going to have them in our pockets or pocketbooks ready to call upon our neighbors, in the bus, on the streetcars, on the train, in the factory, in the office, or in the shop. Anywhere we are, where we meet people, we will tell them about the tender mercies of Jehovah God and call upon them to be glad with us.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font6">“BE GLAD, YE NATIONS” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Ready?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Is your own heart filled with gladness because of the Kingdom vision?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you appreciate your privilege of sharing that gladness with others ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you appreciate your obligation to extend this invitation to the nations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Are you all set for April 1 ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Have you obtained your quota of booklets ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Have you selected your extra evening for booklet witnessing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Have you in mind an effective testimony?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Are you prepared to do your part toward the goal of ten million ? Will you call with all that is in you, “BE GLAD, YE NATIONS, WITH HIS PEOPLE”?</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Letter</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The third letter encouraging all ' company publishers who can possibly do so to enter the full-time pioneer service this year is enclosed with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> to all companies. A capable brother in the company should be assigned to read this letter at the first </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study and first service meeting after its receipt, and consider the material more closely in the second service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of the brethren should listen carefully to this discussion and give sober consideration to the seriousness of the full-time pioneer service now.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">The average company publisher should have no difficulty whatever in placing 100 or more of these booklets during the three months of April, May and June. True, w<sup>r</sup>e won’t have an idle moment, week-ends, evenings, or at any other time. We shall be occupied presenting this message of hope and comfort to the people; our appreciation of God’s compassion will overflow and become the inducing cause that will drive us into the Kingdom service. We shall have no time for “movies” or social parties or old-world interests of any sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We will continue to present our bodies a living sacrifice by supporting the public meetings on Saturdays and Sundays and by following up the interest with back-calls and studies throughout the week. Evenings when we do not have back-calls or studies can be used in booklet activity. It all depends upon our appreciation of the compassion of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What is here stated regarding the company publishers applies, of course, to the pioneers also. The quota of 500 booklets is a very small one for a full-time publisher if he really goes all-out for the new world, based upon the tender mercies of Jehovah toward him and toward all people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are happy to tell you that to date the H’a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">teh to iter</span><span class="font4"> Campaign shows the following total of subscriptions: 120,000. This evidences the Lord’s favor upon this campaign, surpassing anything that we have had in the past. If each publisher continues even with increased efforts to offer his reasonable service during the remainder of this successful campaign, then, undoubtedly, when it is completed it will exceed by far the original quota of 150,000 subscriptions for this country, and 250,000 for the entire earth. The Kingdom message is going forth like a flood, covering the entire globe. I/?t each and every one have a large part in this joyful service.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>International Convention</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">On August 4 to 11, 1946, there will be an international convention of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses at Cleveland, Ohio, probably the greatest one ever held. It is hoped that the majority of the publishers in this country will find it possible to attend the assembly and, in addition thereto, many of the brethren from outside of the continental United States. Having brethren from many nations in attendance at Cleveland will give the convention an international aspect. There will not be simultaneous conventions in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some brethren have inquired about bringing their relatives and friends from various countries to Cleveland at their own expense. To these we say that the Society will be glad to supply letters or such assistance as may be proper to obtain temporary visas for the brethren who wish to come from other nations for the purpose of attending the convention. The Society cannot, of course, guarantee the financial status of persons coming to the convention from other lands. The brethren who apply for visas in other countries must be able to state how much money they have available for the trip and give the name and address of any person who may be sponsoring them, if that information is requested. A list of the Society's offices in other countries is published on the last page of the 1946 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font4"> If the Society has a branch office in a country, then that office will provide appropriate letters supporting visa applications of con-ventioners. If you desire to have information or help with regard to persons in countries not listed there, you may write to Brooklyn.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A People (or the Issue</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Three-Bound-Book Ofer to Be Featured</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Before settling the all-important issue of “Who Is Supreme?” Jehovah hurls defiance at the entire visible organization of Satan. “Let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified.” Can any of his agents point to a single act of deliverance or to any real and lasting good that their god lias brought them in all the long course of human history? On the contrary, has not the record of mankind under Satan's domination down to this very hour been one of want and bondage, of suffering and death? and all that directly due to him? And now, as in a frantic last effort to keep his subjects in bondage, he brings forth the “abomination of desolation”, which his religious dupes have praised to the skies as man’s only hope. Do not those praises already sound hollow as we note each nation torn with turmoil and strife?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In striking contrast with all this stand the witnesses of Jehovah, the ones clearly identified as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">people for the issue.</span><span class="font4"> True to their God-given name, which they received in 1931. they are giving a mighty testimony to the supremacy of Jehovah, his majesty, aimightiness, universal sovereignty, and undefeatable purposes. Far from dodging the issue, they are right in the midst of it, and their courageous activity in publishing the proofs as contained in the Bible and as shown in the fulfillment of prophecy that Jehovah is God is resulting in the highest benefit and most lasting good to men of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning them Jehovah states: “This people have I formed for myself ; they shall shew forth my praise.” (Isa. 43:21) That is our text for the month of May. (Read also verses one through twenty of the same chapter.) How can we show forth his praise?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature Presentations</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">First of all, by diligence in the house-to-house work. The month of May will see the beginning of a twomonth campaign wherein we shall offer three bound books and the new booklet “Re </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Glad,</span><span class="font4"> 1’e </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nations”,</span><span class="font4"> on a contribution of fifty cents. Books to be used in this offer are: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Harp, Deliverance, Creation, lieconciliation. Government, Life, Prophecy, Light</span><span class="font4"> I and II, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> I, II, and III, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation, Preparation, Jehovah, Riches, Enemies, Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion.</span><span class="font4"> This campaign should get all of this literature off the shelves of the company stock rooms and into the hands of the people. At Brooklyn and the depots we have a limited supply of the books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah, Enemies, Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font4"> and these will be shipped out as long as the supply lasts, and will be billed at the regular rate. Where necessary, substitutions will be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of the special offer, these books are to be placed over the counter to the publishers at contribution of fifteen cents each. At the end of the month the number of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">combinations</span><span class="font4"> (or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sets of three</span><span class="font4"> bound books) so placed with company publishers should be noted on the bottom of the company’s field service report card, and credit of fifteen cents will be given for each combination so placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Companies and pioneers will cooperate with each other, those being overstocked supplying those having need of books. Adjustments between companies and pioneers should be made locally as far as possible. Where a pioneer obtains books from a company he will contribute to the company the regular pioneer rate, and the Society will credit the company with the difference between the company and the pioneer rate upon receiving a statement signed by both the company servant and the pioneer, listing the kind and number of bound books involved. As such adjustment will be made on the basis of the regular company rate, books placed with pioneers should not be included in total combinations placed on your monthly report card. Combinations need not be limited to three bound books; pioneers especially, if they have sufficient variety, may present combinations of six or more. If unable to place a combination of three, effort should be made to place one bound book and the booklet, on a contribution of twenty-five cents; and if unable to place that, endeavor to leave the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”.</span><span class="font4"> In addition to placing the booklet at such times, each publisher should take part in the evening booklet work, so as to make steady progress toward placing his quota of one hundred </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations” </span><span class="font4">booklets, if a company publisher, or five hundred, if a pioneer. Remember, a booklet in every home! 10,000,000 before the end of the year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So that all on our back-call lists may have full opportunity to avail themselves of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription offer, also others who may not have had the necessary contribution to take advantage of the special offer but desired to do so at a later date, the campaign offer is being extended to May 15. All subscriptions obtained up to May 15 should be sent to the Society immediately after that date, so that the total report for the campaign can be closed out May 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Further Opportunities to Testify</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only by bringing the truth to the people in printed form shall we be testifying to Jehovah’s supremacy during the month of May, but also by means of the public meeting campaign. By now each company organization should be so geared as to give an even greater witness in this respect than was given in 1945. Take every part of this service seriously and perform it as unto the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As each one strives to have a large share in these privileges of service let him bear in mind that all such is only a means to an end; it is merely the ‘hunting and fishing’ for the “other sheep&quot;. Having found them, we must feed them. That means making back-calls. If every publisher would call back on each obtainer of a subscription, bound book, or booklet, as admonished in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font4"> what a peak of back-calls we should have! How many book studies would be started! how many would become convinced that this is Indeed the truth! and then how many would start giving testimony to Jehovah’s supremacy! What an increase that would bring in publishers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do we appreciate the great honor, the rare privilege of being members of or companions of the “people for the issue” ? To the extent that we do we will strive during the month of May to make known to as many as we possibly can what the issue is and where we stand in regard thereto.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">This is a reminder that in all cases possible pioneers should try to order </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> with freight orders for literature that will come to 100 pounds or more. (Of course, this applies to small company orders also.) By shipping such orders by freight, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> may then be included at very little extra shipping expense. Avoid, as far as possible, ordering </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> without literature, or even with literature when the entire shipment will weigh less than a freight shipment. Such orders involve considerable additional shipping expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If a company or another pioneer plans to send in an order for literature, you may include with it your order for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Netcs.</span><span class="font4"> In the event you wish to order </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom </span><span class="font4">.Veits for other pioneers in your group, you should always show for how many pioneers you are ordering; otherwise the regular charge will be made for the quantity you order over 1,000 copies.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>For Brethren Out on Parole</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The Board of Parole has indicated its willingness for our brethren who are out on parole to attend the convention at Cleveland August 4-11. It is necessary for each one, however, to obtain permission from the local probation officer having jurisdiction over him. An application for permission should be made early. If the probation officer does not grant permission for one to leave his district, then such one should write directly to the Board of Parole, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., requesting such permission.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Clothing Shipments</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The Society has been able to secure shipping space and ship several hundred thousand pounds of used clothing, bedding and shoes to European countries for the relief of the brethren in the war areas. This clothing was supplied by the companies in the northeastern part of the United States at the Society’s request. The brethren were very liberal and generous in providing these things, and the supply has been adequate. No more clothing should be gathered by the brethren for shipment to Europe unless the Society advises the company servants of certain companies to that effect. Please do not send clothing to Brooklyn unless requested to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the brethren throughout the country have made inquiries concerning clothing they have which they wish to donate for the use of the brethren. The only suggestion we have is that the individual publishers who have clothing they do not plan to use themselves might be able to give some assistance to the pioneers working in near-by territories by providing them with clothing. The Society will not handle clothing for the pioneers; that is left to the individuals who may have it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Vacation Pioneers</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>‘Remember Your Creator’ by Full-Time Service</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Consecration, whether made by mature persons or by children of school age, embodies rendering everything we have in service to Jehovah. It means that our thoughts, desires and efforts are directed first each day toward honoring our Creator. During the school year young brethren delight to spend week-ends and evenings in Kingdom service. In May or June school work ends for several mouths, making it possible for hundreds of boys and girls to enjoy every day a full share in the vital vindication work. To all publishers of school age this question is put: “What will you do during your vacation?” Surely no consecrated child of the King will desire to follow the foolish course of worldly youth, wasting time in idleness, getting into trouble as delinquents, or merely ‘playing’ unprofitably from morning till night. Rather he will endeavor to ‘redeem the time’, remembering his Creator daily as a summer vacation pioneer. This is reasonable service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Requirements</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Summer pioneer service will not be easy. It requires diligent thought and careful planning, and sticking to a schedule in order to meet the quota of 150 hours a month. It will mean house-to-house work on hot, uncomfortable days, keeping an accurate record of work done in your territory, making back-calls, doing street work, advertising public meetings, and at the end of the month adding up and sending to this office promptly your complete service report. Moreover, like the year-round pioneer, you will encounter many difficulties, becoming the daily target of Satan and his demons, who hate the Lord’s little ones. At all times the young pioneer must put implicit trust in Jehovah, be serious-minded, and deport himself as a fully mature minister of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of tender years will need to accompany their parents, who may be general or special pioneers, in tlie service; others may desire to work with a summer pioneer partner living near by; or, if no partner is available, they will witness alone, realizing that the Lord’s protective power operates toward them every minute. The summer pioneer will serve as a direct representative of the Society, receiving six copies of each issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> a territory assignment (you may work in the territory you select), and any correspondence sent to general pioneers. Literature should be obtained at pioneer rates from another pioneer; no account will be opened for you at this office, in that you are able to pioneer during only a few months. You should be familiar with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> follow the counsel contained therein, and co-operate to the fullest extent witli the company organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In August many summer pioneers will attend the Assembly, to be the recipients of rich blessings. And when school re-opens they can again take up study with the happy thought that their vacation has been, not one of laziness and inactivity, but one of daily remembrance of their Maker, by active, wholehearted participation in the greatest work of all time. What will </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font4"> do this summer? Re-read the November 15,1945, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Discuss this with your parents. Make it a matter of prayer. We shall be glad, on your request, to send you an application blank and further details, and aid you in every way to enjoy the glorious treasure of full-time service this summer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER, 1946 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Be glad, ye nations, with his people.”—Rom. 15: 10, Roth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BROOKLYN, N.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The “Nations’ Gladness” Testimony Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Share Gladness by Spreading Message of Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And again he saith, Be glad, ye nations, with his people”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Organize for Intensive Campaign with New Booklet</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During this season of the year it is customary to give expression to sentiments of peace and good-will. Yet, what do we find? Instead of genuine good-will and co-operation within and between the nations, we see strife and confusion, suspicion and hate on every hand, in every land. Little wonder that the peoples are not glad!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But there is one people that is glad today: the nation whose God is Jehovah. Why are they glad? Because they know that Jehovah has begun to reign ; that Satan and his demons have been cast out of heaven; that soon he and all having his spirit will bite the dust; and that then there will be a rule of righteousness and peace of which there will be no end, all to the vindication of Jehovah's name. That is the cause of this nation’s gladness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We, who are members of that glad nation, shall we keep our gladness to ourselves? To do so would be to lose it, for we must share our gladness with others if we would keep it. In fact, by sharing it with others we increase in gladness! And how can we share our joy with others now? By placing the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Prince of Peace&quot;, </span><span class="font3">which shows why we are a glad nation, in the hands of as many as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So that this booklet may have the widest possible distribution, the initial offer to be presented at the door will be seven on a contribution of twenty-five cents. Impress all with the inportance of this message and their privilege of having a share in spreading it. If unable to place seven, present three on a contribution of ten cents, and finally one on a five-cent contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Companies should arrange for group witnessing, daytime and evenings, weekdays and Sundays. Secular work stoppages due to holidays, season’s vacations or other causes should be utilized to the full. Also let publishers obtain territory near their homes so as to be able to take advantage of their spare hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Prince of Peace&quot;</span><span class="font3"> distribution during December, all Kingdom publishers will share their gladness with others by continuing diligently to make back-calls and conduct book studies, engage in street magazine work and support the public meeting campaign. By every one of these means let all men know that gladness dwells in our land. (Brethren not receiving their supplies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace&quot;</span><span class="font3"> should press ahead with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">other </span><span class="font3">booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Contains Timely and Comforting Message</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the recent Glad Nations Assembly our enthusiasm and joy repeatedly overflowed as we heard the thrilling talk “Fearless Against the World Conspiracy” on Tuesday, the stirring “Resolution” on Saturday, and the comforting public discourse on Sunday, “The Prince of Peace.” All these messages, so clearly and forcibly dealing with the issues before the world today, are now available in the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The people want peace and osten-: sibly their leaders are working for peace. But in vain do they look to the Vatican for peace. Why? Because “Jehovah God will never permit a mere man on earth ... to accomplish . . . what the Most High has appointed Christ Jesus, the real Prince of Peace, to do”. And why will Jehovah God not bless their efforts? Because “the vindication of God’s own word and name will not permit him to bless the world conspiracy with success to the glory of men of this world”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But the Prince of Peace will succeed where others have failed. Why? Because (and again we quote) “Christ Jesus in his capacity as High Priest of God and by means of his redemptive sacrifice for mankind will bring to all his obedient subjects on earth the peace of God that passeth all understanding because of the forgiveness and actual taking away of sins. By his allpower in heaven and earth he will . . . enforce the rule of righteousness among all men everywhere. He will cultivate in their hearts the unselfish love of what is right and just. This is not . . . wishful thinking. It is a reality, at the door. Everlasting peace by the government of the Prince of Peace is a certainty in the near future”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Further, the booklet points out the folly of going with the majority merely because it is such, for “the majority of the people have again and again been wrong”, and then cites examples. After giving the setting of and citing the warning, &quot;Say ye not, a conspiracy,” it highlights the assurance of the small minority on the right side: “For God is with us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Never has it been more imperative that the servants of Jehovah unequivocally and fearlessly state their position than at the present time, when the world conspiracy has come to the fore. Never have the people been in greater need of the clear, forceful and heart-cheering message contained in this booklet than now, in these days of disillusionment. Will you do your part?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">All-Time High in Publishers Will Result from Practical Aid</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Distributing the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace”,</span><span class="font3"> engaging in magazine, back-call and bookstudy activity and supporting the public meetings are various ways in which we share our gladness with others. However, we could do all such and still come short of our privileges. What more is required? We must share our </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gladness in field service</span><span class="font3"> with others by taking them with us. In fact, that is the chief point to be stressed this month— an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all-time high in publishers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An all-time high in publishers? Is such a thing possible? and if so, how can we attain it? First, if all the irregular publishers in this country would take part in the field service during December and then report the same it would be attained. Further, if the special offer of thirty booklets on a contribution of one dollar is presented to each subscriber for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">to each one on our back-call lists, to all our book studies, and to all associated with the companies but not as yet publishing, there will be an all-time high in publishers. So an all-time high is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How shall we assist all these to have a share in spreading the Nation’s gladness and thus realize our goal? By stressing booklet distribution at the service meetings? Good, but not enough. Besides, many of these do not attend the service meetings. Then, too, there are many who know that the privilege awaits them but do not feel impelled to do something about it. What else is required? We must give them practical aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To give such practical aid we must ask them to come with us and see our unselfish and joyous zeal for Jehovah. All servants and other capable and dependable publishers, therefore, should be assigned to get in touch with all back-calls, book studies, subscribers for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazines, and all irregular and delinquent publishers, either at the meetings or at their homes. Approach them tactfully, and in a kind and friendly manner suggest their joining you in group witnessing some evening or on a week-end. Do not become discouraged if circumstances repeatedly interfere, but patiently continue to manifest your interest in them. Take for granted that they will appreciate your sincere desire to help them to have more Kingdom gladness. And while aiding others, parents should not overlook their own children, but rather be diligent to apply the instruction given in the recent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> along this line, thus providing them real security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Share your gladness of field serv-</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Successful Pioneering</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Requires Careful Planning</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Among the many occupations that one might undertake, none requires more careful planning and diligent effort for success than the full-time pioneer service. Certainly no vocation is more deserving of such effort. While faith is essential, it is only by the application of that faith in intelligent planning and diligent effort that successful and continuous pioneering will result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With 150 or more hours each month to be devoted in house-to-house witnessing, magazine work, public meeting activity, and conducting back-calls and book studies, in addition to time expended in caring for company matters and personal study, it can readily be seen that no mere ‘hit or miss’ arrangement will be sufficient. The successful pioneer, having planned his work, will rise early and devote at least six hours during the day and evening to the field witnessing, in addition to the hour allowed for travel, for at least six days of the week. That leaves one full day each week and many hours each day for individual study, attending meetings and caring for personal needs such as meals, washing clothes, house cleaning, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This requires much work. However, when entering the pioneer service one should determine to be as regular and dependable in his vocation as he would be in a secular job, if not more so. The joys and blessings of continued service will never be the lot of one who pioneers a few months, stops for two or three months, and then pioneers a few more months. The real accomplishment is through steady work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Suspension</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Occasionally circumstances will arise whereby the pioneer is unable to meet the 150-hour requirement for a month or two, such as illness or breakdown of equipment. At times it may be necessary for a pioneer to take a week or two off for recuperation physically or for secular work, thus enabling him to continue in full-time service. In such instances a request may be made for suspension from the pioneer requirements. The Society will determine if suspension may be granted, depending upon the pioneer’s previous activity and the circumstances involved, and will advise accordingly. This applies to all pioneers, whether they be general pioneers or special pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers requesting suspension should have been averaging around the quota of 150 hours per month during the year (special pioneers must be averaging their quota of 175 hours per month), and in no</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font3"> 2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">column 2) </span><span class="font3">ice by giving practical aid to all lovers of truth and righteousness. Have the children join with you in spreading gladness. Doing so, we shall have an all-time high in publishers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Unspotted for Service of Praise”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Double-featured Subscription Campaign Opens</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Watchtower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to Be Weekly Reading Habit</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Serious thought upon our text for January will do much to prepare us for what will without doubt be the greatest subscription campaign to date. This matter of being “unspotted” receives a great deal of attention from the Lord. It is also referred to as being washed, renovated and transformed, all of which means a putting away of the old world from our lives and replacing It with the service of praise. To the extent that anyone willingly retains the spirit of the old world, to that extent he spots and retards his service of praise. We must more and more shed old world contacts and take on the new. The progress in this unspotted condition can be measured by our increase in the service of praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The greatest instrument of praise to Jehovah in the earth today Is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Do you believe that to be a fact? Do you really want to praise Jehovah? If your answers are yes, then your course of action is simple: use all the time you usually devote to Kingdom service to place </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in the hands of the people, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">then </span><span class="font3">redeem, buy back all of the time you possibly can from old world pursuits and devote that time to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">January begins a four-month campaign to place in the hands of the people everywhere </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a Theocratic magazine every week.</span><span class="font3"> This must become the reading habit of those who will live in the New World. That will mean New World instruction and praise to Jehovah on the greatest scale yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Present Two-Magazine Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The initial campaign offer is to be one year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and one year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> and any two of the Society's latest bound books on a subscription rate of $2.00. Present this offer witli enthusiasm </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font3"> in every case. All of the Lord’s consecrated people realize that they need the mixed but balanced diet contained in these two magazines for their own good. This food is just as essential to people of good-will. It is our job to see that they have the opportunity to get it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You will, of course, present </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font3"> in every instance where they do not already have it, as part of this combination, and then make every possible effort to get a study started in that book. This will greatly aid the people in assimilating the truth contained in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Where they cannot take the entire combination, then drop to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and a bound book on a contribution of one dollar. Keep in mind that this is a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign. If the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription offer is not accepted, then present some other appropriate combination that the circumstances might justify. But never drop to any other presentation until you have enthusiastically presented the two-magazine combination first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Organize in Advance</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The servants in the company will study carefully the Society’s circular “How to Properly Handle Subscriptions”, of January 1, 1946, and become very familiar with all the details. In addition, the company servant will arrange for some competent brother to take up at the service meeting such portions of this circular as apply to the publishers generally, for the instruction of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the double presentation in this 1947 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign, we anticipate a much greater increase than in previous years. Each servant should check the supplies of his department now to see that everything will be in readiness January 1, 1947, to open up a year of praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do not, however, order additional distributors’ copies of either magazine, in that, due to paper shortage, no distributor orders will be increased until further notice. If sample copies are needed, order the number required of each magazine, and back issues will be supplied at 2c per copy when available.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Ordering Handbills</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">It is important that companies order the same number of handbills for each talk of a public meeting series whenever possible; also order in even thousands, as this will greatly facilitate printing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font3"> 4) case should one apply for such unless he has been on the list and met the requirements for at least six months. Suspensions will not be granted for more than two months in a year, and will be limited to calendar months. This does not mean that one cannot re-enter the pioneer service if he has to take more time off, but, if such is needed, the Society will remove his name from the pioneer list until he sends in a new application for re-entering pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Requests for suspension, explaining the reason, should be sent to the Society by the 15th of the month preceding the month of suspension, and the Society will then advise whether or not such will be granted. While on suspension pioneers will receive only one copy of each issue of magazines. It is expected that those on suspension will devote as much time as possible to the service and endeavor to care for their book studies, reporting their activity to the Society on their pioneer report card at the end of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">each month</span><span class="font3"> as usual. At the bottom of the card the pioneer should state “Susi&gt;ension”. We will count such as company publishers, as in fact they are, and thus not drag down the pioneer average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to be replaced on the active list it will be necessary for a suspended pioneer to advise the Society by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">postal card</span><span class="font3"> by the 15th of the month prior to becoming active. Requests for suspension or information about becoming active should never be written on the bottom of the pioneer report card, but should always be sent separately. Pioneers on suspension who do not advise this office when they are going to become fully active will be removed from the pioneer list following the expiration of their suspension. Such persons as are removed may make application for re-entry as a pioneer when they are able to meet the pioneer requirements regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is hoped the above suggestions will enable pioneers to more effectively plan their work, for now, of all times, pioneering is a privileged vocation requiring faith in God and, beyond that, diligent works of service intelligently and carefully planned. Show your faith by your works, says James.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Blessing Attends “Awake!” Campaign</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Thousands Now in Line for Theocratic Instruction</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Throughout the entire country Jehovah’s people responded to October’s opportunity of obtaining </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions with a zeal that clearly manifested their gratitude for His provision of this new channel of Theocratic enlightenment. The quota of 50,000 subscriptions for the month was even surpassed, and now thousands of people of good-will are in position to receive regular instruction on the fulfillment of Bible prophecy as it applies to earth’s significant events. We are overjoyed to report that over 60,000 new English </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> campaign subscriptions have been received for the United States alone. The total from the world is over 80,000, with subscriptions still coming in. This indicates the everincreasing demand for the truth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>There Are Still Shortages</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">So that all the publishers may know the reasons for stockrooms’ not being supplied with all tlie literature the publishers may want, the following is stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For weeks there has been a shipping tie-up in New York, and due to this it may be that most companies and pioneers will not have the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace&quot;</span><span class="font3"> to work with during December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Future Shortages</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On account of the tremendous demand for literature in the countries of Europe since the war’s end, the Society will direct considerable paper supplies to the printing of foreign-language literature. This may cut in on the production of English literature in the United States, and if this occurs company publishers should use what stock they have in storage in the local witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today there is a greater paper shortage in the United States than at any time during the war. Those in the newspaper combine have gone “hog wild” on eating up paper, making their newspapers two or three times normal size and carrying full-page advertisements in many instances, with only five or six words on a page or just a picture and the name of a company or product. Newspapers are being served first by the paper mills and what is left goes to the small producer. The Society is still able to get some paper, but not in the quantities it desires to take care of its American and foreign printing work. This condition may last for six months, or maybe a year, and then paper supplies will probably go back to normal. Until then certain shortages may occur, especially in the United States, in booklets, and, maybe, books. This announcement is made now so that company servants will be prepared to organize their work so as to use what stock they have on hand if their orders are not filled. Companies should continue to order what they require, but if the Society finds it necessary to cut orders we will do so in order that pioneers in the United States may get the necessary supplies to keep them going; but if your order is cut advise the publishers to use what literature you have on hand until your new order is filled. If your company has a good supply of current literature, do not order more so as to have an excessive amount on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is doing everything possible under these hectic conditions to get paper and keep printing going. Until this unsettled con-Such desire for truth shows the marvelous opportunity now available for continually presenting </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> in vigorous magazine activity. Full use of these present opportunities will result in a continually increasing educational work to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who have manifested sufficient interest to subscribe for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> plainly indicated that they desire a knowledge of God’s Word. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> will awaken its readers to the need of additional and the more vitalizing spiritual food found in the columns of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer.</span><span class="font3"> Be prepared to supply this need by calling back and helping them to understand and appreciate the message of life as contained in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Make clear to them the purpose </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> has in view, so that in due time these “other sheep” also may join in the glad song.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This is no reason, however, to slack our hands, but it should make us more determined than ever to cover the field with what we have. All of us should follow up our placements of literature with back-calls and studies. We all have voices; let us make a joyful sound unto the Lord in fulfillment of the command to “praise Jehovah, all ye nations”.</span></p>

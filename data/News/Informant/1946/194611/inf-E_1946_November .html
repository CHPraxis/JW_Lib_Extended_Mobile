<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>New High in Publishers Possible</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah heigns ! The New World Government is established. The hour for vindication of God's sovereignty draws nigh. On earth only the remnant and their companions are aware of these world-shaking events. Only they know that the climax of the ages is upon us. But it is not for them alone to know. The world must know. The nations must be told. The peoples must learn that the end of wicked rule is at hand, that the reign of righteousness has begun, and the lives of millions hang in the balance. God's emphatic command to those who know, therefore, is that they “say [it] among the nations, Jehovah reigneth: the world also is established that it cannot be moved: he will judge the peoples with equity.” (Ps. 96:10, A. 8. F.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We, individually, who read this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> believe the foregoing facts. We know that the Kingdom has come, that Armageddon's war looms close, with multitudes yet to be reached. What, then, shall we do about it during November? Why, “Say it” 1 Speak out these truths! Tell it to your neighbors, to everyone in your territory, that the God of truth reigns and the heavenly kingdom is established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Everyone Say It with “Let God Be True”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What a shout of delight escaped the lips of 67,000 truth-lovers when </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> was released at Cleveland! Eagerly they scanned its pages. “What a gripping title! Look at the large, readable print. And the titles of the chapters— ‘Who Is Jehovah?’, ‘Hell, a Place of Rest in Hope,’ ‘The Church of God,’ ‘The New Earth.’ Why, these are the fundamental teachings of the Scriptures, the very subjects our good-will ask about. This will be an excellent preaching aid in our home territory.” And so it will be as November starts off its public distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the first new campaign book Since 1944 in our hands, and the stirring happenings of the Glad Nations Assembly still fresh in our minds, enthusiasm for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> activity should run high. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Everyone</span><span class="font2"> who believes that Jehovah reigns should “say it” with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> during November. Regular publishers, of course, will be on hand at the start. But what about irregular and inactive ones? or those of good-will who may have attended the assembly and read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”?</span><span class="font2"> Are there any such in your company? What can you, servants, regular publishers and pioneers, do to aid these this month? “Say it” to them. Call on them, offer your assistance, take them with you, at least once during November, to share in some feature of the Kingdom announcement with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font2"> and have them turn in a report. If diligent, concerted action to get everyone to “say it” during November is put forth, a new high in publishers is assuredly possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In placing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”, </span><span class="font2">the publisher has much to talk about. The table of “Contents” draws immediate attention. Let the householder scan this. The questions can be noted, together with the Scripture-text and subject indexes. Also, mention may be made of the fact that each chapter is complete in itself, one topic being thoroughly covered before the next begins; it is, as it were, 24 books in one. Reading the first paragraph or two of a chapter will rouse interest ; nothing dogmatic or prejudicial is presented, but material that invites the reader to “reason” on the subject. (Consider pages 7,57, 105,141, 243, 268.) Being familiar with the book’s contents and features, one can plan his presentation ; think out a fitting testimony, then “say it” at the door, with good effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As noted in the October </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> the book and a booklet will be offered on a contribution of 25c, and distributed in conjunction with intensive public meeting work, especially in outlying sections of the territory. If you do not have a supply of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font2"> then use some other late book that you have in stock. The “Thanksgiving holiday” this month will permit many school publishers and grownups further opportunity to proclaim Jehovah’s reign. Group witnessing should be arranged for this day. With all these vitalizing inducements to service, November should witness an all-time high in number of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> demonstrations at service meetings may be arranged. These need not be elaborate, but should be given thought, planning and rehearsal. Demonstrations should always be Theocratic, practical, and high-light points for field-service use. Those taking part should care well for their assignments, while the company servant may offer counsel as to Its presentation. Good demonstrations make for lively, instructive meetings and more effective service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow Up Each Book Placement</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every obtainer of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> should be called back on within two weeks after the book has been left. As stressed at Cleveland, the new book will prove a source of more book studies. Beople of good-will “take” to it; they want to study it, and the more they read the more absorbing it gets. Take advantage of this God-given provision for “feeding the sheep”. Call back, show them how to study, and explain the “free education” you</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Follow Pattern of Jehovah’s Approved Servants</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Setting the example for effective gospel-preaching, Christ Jesus and later the faithful apostles gathered the people together in groups on every possible occasion, and there expounded God's word in earnest, inspiring and moving language. This same approved procedure was also followed by the devoted prophets of old. In fact, in all ages the public platform has been one of the chief means utilized to acquaint others with those truths vital to the true worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now that the crisis of the ages is upon men, and the proclamation of Jehovah's purposes concerning i these all-important times is so absolutely essential, the public meeting feature of Kingdom service will be vigorously advanced by everyone who sincerely desires to use his powers of speech to Jehovah’s praise as expressly commanded by Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">How Everyone Can Participate</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The success of the public meetings in your own company territory actually lies in the combined effort of everyone in the company. It depends primarily on the support given, first in advertising and then in attending each meeting. If only a few persons of good-will attend after promises were made by so many, don’t become discouraged and conclude that there is no use of putting forth further effort. Keep on and on. Put on many series from the Kingdom Hall and the outlying sections of territory. Advertise faithfully and continually. Follow up the interest. As gospelpreachers fulfill your God-given as-</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Surely we rejoice to be alive now, and share daily in vindication work. We want with all our heart to honor Jehovah, and help others know that God is true to his Word and that eternal blessings are at hand. During this month, let nothing crowd out your New World service.

<p><span class="font2">Then, of course, there is the lecture itself. How earnestly Christ Jesus and his zealous apostles contended for the faith! Call to mind also the moving zealousness with which Noah, Moses, Isaiah and Jeremiah called upon men of good-will to serve the great Creator and live. Copy these faithful examples, knowing that God’s spirit will direct you also as you use every means now provided by the Society to effectively preach the gospel. Keep your talks alive and appealing with information taken from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Awake! “Equipped for Every Good Work”,</span><span class="font2"> and all the applied knowledge from the Society's publicspeaking aids. Become efficient preachers of God’s Word, making every public meeting fully worth attending. Speakers, put forth your very best endeavor.

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>The Announcement</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Was Made at Cleveland</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">At the Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly Brother Knorr outlined the arrangement whereby the .Society will Issue notes to the brethren asking for them in reference to the additions to the factory and Bethel home in Brooklyn. There are some inquiries coming to us as to when the Society will publish such information in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">or otherwise make printed announcement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is to advise that there will be no such published announcement. The arrangement was outlined in detail at the convention, and, in accordance therewith, brethren interested have been writing to the office of the treasurer of the Society since that time, and we are still hearing from brethren who want notes. There is no necessity of a further announcement, as the amount has been oversubscribed. We have nearly completed the work of taking subscriptions, and we believe we have heard from everyone desiring notes, or w ill have heard very soon now, by December 1 at the latest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society will close its books on subscriptions for notes December 31 and decide how much will be allotted to each subscriber. We will not accept any subscriptions following that date. Those who received the information at the assembly are fully informed and know what procedure to follow if they wish notes. No announcement or details will be published, except to those subscribing for notes.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Organize for All-Time High in Publishers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The month of December will witness world-wide religious-commercial propagandizing of a glittering tinsel-draped ‘good-will toward men’. But how can such pagan-originated custom bring gladness when people are facing starvation, when there exists oppression of races, nations and classes, and when there is near economic chaos in the ‘land of opportunity and plenty'? There is a gladness available today, but it does not stem from artificial sources. This gladness is genuine. It comes from the true sources of gladness, Jehovah the “God of Peace” and Christ Jesus the “Prince of Peace”, and is being extended to all peoples and races in the rousing invitation, “Be glad, ye nations, with his people.” And the gladness caused by a knowledge of God's merciful provisions is lasting, as contrasted with the vanishing pseudogladness of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is time the attention of the people be directed to a true source of peace. How appropriate it is, then, for Jehovah's witnesses to devote the “Nations’ Gladness&quot; Testimony Period to the distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace”.</span><span class="font2"> This 64-page colored-cover booklet, containing the two talks “The Prince of Peace” and “Tearless Against the World Conspiracy&quot;, plus two short treatises, will carry to millions of people the same spirit of peace and gladness that prevailed during the Glad Nations Assembly. It clearly explains why there is no real peace today and shows just how and when it will come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace”</span><span class="font2"> should have a tremendous distribution during December. It will have, if everyone prepares now to take part. Companies and pioneers have been advised to order a supply of booklets. All subscribers for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> are being invited to share in this service, being offered 30 booklets on contribution of .$1.00. Without a doubt, many of these people will respond to the invitation appearing in the magazines. Of course, those subscribers associated with a company will obtain their supply from the local organization. All publishers, all persons of goodwill listed in the back-call file and all magazine subscribers should be reminded of the part they may have in putting out copies of this important message. Announcement may be made at the end of each public lecture during December to the effect that those attending may obtain 30 booklets on a .$1.00 contribution and distribute them among their friends. The call has been going forth throughout the year for those of the nations to be glad with God’s people. Now everyone who has heeded this call may aid others by-taking to them </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">genuine</span><span class="font2"> cheer and gladness, and thus bring about an all-time high in number of publishers during December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Organize for New High In Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What a great help this booklet will be to millions of people! What cause for rejoicing if we reach an all-time high in number of publishers while distributing it! And why not? We have been strengthened by the recent assembly. We have had Impressed upon us the urgency of the message. Now let us organize for distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">First, the servants in the company-must prepare, by planning and outlining this great December campaign well in advance. Group work during the day and evenings will be planned and territory lined up. The publishers’ records will be checked and plans will be made for the systematic contacting of all irregular publishers as well as those inactive persons who associate with the company and arranging to assist them, providing them with booklets. Also, the servants will cheek and make use of the back-call file so that all persons of good-will whose names appear therein, as well as magazine subscribers, will be called on and reminded of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace”</span><span class="font2"> distribution. This may take much work, but we should be glad to do it. Think of how many-more persons will receive a witness during December if all of those visited share in the distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The servants should arrange effective demonstrations on the presentation of this booklet in the various features of the work for service meetings the latter part of November and the early part of December. As soon as the distribution is under way, brethren should present their experiences showing the results Thus the campaign will be thoroughly prepared for and followed up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Next, the co-operation of the publishers. The plans having been outlined by the servants at service meetings, the publishers should take seriously their privilege and responsibility to contact weak publishers or inactive persons upon the direction of the servants, as yvell as those on back-call lists and the magazine subscribers. The publisher will offer to provide these with 3(1 booklets on contribution of $1.00, enabling them to place such with others. In addition, the publishers will give personal attention to aiding these persons in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is the organization needed for an all-time high in publishers, as well as a very- extensive distribution. It will not be easy. It will require hard work. It will mean devoting days, evenings and weekends to house-to-house and back-call work. But who, with such a message of gladness, would want to hold back? Let the entire month, including the “holiday” period, be devoted to the carrying forward of the message in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace” </span><span class="font2">will be the exclusive house-to-house offer during December. This contains the message we have for the people during this month. Show the interested person at the door his privilege of sharing the message with friends. The offer is 7 copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace&quot;</span><span class="font2"> on contribution of 25c, or 3 on a 10c contribution. Remember this is a distribution offer and if they wish to contribute $1.00 to the work, let them have 30 booklets. If they just wish a single copy, let them have it on contributing 5c. Have in mind calling back later, at which time you will bring the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The booklet should also be offered in the street work, in conjunction with magazine witnessing. Evening booklet work should be arranged for. Every effort will be put forth to provide for the highest number of publishers and the widest distribution of booklets in any month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Near the end of December, all</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Field Service Report</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">At the recent Glad Nations Assembly the issue of world conspiracy or the kingdom of God was clearly drawn and Jehovah's servants were shown as a unified body of Christians 100 percent for Jehovah’s kingdom and fearless in spite of that conspiracy. For eight days they enjoyed a spiritual feast of “meat in due season&quot;. This- Theocratic source of nourishment and strength was provided to enable each one of them to serve courageously, effectively and zealously under the banner of the Prince of Peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So that each company of Jehovah’s witnesses may keep prominently before them their activity and see to what extent they are keeping up with their quotas, the chart has been provided and is now being mailed to the companies. Use it for self-examination and to mark your progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Further, so that each company may be advised of the progress of the work throughout the country and compare their own activity with it, the field service report is published each month in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font2">The report for the month of September, the first month of the new service year is given below.

<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Consecration Means Service</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Among the many joys experienced by those attending the Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly was that of witnessing 2,602 men, women and children give public testimony of their having taken an unequivocal stand for Jehovah and his kingdom. And why did they make this consecration to do God’s will? First of all, because of faith. They had the firm conviction that Jehovah God actually exists and that he does reward all them that diligently seek him. They had abiding confidence in God's Word as true, and therefore heeded the admonition found therein: “My son, give me thine heart.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">They took this step also because they realized it to be the course of wisdom. They appreciated that it is not in man to direct his steps: that even when perfect he had but a limited amount of wisdom, and now has much less, besides having all the imperfections and fallen tendencies due to sin. They realized that the only truly wise thing is to put their affairs into the hands of Him who knows best and who is glad to direct them in all their paths, namely, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Doing God’s Will</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Note that theirs was a consecration to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font2"> God’s will. Merely giving a mental assent to the existence of Jehovah God would not have been sufficient; the demons do that too, and tremble. These 2,602 persons went on record as going beyond that by agreeing to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font2"> something about it, to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font2"> whatever is His will for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And what does it mean to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">do </span><span class="font2">God’s will at the present time? It means: Casting up defense through knowledge, collaboration in reconstructive work, remembering the Creator in the days of vigor, purging out religion, singing unto the Lord the new song, and saying among the nations that Jehovah reigns. To do these things effectively and in unity the Lord has provided </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions,</span><span class="font2"> the. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> the weekly service meetings, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Putting your unequivocal stand for Jehovah and his kingdom into practical operation means service in the field. It means witnessing publicly on the street corners with the magazines and the handbills advertising the public meetings, and supporting the public meetings further by calling for the good-will interest as well as attending the lectures yourself; it means going from house to house with the Kingdom message in printed form (with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font2"> during the month of November), calling back on all interest found and arranging for book studies wherever possible; it means engaging in the route and store-to-store magazine work: and it means assisting the newly interested ones to get out in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Further, consecration to do God’s will means </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">regularity</span><span class="font2"> in field service, Saturdays, Sundays, and midweek ; it means </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">persistency</span><span class="font2"> in field service, continuing therein regardless of conditions; it means ever </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">improving</span><span class="font2"> your field service; and it means </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">joyful</span><span class="font2"> service. Consecration means all that and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Consecration means service.</span></p>

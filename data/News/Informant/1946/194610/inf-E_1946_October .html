<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Wake Up More than 50,000 Persons with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Present world planners continue to sing their old song over and over again. They attempt a slight variation, a new key, and different lyrics, but they still produce the same old discordant and doleful tune of international collaboration. And no wonder! Only Jehovah deserves a new song! It is only what </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">he</span><span class="font3"> has done that is worthy of being sung in joyful tunes. His deeds, being distinctively new to humankind, supply a new theme for the new song. No cheap man-made song is this. No. but Jehovah supplies the truths which make up the theme of the song. The theme, new in the chronicles of humankind, is that Jehovah has taken his sovereign power over the earth and is now reigning through the Kingdom. Now it is up to us to awake to the rousing call “Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song!”—Ps. 98:1, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A. S. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Indeed Jehovah has graciously supplied the truths for the new song. It is time for the people to be awakened to such. Alert to this fact, the Lord’s servants will be awake and awaken others in October by obtaining subscriptions for the new magazine </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> The subscription rate will be $1.00 per year. Differing from other subscription campaigns there will be no book premium given. This is strictly an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> campaign, and it is hoped that more than 50,000 subscriptions for this magazine will he obtained during the one month of October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Awake!&quot;—What Does It Offer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How enthused all were when </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> was released! How impressed with the first article of the first issue, “Wake Up, World!” And as we look through the magazine we appreciate how apt it will he in showing the difference between the joyful and magnificent “New Song” of Jehovah's deeds and the cheap, shallow, worn-out song of would-be world peacemakers. Make no mistake about it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> is an entirely new magazine from cover to cover. It is not an old magazine with a new face. It directs its attention to waking up the people, to showing them what is going on, and to alerting them to the vital issues of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The Mission” (on page 2) is an excellent talking point. Show the people how </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Atcakc!</span><span class="font3"> has no fetters, but is free to print facts; how it uses news channels, supplemented by its own correspondents from all continents and scores of nations. Its pages cover many fields of knowledge—government, commerce, religion, history, geography, science, social conditions, and natural wonders. It exposes subtle dangers and reflects the hope of a righteous world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then there is the table of contents, showing the articles of the current issue. The feature “Thy Word Is Truth”, with its Scriptural subject, will be of interest. Or “Watching the World”, with its world-wide news digest. Yes, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">is new, it is up to date. The publisher will never be at a loss to present its advantages for the reader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">All-out Campaign Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This one-month campaign requires immediate work. No waiting until the month is over before the publishers wake up to the campaign. Having ordered sufficient supplies of magazines, having lined up territory for witnessing, every publisher should be in the field with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">from October 1 until October 31. Those brethren who were full-time ‘singers’ during vacation should not cease their good work, but should present this offer evenings, weekends and all times. Good-will persons should be encouraged to have a few extra copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> which they will give to their friends, trying to obtain subscriptions from them, thereby joining in singing the “New Song”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> will be presented at the door throughout October. If the people are unable to obtain a year’s subscription, offer a six-month subscription for 50c. Then drop down to a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> with a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Wateh-toicer</span><span class="font3"> magazine and a booklet, on a 10c contribution. At least endeavor to leave a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> in every home on a 5c contribution. Remember too, keep your House to House Record and call back on all obtain-ers of the magazine to see if they wish to have it regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">October should witness evening </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> work too. New publishers should be taken in this evening work and assisted to get a magazine route started. They will call back with each issue of the magazine trying to further that person's interest, presenting the subscription offer also in this work at every opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Regular street witnessing will be stimulated by the magazine. Already brethren report an increase in placements, as a result of the people’s interest in this new magazine. Keep up their interest by being alert. Know what is going on. Don’t let street work slump into a “silent testimony&quot; or lifeless repetition of some trite phrase. Be up to date. Use the headings of the articles for slogans. Use points from the articles to arouse interest. Make short pithy statements about some of the news found in “W a t c h i n g the World”. Tell it out about the hope of a righteous world. Be positive but tactful, using good judgment in calling out the slogans. A few suggestions are here given for the use of the brethren, in addition to the above-stated suggestions, but these should not become stereotyped in their use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Awake!</span><span class="font3"> is free to publish facts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Awake!</span><span class="font3"> is awake to world conditions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Keep awake by reading </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!” “Awake!</span><span class="font3"> views behind the news.” “Awake to the hope of a righteous world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“World news in review.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Further, a short announcement regarding the subscription may be made at the close of each public talk during October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the doors, on the streets, riding on trains or busses, or just visiting friends or relatives, urge all persons to keep awake by reading </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">Wherever you are join harmoniously in the swelling chorus now singing the “New Song”. “Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.” Make October a banner month. Not at a later date, not at a ‘more convenient time’, but as the apostle says, “Now it is high time to awake!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneering—a Vocation for Those Who Have Faith</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Expansion Calls for More Full-Time Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘The basic requirement for pioneer service is </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">faith.’</span><span class="font3"> That was the firm conviction of thousands of pioneer-minded ministers a f t er hearing Brother Knorr's stirring discourse “Equipped for Every Good Work”. ‘Does not Jehovah own heaven and earth? Does not he care for the birds of the air and beasts of the field? Has he not promised that to those who “seek first the kingdom&quot; needed food, shelter and clothing shall be provided? Of course he has. But the publisher must believe that promise. He must have </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">faith,</span><span class="font3"> and let God prove true to his word that he will sustain his pioneer servant, daily.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here was the answer, clear-cut, convincing. Scriptural, to those who have asked, “How much money must I save first? Do I need a car and trailer? How can I be sure of food and clothing?” Satisfied that faith in God, and not stored-up material wealth, is the thing required, hundreds of brethren at Cleveland, young and old, single and married, asked for pioneer applications. These and the scores who have written in since the Assembly, armed now with unshakable faith, are going to take God at his word and make pioneering their vocation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers Share in Expansion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the pioneer that must spearhead the expansion of the Kingdom</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>“The Prince of Peace”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">New Booklet for December Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The month of December will be devoted to the distribution of the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace”. </span><span class="font3">This will be a 64-page colored-cover booklet containing the talks “The Prince of Peace” and “Fearless Against the World Conspiracy”, as well as a section on “Warning” and another on “Resolution”. All during December this booklet will be the main offer, being left on a contribution of 5c per copy. Those who heard the talks at the Assembly will keenly appreciate the importance of getting this message into the hands of the people as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Companies and pioneers may order now, so that they will have sufficient supplies on hand for the December campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in Foreign Languages</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many brethren are wondering when </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> will be published in foreign languages, as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font3">has been. It is necessary to prepare plates for headings and also to comply with postal regulations when such change is made. Be assured that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> will be available in all the languages in which </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> has been published just as soon as it can be arranged, and announcements of such changes will be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">witness into foreign fields, and there lay the groundwork for reconstruction of the true worship. Hundreds of full-time ministers, including many who first began service in response to the pioneer call at St. Louis, and even following the ‘Jephthah’s Daughter' drama in 1942, are now Gilead graduates singing forth the New Song in other lands. Hundreds more will yet be selected to share in the vital expansion activity, from among pioneers today who hold fast their faith and do with their might the good work of gospel-publishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To share in the expanding Kingdom work, however, the pioneer is not required to move into foreign territory. The United States is fertile land for reaping the fruitage of pioneer preaching. At least 22,000,000 persons in this country were not witnessed to in 1915. In many counties there is not one publisher. Large cities await pioneers, for proper coverage, while companies scattered throughout America, north, south, east and west, write to the Society’s office daily and say, “Please send us pioneer help.” The Society keenly feels its responsibility to oversee the spreading of “this gospel” into every section of the United States and the world. And. by God's grace, the appeal voiced at the Assembly for unencumbered. consecrated publishers to break off from old-world restraints, awake to their privileges</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Say what? </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Say among the nations. Jehovah reigneth: the world also is established that it cannot be moved: he will judge the peoples with equity.”</span><span class="font3"> (Ps. 96:10, 4. ft'. K) This, then, is the “new song” that Jehovah’s servants are commanded to sing. Its keynote: the paramount issue of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty. It rings with the truth that “Jehovah hath become King!” and also that the New World shall be completely established. This inspired shout-command is for the “glad nations” to invite men of all nations to declare with them, “Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.” In fact, it narrows down to our own locality and individual selves. Wherever we live on this earth we must send forth the cry “Jehovah . . . reigneth” and carry forth the challenge “Let God be true”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">November’s Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">November will have as its feature the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”. </span><span class="font3">Just think, this is the first new book we have had to offer the public in two years I It is indeed food for starving millions, and the populace of the “glad nations” is favored to let the whole world know that Jehovah reigns, and to have this instrument to use in doing so.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC MEETING CAMPAIGN</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark10"><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings Held </span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Care in Ordering</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren should keep in mind ordering sufficient literature to make up a 100-pound shipment whenever possible. Also, pioneers should endeavor to combine their orders with the company order. In such cases, the pioneer orders should be attached to the company order and be mailed with it. Considerable time is wasted when a pioneer order comes in with a request to send such with the company order sent in a few days prior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some pioneers and companies have ordered large quantities of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”, </span><span class="font3">apparently thinking such is campaign literature. This book is published primarily for the publisher, for his own study and use in preaching the gospel; also for the assistance of many persons of good-will. It is not a campaign book yet: hence it should not be presented as an offer from house to house, but only on back-calls. In most instances, the larger orders for pioneers and some companies have been cut. There is only one rate on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good &quot;Work”, </span><span class="font3">namely 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">to give a thorough witness in these towns, and no better way can be found than by starting public meetings in them. To get well under way in November will require prompt action in getting an appropriate place to hold the meetings. Line up your speakers and order handbills immediately. Small companies probably can handle only one series in November; the larger can start two or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In working these outlying towns, work long hours and hard. Experienced publishers will find this an excellent means of breaking in new publishers and instructing them as to how to best present the message and to overcome barriers. When working, take careful note of interest shown and arrange to call for them; take them to the meeting and acquaint them with other brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Much interest will be found in these out-of-the-way places. After you make the Initial contact, call back as many times as possible, starting a study in the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font3"> If weather or transportation hindrances prevent your return for a while, urge them to study the book themselves, or with others, using the questions on each page to aid them. Where personal contact is impossible, keep in touch by mail, showing your interest in their welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> is particularly provided by Jehovah that the good-will people of all nations may learn “the first principles of Christ” and be judged on the “right” side of the King. What better way could there be to ‘say among the nations that Jehovah reigns’, that He is the true and faithful God, than to say it by works with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God. Be True”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention Photographs</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many of the brethren have inquired if it is possible to get some photographs of the Glad Nations Assembly. For the convenience of those that want them the Society has made a selection of six different actual photographs, 8&quot;xl0&quot; in size, glossy finish, of the following scenes:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. Wide-angle view of the inside of the Stadium.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. View of the beautiful platform.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. Aerial view of the Stadium.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. Aerial view of the trailer camp.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. Aerial view of the immersion scene.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">6. Compound p i c tu r e showing three of the surprise releases.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">These should prove useful in telling people of good-will about tlie Glad Nations Assembly. The brethren can order as many of each as they desire. They are available on a contribution of 25 cents each or six prints to one address for one dollar. Remittance must accompany all orders. Company or unit servants should arrange to take the brethren's orders and then, adding them together, should send in one order to I the Society specifying the total quantity desired of each number. Pioneers can place their orders with local companies or, if isolated, they can send in their orders direct. ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Note</span><span class="font3"> : Order by number. Send these orders entirely separate from any other matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition the Society has made arrangements to supply a large-size picture of the Stadium, 20&quot; x 30&quot;. This can be framed under glass and hung up in the Kingdom Hall to show the “stranger” that many</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Servant to the Brethren Activity Outlined</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Along with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> the Society is sending the new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Amendments to Organization Instructions. </span><span class="font3">Each publisher having the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Organi-zation Instructions</span><span class="font3"> booklet should be given this 8-page insert. This may be fastened in the booklet simply by putting a little paste on the back of each fold and inserting the pages in their proper places between pages 46 and 47. When the paste is dry the three edges should be trimmed even with the booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All who w’ere at the Cleveland assembly joyously accepted the new servant to the brethren arrangement and agreed to co-operate to the fullest extent to carry forward this feature of reconstruction and expansion. How anxious all have been to get detailed instructions that they might support this arrangement! Now you have the instructions, which go into effect October 15, 1946; so study them carefully. Each company should consider these amendments at the service meetings during October. This may be done by a company discussion or a talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every company in the United States has been advised as to the circuit in which it is located and the name of the servant to the brethren. Now there awaits but the final routing and notification by the servant to the brethren, and by October 15 each of the 144 circuits will witness a servant to the brethren in action.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But how may you prepare? First, study the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Amendments to Organization Instructions</span><span class="font3"> and learn what will be required of you during the week of his visit. Then plan accordingly. A week of field instruction will be the main assignment of the servant to the brethren, and all publishers, including pioneers, should participate in the group witnessing with him. All features will receive attention as outlined in paragraphs 175, 176.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Attend all meetings held during </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font3"> 4) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font3"> and share daily in the expanding reconstruction work, will strike deep into the hearts of those who truly love God and the “other sheep” and move them to make New World service their life’s vocation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Surely, out of 60,000 or so publishers, many more than those now enrolled can serve as pioneers. Boys and girls just out of school, brethren released from prisons, married couples, housewives, single brothers and sisters, young and old, may find it possible to work full-time, 150 hours a month, in their home territory, or in another assignment. We urge all to give sober thought and serious consideration to their responsibilities before the Lord. Read again pages 20 and 22 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The .Messenger.</span><span class="font3"> Review in the Bible the lives of Paul and other pioneers who served in days gone by, and be convinced that they lacked nothing needful, but led full lives. Prayerfully beseech Jehovah’s direction upon your decision and future course. We shall be glad to send you a pioneer application, and work shoulder to shoulder with you in the expansion of the true worship, now under way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">thousands of Jehovah's witnesses attended the Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly at Cleveland. A contribution of $1.75 is asked for this picture. This large photograph may be ordered as No. 7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">that week: the discourse the first evening of his visit, the service meeting, the Theocratic ministry school, the public talk, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study, and the concluding discourse. Having agreed to this, all publishers will be glad to cooperate with the Instructions in paragraphs 174, 176, 177.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of benefit, where a servant to the brethren is married, will be the definite assignment to his wife. She, in most cases, will have been a special pioneer for a number of years and, having had much practical experience in door-to-door witnessing, will be able to render much assistance in the giving of personal field instructions to publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All pioneers, special and general, will receive attention from the servant to the brethren. In addition to discussing their pioneer work and assignment with them, he will also work with them in the field, giving many of these brethren helpful points that they have so much desired. Paragraph 184 will outline the pioneers’ responsibility in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Without doubt the most eagerly anticipated feature of the multifeatured enlarged work of the servant to the brethren is the provision for the semiannual circuit assemblies, together with the visit of the district servant. These will prove a great stimulus to the work. Study paragraphs 189 to 202 and you will note how the brethren will be able to assemble together in groups and see how their work is progressing. Problems will be overcome at meetings. Towns and cities located in circuits will be given an extensive witness throughout the year. And, too, the assemblies will provide a fine way to get your people of goodwill associated with the brethren, to give them a scope of our work, and get them started in the preaching work.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font2">rapidly since the first announcement was made concerning the Cleveland convention. The remaining time before the convention will pass by even more quickly for Jehovah’s witnesses, because they are busy people. Already the spearhead group has reached Cleveland and is busily engaged in making a thorough coverage of the city to arrange for your rooming accommodations and those of your good-will associates, as well as witnessing to the people of that vicinity. Cleveland's populace is awakening to the fact that the greatest convention ever to be held in that city is at the threshold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Have you made convention preparations in harmony with the information given in the May and June </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informants?</span><span class="font2"> Do all of the people of good-will, the interested persons, in your territory know about this greatest of assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses in modern times? What are they doing about it? Are you helping them to see the benefits they will receive? Have you shown them how easy It will be to make tlieir arrangements to attend?

<p><span class="font2">The organization at Cleveland will be the most complete we can possibly have. Every effort will be put forth to advertise this occasion in all sections of Cleveland and the suburban communities. The publishers will be the main factor in tins, and thousands of territories are being made up now so all can participate in Theocratic service during the convention. You should plan on using the current campaign literature. Bring your book eases and magazine bags. The number of territories for street work will be small in comparison with the number of brethren who will be on hand, so most of the work will be done from house to house.

<p><span class="font2">Reconstruction, in 191!), was the need of the hour. This world, devastated by war, required rebuilding. The true worship, desolated by ene-} my action, demanded restoration. To <sup>;</sup> meet their respective needs, both the representatives of Satan's world and the servants of God moved into action.

Encourage back-call bookstudy attendants to collaborate during July, also. Invite them into the service. Let them listen to you at the door. Have a blank-back testimony card handy, in event they wish to work a few homes alone, and provide booklets for their distribution to friends.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">the privilege of taking up Jehovah's service. Time and again it has been a convention of Jehovah's witnesses that has convinced an uncertain person that Jehovah is with His people. Tell the ones you know of the blessed conventions in past times and do everything you can to make them appreciate the good they will derive through attendance and how glad they will be with His people. Many will go if you co-operate with them and travel with them; they will agree with what you tell them. But surely their expression to you following the convention will be one of amazement and satisfaction : as the queen of Sheba put it. 'the half was not told me.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All lines of transportation—train, bus, automobile, airplane, and lake steamer—will provide a means for Jehovah's witnesses to converge on Cleveland in but a few weeks, and then the convention will be on. Don't miss a day of it. If you haven't sent in your Hoorn Request Form yet. be sure to send it within the next week or ten days. There are thousands of requests already received at the Watchtower Convention offices, 2515 Franklin Boulevard, Cleveland 13, Ohio, and more are coming in daily. It is gratifying to see the numbers who have already signified their intention to be at Cleveland in August. Those who write in for rooms are wise, for they are then assured of having some accommodations during the convention. We hope</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">to have enough accommodations for</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">hall of the I’ublic Auditorium. There all publishers will be able to obtain supplies of literature for the field service. You may bring your own </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">j </span><span class="font2">supplies, if convenient, or plan on ; obtaining literature for field service at the convention bookroom. Current campaign literature, including magazines, will be available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The spacious north annex to the I’ublic Auditorium will provide an area which we hope will be sufficient to operate an efficient cafeteria larger in size than tiny we have ever had. This portion of the convention facilities is located beneath the mall in the civic center and is halfway between the Public Auditorium and the Stadium. It is accessible by underground arcade from the Auditorium and by bridge from the Stadium. Three meals will be served daily to accommodate those of the conventioners who w ish to eat there. Brethren who are familiar with cafeteria work and cooking can be of 'great assistance and are invited to i volunteer their services at the convention. A large staff will be required to feed the thousands expected to eat tit the convention cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Other brethren will be able to hell* with the first-aid rooms which v ill be set up for emergency use. Any doctors and nurses who attend the convention and who wish to serve in this connection should register at the Volunteer Service counter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Undoubtedly there will be many brethren at Cleveland who will never have attended a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses before, because brethren everywhere in the United States and Canada are doing their utmost to have persons with whom they are conducting book studies join in the Cleveland assembly. Many of these new brethren will</span></p>

In obedience to the King’s commands at Isaiah 61: 1, 2 and Matthew 24: 14, they surged forward in the reconstructive work of Kingdom preaching as one collaborative body, determined to make known to the whole inhabited earth the facts about the building up of right worship, and the incoming New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the 26 years gone by since, whose efforts at reconstruction have borne the desired fruitage? The answer is obvious. This world's nations have failed mankind, miserably. Not peace and security, but intensified war, suffering and utter despair for millions have been wrought. Not so with the name-people of Jehovah, however: their work has prospered, gloriously.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Mid-Week Group Witnessing; Quotas</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Week-ends will be occupied in public-meeting work, continuing strong in July. Some territory, as a result, rurals particularly, may not be worked so often. This calls for midweek group witnessing. Beginning the first week in July, the company servant should arrange with captains for group work at least one day each week. As many as possible should unite regularly in this activity, covering either rural or urban territory. The “Fourth of July holiday&quot; affords splendid opportunity to inaugurate mid-week work in your company. All company publishers able should strive for five hours in the field that day. Utilize daylight evenings as well, and arrange to cover business sections, in reconstructive booklet work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The individual quota for company publishers is set at three 4-booklet combinations a week ; pioneers, three 4-booklet combinations a day. No difficulty will be encountered in attaining this quota; the requisite is simply getting into the field, and meeting the public. Offer booklets. in combinations of 10 or 4, in every instance, and through this medium stir right-hearted prospective “strangers” into diligent Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Multitudes, observing the hopeless situation that confronts this world, mourn. Religion, with its devil-inspired doctrines, adds to their grief. They yearn for good news. They want a better world. Squarely upon the shoulders of Jehovah's people does the responsibility rest to educate them In freedom-bringing truth. It means work, a reconstructive work. It means collaboration by all devoted servants in performing it.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It Is Convention Month, Booklet Campaign, and Culmination</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of Service Year 1946</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hemember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.”—</span><span class="font2">Ecclesiastes 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">August, the concluding month of the service year 1946, marks the culmination of a year packed with manifest leadings of the Lord Jehovah, deliverances by the score, and many blessings upon his people. Bans on Kingdom work have been lifted in many nations (to the extent that world-wide only two or three remain now) ; his people have been delivered from the Nazi-Fascist - Hierarchy - operated concentration camps, and the reconstruction of freedom of worship has gone forward at a fast pace, many branches having been opened up in foreign countries and isles of the sea. To climax this, the great convention of all nations has been arranged for at Cleveland, Ohio, and already breth-ren-delegates are pouring in from Europe, South Africa and the faraway isles. These things, meditation on them, his mighty works, stir the mind of his servants and cause them to remember him. As </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> recently put it, ‘‘The best way to remember and not be forgetful hearers is to put the knowledge to work by teaching others.” Thus, Jehovah's witnesses during August will show their ‘remembrance of the great Creator’ by using their faculties to help others to see his many and mighty works, and that in the face of demonic opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Service itinerary for August</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While the nations of the world as a whole have forgotten God and the sentence of Jehovah through the psalmist is, “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God,” yet there are many people of those nations, people of good-will, and these Jehovah’s witnesses are urging to “be glad, ye nations, with his people”. Between the time you receive this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> and the time you leave for Cleveland, you will be making arrangements to assist all of goodwill possible to get to the convention. In addition to convention attendance, August will afford much opportunity for Kingdom service activity in the field. On your way to Cleveland you will take advantage of every opportunity to witness and place combinations with those you meet, as w-ell as a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad,</span><span class="font2"> Ye </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nations”.</span><span class="font2"> Arriving in Cleveland, excellent opportunity will be afforded to ‘remember your Creator’ by coming equipped to engage in every feature of Kingdom activity. This is a service convention, and plenty of provisions for service will be made. Also, you will be on hand for the various lectures and features of the program, absorbing, and taking notes for future use and remembrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Returning from Cleveland, make the round of all back-calls and studies where there are persons who were not able to be on hand, and give them firsthand the information received at the convention and knowledge of the many blessings and joys of fellowship together with brethren from all over the world. In view of the fact that August will be a rather crowded month, traveling to and from the convention, getting organized afterward, calling on the interested, etc., all companies are</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Testimony Period</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">advised that they need not plan on having a public lecture series during this month. Make thorough preparations, however, so that the series may start off in September with a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hang!</span><span class="font2"> All handbills needed for the first two weeks of September should be ordered by July 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer Continues</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The combinations of one coloredcover, one 64-page self-covered, one 32-page self-covered, and one other booklet, on a contribution of 10c; and, secondly, three colored-cover (one being </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad,</span><span class="font2"> Ye </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nations”), </span><span class="font2">three 64-page self-covered, three 32-page self-covered, and one other booklet, making a combination of ten for 25c, will be offered as previously outlined in the June </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> By stressing booklet work, on the way to, at and after the convention, much of the surplus of several million booklets should then be out in the hands of the people, where they will accomplish their purpose. Have you placed your quota of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad,</span><span class="font2"> Ye </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nations&quot; </span><span class="font2">BOOKLETS ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the younger brethren who have ‘remembered their Creator in the days of their youth’ by engaging in summer vacation pioneer service, August affords a fitting climax to their 1946 pioneer activity. Attend the convention and benefit by gaining knowledge that you can put to use during the coming school year, using all your youthful vigor possible in advertising the Kingdom. And all in all, the conclusion affecting old and young, both in years and in knowledge of the truth, is to “fear God, and keep his commandments : for this is the whole duty of man”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 2) </span><span class="font2">probably wish to show their consecration to Jehovah's service by being immersed in water; therefore arrangements are being made to hold a baptism. Those who plan to be immersed should be prepared with bathing suits and towels. This matter should be announced to the companies at meetings during the last week of July as a reminder to the convention delegates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The open Stadium will provide a great spectacle to the people of Cleveland as thousands of Christians assemble there and join in singing praises of their Maker. The nearness of the Stadium to the center of Cleveland may make it possible for the united voices to be heard by many in the downtown area. It is hoped that a large number of brethren who can play musical instruments will be convention delegates. All who wish to join in the orchestral activities at the convention should begin now practicing all the songs in the Society's songbook. All such musicians should bring their instruments to Cleveland. Registration of musicians will be at the Volunteer Service counter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All who attend should come equipped to sing, by bringing their songbooks. Song sheets will not be provided at the convention. Any brethren who are professional or experienced singers and have a desire to participate in the special chorus of singers that will be organized should report to the Volunteer Service counter at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An event of such great importance as this convention should be permanently recorded. The Society hopes to provide a permanent record of the events and will therefore appreciate having those who are experienced in reporting or writing state their qualifications to the brethren at the Volunteer Service counter at the convention. Photography will also play an important part in this. There will be a special need for flashlight photography during the convention. Brethren who have flashlight cameras should bring them to the convention and enter their names on the list of photographers at the Volunteer Service counter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All who plan to bring sound-cars to Cleveland should write to the Convention offices at Cleveland immediately and inform the brethren there concerning the type of equipment and whether it is in good condition. A number of such cars will be used during the convention at special locations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Transportation arrangements are being made throughout the country and many special trains will be made up to accommodate several thousand from the large population centers. Thousands of others will travel on the regularly scheduled trains and busses. These latter ones who do not come on special trains or in special coaches should be sure to list their names and their expected time of departure from Cleveland at the Information counter in the arcade during the convention. It will be to your advantage to register, because this information will be compiled and due notice will be sent to the railroad and bus lines a day or two before the end of the convention so that adequate equipment can be made available to insure a comfortable return journey for conventioners. A special bulletin on transportation is being sent with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> for consideration at your meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One feature of conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses that has always made them most enjoyable and efficient is the willingness of the brethren to co-operate in every way. A certain amount of service must be rendered to the brethren, and there have always been many volunteers. Some will be required for cafeteria work, operating refreshment stands, bookroom work, directing traffic, ushering, musical activities, first-aid service, and maintenance. Brethren who plan to volunteer for cafeteria or maintenance work should bring appropriate clothing for use during the work periods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A number of plumbers, electricians, carpenters and tinsmiths will be required at the convention. Some will be needed a week prior to the opening of the convention. It will be appreciated very much if brethren who are able and willing to do such work will please write the Watchtower Convention at Cleveland (2515 Franklin Blvd., I’.O. Unit 13) immediately and state their qualifications, as well as the date they plan to arrive in Cleveland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Share Gladness with All Nations</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before us there is a golden opportunity to give a great testimony to the honor of Jehovah’s name and at the same time equip ourselves for the big world-wide reconstructive campaign just ahead. As collaborators in reconstructive work, Jehovah's witnesses are today in one body turning their faces toward Cleveland in anticipation of a gracious manifestation of favor by Jehovah to His people. Brethren in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, South America and the islands of the seas are all interested in the August assembly. Many (not all who would like to, by any means, but many) from these outlying places are coming. Some have now arrived in New York; others are already busy at Cleveland. The convention time is near. We are confident of many blessings’ being poured out. Our Commander once said: “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Accept Rooms as Assigned</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the accommodations </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font2">obtained from persons of good-will who are looking forward to having some of Jehovah’s witnesses stay with them. The people are generally very conscientious about putting the rooms in the best possible condition for conventioners. When we have held conventions in Cleveland in the past, a few brethren have not taken the rooms to which they were assigned. That practice has caused the good householders to stay up until late hours waiting for conventioners to arrive. Some bad feelings have resulted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When accommodations are assigned to you, a card is mailed to you showing the date the committee has given the householder for your arrival in Cleveland. Arrange your trip so you ■will arrive that day. If you cannot arrive on schedule or if you take other accommodations, please show consideration for the householder by notifying him. Let us show appreciation for the kindness of the people in opening up their homes to us. Please accept rooms to which you are assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment Needed</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you have any of the type of equipment listed below that is available for use during the convention, please write to Watchtower Convention Committee, 2515 Franklin Blvd., Cleveland 13, Ohio, stating at the same time wdiether you are an experienced sound-equipment operator or technician:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Outdoor speakers, especially the reflex trumpet type with permanent magnet speaker units. High power, good quality amplifiers, principally for use on 110 volts AC. Two conductor speaker wire or cable. Bridging and matching transformers, and pads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Write, but do not ship equipment to Cleveland unless requested to do so.</span></p>

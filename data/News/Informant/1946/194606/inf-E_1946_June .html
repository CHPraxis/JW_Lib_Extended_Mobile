<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>A Blessed Privilege and Obligation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The Scripture constituting the basis for the June activity, Ecele-siates 7:12 (Younf/i, is very enlightening and edifying to the servant of the Lord. “For wisdom is a defence, money is a defence, and the advantage of the knowledge of wisdom is, she reviveth her i&gt;os-sessors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For more than seventy years the Lord has been creating a reservoir of Kingdom knowledge against this very day. Ue has been preparing a people for his name who would be instrumental in the distribution of this knowledge. The only reason for any company of Jehovah’s witnesses existing today is that they may be used in this mighty work of defense and reconstruction. The reviving message contained in the bound books and booklets prepared through the “faithful and wise servant” of the Most High God will never revive anyone while it lies on the shelves or is stored in cartons at the company headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In order to ‘gather out the stones and cast up a highway for the people’, the publications must be taken from the shelves and cartons and placed in the hands of the people of good-will. And the message must then be transferred from the hands of these people to their minds. This all adds up to witnessing, back-calling, and studies with the people. Actually there is no defense through knowledge until the true Kingdom information is established in the minds of the people of good-will. Then only is the possessor revived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">June Campaign Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During June the distribution of the three bound books from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp </span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font1"> and the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”,</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of 50c, and the very essential and widespread distribution of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”</span><span class="font1"> itself, will provide both reviving and nourishing knowledge for the people, and will result to their good and to the glory of God, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font1"> if the publishers follow through by making back-calls and conducting studies with those who receive the message. We can never overlook the fact that the message </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font1"> reach the mind of the person of good-will before it is a real defense to him, and we are responsible before the Lord, not only in the placing of the message in the hands of the people of goodwill, but also in aiding them to get it into their mind. Therefore, be an able minister by following through and make all of your back-calls and conduct your studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many companies are running out of one or more of these bound books, and are ordering direct from the Society, instead of contacting near-by companies and finding out from them what they can do to relieve their needs. Each company servant v ill be responsible for contacting all near-by companies within a radius of approximately 100 miles, and letting them know on what books his company is short or is overstocked. This is so that you can co-operate with other companies and they can co-operate with you in disposing of all this old literature that is scattered among the companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society is able to supply only the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font1"> at the present time, but there are many companies fairly adjacent to you who may have all the literature you require, and be in position to fill your requests for combinations. Therefore, make arrangements to put into operation the above provision immediately. Please make this a local exchange either by exchanging books between one company and another or by giving a regular remittance for literature at company rates to the company from which you are obtaining the literature. It will not be necessary to make out Transfer of Stock and involve the Society in this transaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneers will likewise try to get their literature locally the same as the company. The pioneer will remit the regular pioneer rates to the company from which he receives the literature and then sign with the company servant a joint statement of the literature taken and the company servant will forward it to the Society, who will credit the company with the difference between the company and pioneer rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All Jonadabs and people of goodwill who attend back-calls and book studies should be given an opportunity to complete their sets of any books of which they are short, for there is no assurance that any of these older books will be reprinted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The three-month special campaign for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Jie Glad, Ye Nations”</span><span class="font1"> distribution comes to a close in June. How many have placed their quota? How close to the 10,000,000 mark did we come in these three months? This information will not be available for all the country until a later date. However, each publisher in each company will know by the end of June how close he came to attaining the individual quota set, and the company will know how close to their goal they came. This will be a very interesting matter for discussion in your first service meeting in July. The fact that this special campaign concludes should not retard the distribution of this very essential message. Keep pushing the distribution of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations”</span><span class="font1"> until every home in your territory has had an opportunity to obtain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Have all your officials and prominent citizens been served as directed by Brother Knorr in his letter of February 20, 194G? If not, then this should be done immediately. Every city, town and rural residence must be reached. We cannot miss anyone. Midweek group witnessing in the evenings with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye \afions”</span><span class="font1"> should be inaugurated by</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Write Early for Rooming Accommodations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">As the time draws near for the great all-nations assembly, the hopes of all those who are for Jehovah turn to that marked time in great expectation. Everyone believes that it will be the best yet, and there is every indication to date that the assembly at Cleveland, August 4-11, will surpass all other assemblies in blessings, joy and praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Long ago, in Hezekiah’s time, “much people” assembled at Jerusalem to observe the passover and to praise the God of Israel. According to the Scriptural record, their hearts overflowed with joy as they praised Jehovah day by day, &quot;singing with loud instruments unto Jehovah,” and He poured out wondrous blessings upon them. In modern times, we had a similar great gathering at St. Louis, and ever since the question has been constantly raised, ‘When are we going to have another one like that?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For more than four years the troubled conditions of earth have prevented having such a large assembly, but now in God’s kind favor the joyful prospect lies directly before us. All the pent-up desire for a big convention can now be released in this great event for Jehovah’s witnesses. The word is spreading throughout the world, and from every direction brethren are planning to come: many different nationalities will be merged into the ‘one nation’ whose God alone is Jehovah, bound together in the basic desire for His New World of righteousness. How good it will be for brethren from lands where there are comparatively few witnesses and for the isolated publishers who do not generally have opportunities to talk with large numbers of those of like precious faith to associate with thousands of fellow publishers and rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah '. Truly it is the Lord's provision for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font1"> of his worshipers in these postwar days. The eight days of spiritual feasting will surely build up and sustain God’s people for their continuing fight against spiritual wickedness in high places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Do Now</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> you receive a Room Request Form. Companies are being sent a sufficient quantity to supply each publisher and those of good-will associated with the companies. If more are needed you should write the Brooklyn Office for them. These forms are being sent at this early date so that the brethren will be able to fill them out and send them to WATCHTOWER CONVENTION, 2515 FRANKLIN BLVD., CLEVEIAND 13, OHIO, by June 1 or as soon thereafter as possible. It will be to your advantage to send in your Room Request Form early, because that will help to insure your receiving a definite assignment of accommodations. It will also be a convenience to the brethren now working, on the rooming accommodations in Cleveland. August will soon be here ami we shall have to locate many how many we do not know. There will be very limited hotel accommodations; most of the brethren will stay in private homes. Undoubtedly this arrangement will provide the best means yet of giving a witness to the people of Cleveland. Living in the homes of the people for eight days will open up many opportunities of speaking the Kingdom truth, and all should make it a point to leave a witness in each home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every effort will be made to give you what you ask for, but it may not always be possible to fill your requests with exactness. We feel sure everyone will appreciate the good work being done in Cleveland (especially in these times of housing shortages) to find rooms for the tens of thousands of publishers who have indicated they are preparing to go to the convention. Therefore everyone will gladly accept the accommodations as assigned. By mailing in your Room Request Form early (and we cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">writing early)</span><span class="font1"> you will have a better chance of getting what you prefer. And whatever you do, be sure to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">write </span><span class="font1">for your rooms in advance. Don’t wait and take a chance on picking up accommodations when you reach Cleveland, for there may not be any rooms left. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Write for rooms, and write early.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It has been possible to obtain a location for erecting tents and parking trailers. It is but a few miles from the stadium. You will help the brethren at Cleveland considerably if you send your request for space within the next few weeks. In any event, be sure to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">write</span><span class="font1"> for space </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font1"> you go to Cleveland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Time should be spent at the service meeting following receipt of the Room Request Form to explain its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Train, bus and car groups should now be arranged for, and, as previously advised by the Society, the brethren will co-operate with each other especially in making up groups for trains and special busses. Everyone who loves the Lord is welcome, yes, is urged to attend; so tell all the people of good-will about the benefits they will derive from attending and try to bring some along with you to share in the worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So write for your rooms as soon as possible and make your preparations for the journey to Cleveland. Bring your friends, bring everyone who loves the Lord, and lift up thankful hearts and voices for eight happy days in the true worship of the Most High.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Collaboration in Reconstructive Work </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Field of Activity Earth-wide</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>July Begins Intensive Campaign with Booklets</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">1946 sees the Theocratic Reconstruction work increasing in momentum. Literally hundreds of Watchtower Bible College graduates are now serving in foreign lands, their number steadily increasing, while at the college the seventh class is preparing itself for such service. The president of the Society, Brother N. H. Knorr, has just concluded a tour of organization in which branches were established in Central America, South America, and in the isles of the sea. The truth, the true worship, and the active organization of Jehovah are being reconstructed on every hand. What a contrast with the dark days of 1918-19, when God’s visible organization was disrupted, the true worship all but ceased, and his servants were so sorely tried in faith!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What brought about this striking change in conditions? It was the coming of the Reconstructor Christ Jesus in fulfillment of his commission and the prophecy as recorded at Isaiah 61:1-4. Releasing his followers from their bonds, he revealed to them that there was a great work to be done; and Jehovah God through Christ poured upon them his spirit of joy for the service of reconstruction. ‘Arise from slumber and the dust,’ He called; ‘shake off the ashes, cast off the sackcloth, and get busy in the great work of reconstruction!’ Zion heard and obeyed, and as a result today we see on every hand the fulfillment of our text for the month: “And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.”—Isa. 61: 5, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A.</span><span class="font1"> S. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Far-spread and effective though the activity of Jehovah’s servants has been, such is only the beginning ; there is a tremendous reconstruction work yet to be done, both in this and in other lands. Appreciating this fact each Theocratic worker will seek to have an ever larger share in “Collaboration in Reconstructive Work ”. How can this best be done during the month of July? By bringing to the people the truth as contained in the booklets that have been permitted to accumulate in recent years. There is an important message in each one of them, and it is our obligation to see to it that it reaches someone. Many have received their first understanding of the truth by reading one of these very booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Twelve Million Booklets on Hand!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To aid in placing these booklets with the people, they will be offered on the basis of four on a contribution of 10c or ten on a contribution of 25c. To the extent that the stock on hand permits, each four-booklet combination should contain one colored-cover, one 64-page self-covered, and one 32-page self-covered booklet, and one other booklet; while each ten-booklet combination should contain three colored-cover, three 64-page self-covered, and three 32-page self-covered booklets, and one other booklet. The booklet “Be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Glad, Ye Nations&quot;</span><span class="font1"> should be included in each ten-booklet combination. All of the self-covered booklets, as far as possible, should be at least five years old or even older. Begin with the oldest booklets and work up to the more recent publications. By using the combinations suggested no refunds will be necessary and therefore all publishers will obtain them at the regular rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society has a good supply of the following July and August campaign booklets on hand:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Colored-cover: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People, His Vengeance, Choosing, Warning, Theocracy, Religion Reaps the Whirlwind ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">64-page self-covered: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom?</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">32-page self-covered: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column, Satisfied, God and the State, Comfort All That Mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When ordering please attach to the order a sheet showing of which booklets you already have an over-supply, as It may be necessary for the Society to substitute, and thus we shall not ship a booklet with which you are already overstocked. However, before ordering from Brooklyn first ascertain from companies in your area if they have more than they will be able to place during the campaign, and, if so, arrange to get your supply from them. In many cases this could be taken care of when writing regarding any oversupply or needs of bound books for the June campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Inventories show that there are upward of twelve million of these booklets in the hands of the companies and pioneers. Just think of it, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">twelve million!</span><span class="font1"> Now, by each company publisher’s placing but one combination of ten booklets or three combinations of four booklets a week—and certainly that should not be hard to do—and each full-time publisher placing but one combination of ten or three combinations of four booklets a day, more than six million of these booklets would be placed in the hands of the people during July and August, the extent of this campaign. Let each collaborator in reconstructive work accept this suggestion as his minimum quota, seeking to exceed it to the extent of his ability and opportunities. To this end each company and pioneer should arrange for evening booklet work during July and August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To reconstruct the truth and the true worship in the hearts and lives of men of good-will we must also do a planting and building work by calling back, by answering their questions, by reminding them of the importance of the message, and by working toward a book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During July continue also to stress the public meeting campaign, and let each one zealously and consistently support this feature of the reconstruction work. Placing our quota (and more) of the booklets, calling back on each placement, patiently and tactfully working toward a book study, and diligently supporting the public meetings— that is the way to show appreciation for our privilege of “Collaboration in Reconstructive Work”.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Regarding Handbill Orders</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Companies and pioneer groups throughout the country are sending in many orders for public meeting handbills. We rejoice to be In position to print these for the brethren. However, to facilitate the printing, all should carefully observe the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Be sure to order in even-thousand lots for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">each</span><span class="font1"> talk. Do not send in an order for four lectures with a grand total of 6,000 handbills for the four. To do that means that you are ordering 1,500 for each lecture. The order should be for 1,000 or 2,000 for each lecture, making a grand total of 4,000 or 8,000 for the four. This will greatly facilitate our printing and make possible I better service in supplying you your i handbills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your co-operation in this matter I will be greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(.Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font1"> 2) every company, so that all will have an opportunity to participate in this campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Public meetings are increasing with mounting momentum throughout the country. But there are still many companies that are overlooking this splendid medium of giving a public witness. All who can do so should arrange for as many public meetings as they are able to put on, particularly during June and July. August activities may be light due to the convention, but there is no reason why June and July should not be banner months for public meetings, indoors and outdoors. Many companies are finding midweek-evening public meetings very-successful. People who devote their week-ends to recreational purposes are glad to attend meetings on a midweek evening. Try it out in your community. If you don’t have sufficient qualified speakers of your own, see if some near-by company or pioneer can assist you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: let them praise the name of the Lord.” (Psalm 148:12,13) Scores of integrity-keeping ‘young men, maidens and children' are daily responding to the invitation to praise the exalted name of Jehovah by full-time Kingdom service during vacation. Their letters requesting applications are not childish, but reveal maturity, understanding of the Ixird’s requirements, and an eager desire and firm determination to meet fully their consecration vow. Parents in the Lord will rejoice because of this forward step of their Theocratically-trained children, and will mutually co-operate with them in their endeavors to meet pioneer obligations this summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The vacation pioneer will make his efforts fruitful and care for his responsibilities by engaging to some extent in each feature of service: house to house, back-call, street and store magazine work, and handbill advertising. Be a thorough publisher, enjoy every feature of Kingdom work, and equip yourself for postschool pioneer activity.

<p><span class="font1">Jehovah is sending forth the knowledge of himself, his Kingdom and his purposes in a manner never before paralleled through his organization under the leadership of his anointed King, Christ Jesus. While the Devil is making this earth an arid desert for his subjects, Jehovah is sending forth a refreshing stream of Kingdom truths to those of good-will who have been living in this parched earth, hungering and thirsting for righteousness, feeling after God if imply they might find him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Despite the fact that the old world girds its every agency to save and preserve itself, the Lord has put on the most stupendous </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign of New World information to date, during the four months from January to April, 1946, and a few left-overs cared for in the early- part of May. The grand total of 310,600 subscriptions have been obtained in that period. This alone will mean approximately 7$ million magazines with their life-giving message of the Kingdom going forth to the homes of the more than 300,000 new subscribers during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord is raising up a standard for the people, and it is the privilege of every consecrated servant of the Most High, and of all people of good-will who know of his purposes, to have some part in this, by heralding forth the message of the Kingdom. Let us not stop the upward trend with the conclusion of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign, but keep on pressing the battle to the gate with each successive offer, knowing that the power of our God will give us victory after victory until the enemy is wiped off the face of the earth.</span></p>

Where the pioneer cannot obtain literature from another pioneer, he may receive it from the company at pioneer rates. The company can make record of literature thus placed, and send the list, signed by the pioneer and company servant, to this office at the end of the month. The company account will be properly credited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Older brethren who have contemplated full-time service, but who have hesitated joining the ranks, are afforded a splendid opportunity to find out for themselves whether they can meet the requirements consistently, by enrolling as vacation pioneers. Try it till September 1. We feel sure that many, observing the daily uplifting action of Jehovah’s spirit, will desire to continue thereafter. Upon request, the Society will be glad to enroll such as regular pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many hundreds will realize, during the next few months, the real pleasure and satisfaction that comes with everyday service to the Lord. Will you be one of these? If yes, write in for a Vacation Pioneer application.</span></p>

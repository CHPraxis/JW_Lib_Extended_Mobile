<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>World-wide Campaign Going Splendidly</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Partial Report: 248,977 Books, 3,093,654 Booklets, Put Out in April in 60 Countries</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Nearly 10,000 More Publishers</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Reports Show Greatest Campaign Ever Engaged In</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Day by day, as the reports come in from country after country, the totals mount up. L'p to now we have received reports from 60 countries for the “Companions” Testimony Period and for the entire month of April. In the majority of these countries, except where there is much opposition from Fascist-controlled governments, there has been a splendid increase in publishers, hours, books, booklets, obtainers and sound attendance. In addition, tens of thousands of subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> have been received, although this is something that has never before been attempted. Surely this is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> manifestation of the Lord’s rich blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The reports for April are not complete, but, just to give you an idea of how the campaign is going, we set out herewith a summary of what we have for the “Companions” Period and the entire month of April, also the totals for 84 countries in the “Faithful Warrior” Period, of March 27-April 4, 1937, for comparison. You will note there has been an increase in every department, and the increase will be still greater when all reports are in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Looking at the report for the entire month of April, we see that there have been distributed well over three million booklets. That is nearly one-third of our quota of ten million booklets for the three-month campaign ; and when the final report for April is completed it will probably show better than one-third. We have every reason to believe that our quota of ten million booklets for the entire world will be more than reached by the end of June, with the extra effort that is being put forth this month. Let every publisher push this work to the limit during the few remaining weeks. Remember, the quota for each individual company publisher is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">200 </span><span class="font3">booklets, 20 books, 3 subscriptions. Have you reached your quota?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a later issue of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font3">we hope to give you a detailed report for every country. In the meantime we quote from some of the reports received from different countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">British</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Isles</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The spirit and enthusiasm of the brethren during ‘Companions’ was excellent. The religionists sense that the hour for the spoiling of religion and tradition has come. They have raised a howl of protest and complaint against the distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure.</span><span class="font3"> On the other hand, an unusual amount of new interest has manifested itself in every part of the country. The joy In seeing these new companions taking their stand so quickly and going into the work so energetically has further increased the zeal of the publishers. For the month pioneers averaged 129 hours, auxiliaries 61 hours, and company publishers 16.4 hours. Because of this strenuous effort for April our report has broken every existing record and established a new high mark for books, booklets, publishers, hours, obtainers, sound attendance and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions. Jehovah be praised for granting his people such </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> glorious share in this strange work.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This was the greatest nine-day period and month we have ever had in Canada. Last year the total number of publishers was high. It was 2,947. This year it is 3,975, making 1,028 more than our highest figure last year. The ‘special nine days’ was in every sense of the word a ‘Companions’ Period, and the many hundreds of brethren who joined in the work gave every evidence of participating regularly in the Lord’s service. This evidence of the ‘great multitude’ with us in the Lord’s service thrills us and helps us to more deeply appreciate the fulfillment of prophecy and Jehovah's blessing toward all who take their stand on His side. There is no question that this ‘Companions’ Period has begun not only a season of three months’ intensive activity, but has started for hundreds that which will be to them the greatest blessing in life, viz., coming openly on the Lord’s side and standing for His praise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Central Europe</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Since the beginning of the great campaign the publishers have shown </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> growing enthusiasm, and so we confidently expected this special effort to be a success. Our hopes were not in vain. If the work in the various countries where there are now I great difficulties could have been done without restrictions, results would have been better still. But in spite of this in these countries, viz., Danzig, Hungary, Poland, Rumania and partly also Czechoslovakia, the publishers have made use of their opportunities to the best of their ability. Based upon their former reports, we had expected to have 6,500 publishers in the field; but the reports now show only 4,994 workers. These distributed 14,421 books and 286,606 booklets, and obtained 1,326 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Europe</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Never before have we had so many in the field. Our last record was April 1937, when we had 3,147 out, but now, one year later, we had 3,685, an increase of 538. ‘This is the Lord’s doing, and marvelous in our eyes.’ In Northern Europe there were distributed during the month of April 10,655 books, 359,626 booklets, and 2,603 new subscriptions obtained. This is an increase of more than 50,000 pieces of literature over the preceding year. The brethren in Northern Europe are also pushing the back-call work, making 6,293 back calls in April.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Hawaii</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only 18 publishers in the “Companions” Testimony, but the work they accomplished was tremendous. 318 bound books placed, 743 booklets, and 58 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> obtained. Things are moving in these islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Japan</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This is the highest record ever made.” Ill publishers fought a good fight and in April distributeil 3,818 booklets and 109,236 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> They obtained 466 new subscriptions,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Jamaica</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We find we will require a larger quantity of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> than what we have already received. We are asking for another supply, which we hope will reach us in time for the special period.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Consolation</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Special Offer Ends June 30</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The special three-month campaign with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation on</span><span class="font3"> $1.00 contribution ends June 30. After that date all subscriptions you obtain should be at the full rate of one dollar a year in the United States, $1.25 in other countries, and no free book will be offered to the subscriber. In other words the subscription price for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> in all languages reverts to the regular rate as announced in each of the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We suggest that you continue to talk </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> to all interested people, particularly on back calls. Many thousands more will want </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> and will be pleased to contribute the regular subscription price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a pleasure to report at this time that during the months of April and May there were received at the Brooklyn office 44,594 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> in the English and foreign languages. We expect that the world-wide quota of 160,000 subscriptions will be reached when reports are received from all countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After June 30, continue to take subscriptions wherever possible, using the regular subscription blanks. These should be turned in through the company, and the organization set up for the three-month campaign should continue to carefully check all subscriptions and transmit them to the office in the same manner. All subscriptions taken at the special rate during the campaign should be in the Brooklyn office no later than July 15.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Factory and Office Closed July 30 to August 14</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> of June </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">15</span><span class="font3"> announces: “Notice is hereby given of the closing of the Brooklyn factory and office for the two weeks beginning Saturday, July 30, and concluding Sunday, August 14.” During the above period no literature will be shipped out from the factory nor from the depots in the United States, and no mail will be answered. Every company servant, pioneer and auxiliary should now carefully check his stock and order a supply that will last through all of August. We shall appreciate it very much </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font3">the brethren will refrain from writing the Society during that period of time. The only mail that should be sent in is the report cards for the month of July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Remember “His Ultimatum”, August 6 to 14, and stock up with literature: “Enemies,” “Riches” and other books.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Your Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “Boldness” Period should start off what promises to be by far the most extensive and strenuous witness ever given in any single month. To reach our goal of seven million booklets and 700,000 books by the end of June, it is essential that those in the U. S. who have at all witnessed in the past, also those newly associated with the companies, should make It their first business to witness during June as frequently and as long as possible, taking full advantage of both day and evening witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During April we had 30,733 publishers in the field; in June we should have many more, for not all associated with the companies witnessed during April. At the close of the “Boldness” Period the service committee should check and find out who, of those associated with the company, did not participate in the service thus far in June. These should be promptly contacted and invited to go into the field service with you and report their activity. Particular attention should be given</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">to those who have just recently come to a knowledge of the truth and who need to be properly instructed and encouraged in the service. The Jona-dabs cannot be expected to take the initiative; it is the obligation of the anointed to assist them, as did Jehu, to come and see their zeal for Jehovah. In this the study chairmen have a keen responsibility, as these are not only to conduct the studies and assist the newly interested there, but to supply them with copies of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> and lead them out into the service in territory conveniently arranged in regard to the meeting place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The call is going forth for each one in the Lord’s organization to “rise up against her in battle”. The battle is Jehovah’s; so let us all boldly and gladly respond, and thus give every one in our territory the opportunity of choosing the side of Jehovah or the side of the adversary. Let everyone be a publisher in June! Make your personal quota of 200 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> for the three - month । campaign! You still have to the 30th of June to do it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Lord has provided us with the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font3"> and the time set for its distribution is limited, June 30 being the dead-line. Every means at our command should be used to see that this is done. None of these should be remaining on the shelves of the company stock rooms, but should be in the hands of the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some companies have already exhausted their original consignment and have ordered more. One small company said: “Kindly rush 1000 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklets. Will be completely out by Sunday. First time company has placed allotment before time expired.” Another one, having far exceeded its 15-percent increase in publishers, and consequently depleted its supply, also asked for an immediate shipment of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">We can </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">STILL FILL YOUR ORDERS. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Don’t</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> RUN </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">out now. Work right ur to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LAST MINUTE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The June </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> outlined a plan whereby those running behind on their </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> quotas could overcome this. Study that again. One company immediately responded to the “Evening Work”, and its report is eleven hundred </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> in one evening, to compare with twenty-five hundred during the entire month of April 1 Another company applied the evening work to its business sections, with the result that, on an average, 50 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> per publisher per hour were placed, and these with people that ordinarily would not have received a copy. These people have been pestered for some time by visits from the “black crows”, and their cries for “mercy” are answered in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure. </span><span class="font3">Where these business sections are not held by pioneers, why not set aside an evening a week for this work in such business territory and completely cover it this month? Be brief. Their time is valuable; so is yours. Let them know that you are not a salesman. Tell them you are leaving a copy with them, if they will read it. Contributions are received for almost every </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklet during the evening work. Get </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">CERE</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> OUT DURING JUNE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following is a portion of a letter sent in showing what </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font3">booklets are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Your little book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> was left at my house some time ago by a lady who gave it to my son with the agreement that he read it.

I have always been a firm believer in Jesus Christ and his teachings, but in the different denominations that make up religion I am thoroughly disgusted. ... I absolutely believe what is printed in the little book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> to be absolute fact.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Arrange for Back Calls and Studies in This Territory</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The special campaign with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> in the thickly populated areas of your territory will soon be history. It is a splendid campaign and still going strong, with the Lord’s blessing. Its completion on June 30, however, does not finish the witness work, by any means. In fact, a very big job is before us, that of covering all our rural territory. The wide, open spaces of the rurals will make a very desirable diversion in the matter of territory, and we are confident that all will enjoy it and find it beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore, from July 1 onward all publishers who can possibly do so will turn their attention to the rurals. All - day witnessing parties should be arranged for July 2, 3 and 4, with all available cars in the field doing full duty. These sections have not received the attention that the urban territory has had during the past few years, due to the petition work and special campaigns which were carried on. Therefore our offer in the rural </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">territory</span><span class="font3"> should be one that will embrace all the later books and booklets. The dollar combination can be placed when it is offered with conviction and sincerity. This has been amply demonstrated in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font3">campaign just concluding. Therefore another combination on a dollar contribution is set out for the rural territory for this summer, this combination to be composed of two bound books, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Riches,</span><span class="font3"> with eight colored-cover and six self-covered booklets, on a one-dollar contribution. Wherever the party is found to have books or booklets, others should be shown him. So carry a large assortment in your rural work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Use the phonograph. Open your presentation with the “Enemies” record (I’-114). Follow that up with “Value of Knowledge” (P-101), and conclude with “Riches” (P-102). Three records can be run in the average farmhouse to a real advantage, particularly on Saturday ternoon and Sunday.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To get the best returns for effort and expense put forth working rural territory, the brethren should start early and put in a good day in the service. Rural witnessing is not as hard on the brethren as working in the city. Six or seven hours in the rural territory would not be as exhaustive as three or four in thickly populated city territory. Therefore, take a good supply of literature and your lunch, start early, and put in a good-sized</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">servants and service should plan the work detail, seeing that the covered most economically and effectively with a view to making proper arrangements for back calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are three practical suggestions for making back calls In country territory.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">same day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. Have the that the same same general</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">1. To set aside a period at the conclusion of the day’s work and have each publisher go back to the interested parties with an additional record, and make the back call the territory so assigned publishers go in the vicinity each week, so that they can follow up any interest located each week. Time would also have to be set apart for this work at the conclusion of the day, so that each one would have ample time to call back on the interested, put on additional records and generally help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3. Where there are sufficient back calls to be made, have one or more carloads of publishers dispatched some evening in the middle of the week, leaving off a publisher with his equipment at the home of each interested party, allowing about an hour or so for each back call, and then coming back and picking up each one in the same orderly way, and making a second call (if it is possible) in the same evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of the three suggestions above, the latter two are the most practical because they provide for following up the interest for a considerable time. Whatever plan is adopted it should be known to all the publishers, so that they can plan their work accordingly. Much time, effort and expense can be wasted unless this Is done in a systematic and orderly manner. Therefore the responsibility rests upon the company servant and service committee to see that proper plans are made and proper instruc-</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Seattle Convention</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The assembly of the Lord's people at Seattle, Washington, started off the “Boldness” Testimony Period in America witli a real bang. Although it was a convention the brethren of the drew an amazingly from all parts of the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">primarily for Northwest, it large number United States.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">There were 10,000 out to hear Brother Rutherford's talk Sunday afternoon. Brother Rutherford made a surprise appearance Friday evening, presenting a red-hot resolution on the weak-kneed attitude of the newspapers. This “warning” was then printed and distributed throughout all of Seattle. Again on Saturday afternoon the convention received a rich blessing when Brother Rutherford addressed the brethren. The convention was climaxed by the lecture “Violence”, delivered over a coast-to-coast network and before a visible audience of more than 10,000 persons. The convention was a joy to all who could attend, and the brethren will be eagerly looking forward to their “convention report” which the Society is now preparing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Seattle “Star”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Approximately 13,000 subscriptions were received by the Society for the Seattle </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Star.</span><span class="font3"> The Seattle </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font3"> was afraid to publish the truth, and in the last minute backed out, so those who have subscribed for the Seattle </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font3"> will not receive it. The Society, however, has made another arrangement, so that you will get a complete report of the convention. This will be printed at the Brooklyn factory, and as soon as it is completed copies will be sent to fill the orders for the Seattle </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Star.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Your Report Cards</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Making out your monthly report cards is a little job, but it means so much for these cards to be made out correctly and promptly. The cards should be complete in every detail, including now the additional information at the bottom of the card as to how many back calls were made during the month. When there is nothing to report, the card should be sent in just the same, with the notation as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to why</span><span class="font3"> there is a blank report. Reports of work done during the special periods should always be shown on the report card together with the report for the month, and in no case should a separate report be sent in for the period only. Many companies are very negligent as to sending in their reports promptly, and have to be traced, with the result that the consolidated reports here in the office must be held up awaiting these stragglers. Will you kindly co-operate?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">tions given to the company publishers regarding the arrangement. Where several families can be gotten together to start an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font3">study, suggest number act as that these new ; with copies of other literature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Let everybody, therefore, arrange for the rural work during the next few months, offering two books and 14 booklets, on a dollar contribution. Where the people can not or will not take the dollar combination, drop down to one book and 7 booklets, on 50e contribution, or give them their choice of either </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> or seven booklets, on a 25c contribution. Where the people are unable to contribute for the book or booklets, some one of the later self-covered booklets should be left with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">When “His Ultimatum” Period begins, let everyone use “Enemies” and another bound book, on 50c contribution, In rurals.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This is an announcement which we believe will thrill every one of the Lord's people. It is about a new world-wide campaign which will begin with “Companions'’ Testimony Period, on April !), and continue for three months. It is not just an ordinary campaign, but a campaign that will call for the greatest united effort ever put forth by those who love the Lord. Brother Rutherford has outlined this campaign and has done much preparatory work on it. Let everyone who believes that tire Kingdom is here carefully consider the following, and then prepare to move into action on April 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot;Cure” Booklet</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For this campaign the Lord through Brother Rutherford has provided a special 32-page booklet, entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">CURE.</span><span class="font1"> It is full of fire and will be a most effective weapon of war to use in exposing the enemy. Its front cover is brilliant red, and its appearance and the questions asked will create a desire on the part of everyone who sees it to read it. The questions “Do we need more religion?” and &quot;Is religion the cure for nations and individuals?” will certainly arouse the interest of any thinking person. The Lord's people know the answers, but it is necessary now for millions of people throughout the world also to know these answers. The people are perplexed and in distress, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font1">contains just the message they need. This booklet is to be included in a special offer to be made during the campaign of three months, and this special offer is set out in the one ad which appears in the booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The manuscript for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> reached the Brooklyn factory on December 14. Typesetting began immediately, platemaking was rushed, and by January 1 tin' first press began to turn out this new booklet. During the first two weeks of January the presses turned out over 100,000 daily, and then the production was stepped up to 200.000 daily. This will continue until 10,000.000 copies have been printed and shipped out. The first 530.000 printed will go to Australia and New Zealand. These are on the way and should be there by March 1, 1938. Then will follow shipments to South Africa of 80,000, West Africa 30.000, India 20,000, Philippine Islands 15,000. Hawaii 4,000, England 1,500,000, Jamaica 20,000, and Canada 700,000. For the United States alone more than 7,000,000 copies will be set aside. Because of the special offer made in the advertisement, which offer expires June 30, all these copies must be distributed by that time. Can we do it? We believe we can. by the Lord's grace, if everyone will do his part. Everyone at the Brooklyn factory is working at top speed so that the publishers can have this literature by the beginning of the campaign. From then on it will be up to the publishers to carry out their part in the campaign and get these booklets out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Special Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The offer to be made in this campaign is entirely new. Beginning with the “Companions” Testimony Period, the publishers will offer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, Enemies</span><span class="font1"> (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches)</span><span class="font1"> and a ye ir’s subscription for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All to Work During “His Work”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>30,000 Publishers</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Midwinter and Much Work</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">The clarion call continues to sound loudly throughout the land for the 30,000 and more hearers of the wonderful truths concerning Jehovah and his kingdom all to manifest their faith and allegiance by boldly engaging in the “strange” work now in full swing. Truly the psalmist expresses the attitude of all who understand and appreciate j what the Lord is doing in the earth today when he says: “I will praise -thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.” In order to obtain and to maintain a correct appreciation of one's relationship to the King and his kingdom, it is imperative to give heed to and obey the positive commandment to ‘preach this gospel of the Kingdom’. Satan and all his wicked host are arrayed against mankind. No one is safe from the attacks of these enemies of man except those in the sanctuary of the Lord. The Lord does protect and sustain his own: his people who are willing and active in this day of battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During “His Wojik&quot;, February 5-13, a strenuous effort is going to be made to bring the heartcheering Kingdom message to the people of good will who are still in bondage to Satan’s organization. Throughout the world those who acknowledge Jehovah as supreme will be putting forth their very best on a contribution of only one dollar. It is a remarkable' offer. Just consider for a moment the amount of reading matter a person will receive: a 32-page booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font1"> a 3SJ-page bound book already in its second million edition, and a 32-page magazine 2G times during the year. There is nothing else the people could get with a dollar that Mould anywhere nearly equal this offer in value. The one advertisement on the back of the booklet will help the publishers in presenting this special oiler. If a person cannot contribute a dollar, then the offer will bo </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches}</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of a quarter. People who cannot contribute a quarter but want to know the truth about religion will be given the booklet free or for any contribution they desire. Keep in mind that 10.000,&lt;100 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font1">booklets must be distributed in but three months. That means work, and lots of it; but think of what a witefforts to counteract the increasing organized attacks of the religionists. The Lord has amply provided his willing people with the weapons necessary to tan the old &quot;whore&quot; and her allies. It is especially in times like &quot;His Work”, right in the midst of the most unseasonable part of the year, that the concentrated attacks of Jehovah's witnesses and their associates strike fear in the ranks of the religionists. It's all a strange work to them. Such persistent world-wide boldness and unify on the part of God's people in carrying the Kingdom truths to the people in the face of all kinds of opposition and obstacles is completely beyond their comprehension and power to cope with. The enemy is beginning to realize the devastating power and strength of our God. Joyful indeed is the lot of eieryone who is really on the Lord's side, that is. having the vision of the warfare and doing what he can to further the interests of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Be Prepared<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;।</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For &quot;His Work” the service com- । mittee has selected the territory that can be best worked during severe w eather. Each one should now set aside such definite time as can possibly be spared from secular and household duties so as to work the territory assigned. Determine to let nothing interfere with your plans, trusting in the Lord to provide whatever may be lacking. Any obstacle that you personally feel you cannot surmount, take up with the company servant or the service </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 3) </span><span class="font1">ness will be given! </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklets in 10,000,000 homes will undoubtedly cause many of them to forsake religion. Jehovah's people have a “strange work” to perform, and they are doing it joyfully, and now they will enter into this added privilege of service with greater zeal than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">World-wide Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every one of the people who claim interest in the Kingdom will want a share in the witness work; and therefore a world-wide quota is set as well as an individual quota. The witness to be accomplished is set out in terms of books, booklets and subscriptions as follows : During the three months of April, May and June, by the Lord's grace, we hope to distribute Hi,1X10,000 of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font1">booklet and 1,000,000 of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches)</span><span class="font1"> book and obtain 100,000 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font1"> That will mean that every person connected with the Kingdom will necessarily have to put forth an extraordinary effort; in fact, more than double anything that he or she has done heretofore in the same length of time. With this tremendous amount of work just ahead of us, every company organization, auxiliary, pioneer and special pioneer should now begin making plans and arrangements for this witness, the greatest of all witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Your Personal Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In order to attain this world-wide quota it will be necessary for each company publisher during these three months to place 209 of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklet and 20 of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font1">(or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches)</span><span class="font1"> book and obtain three new subscriptions for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation. </span><span class="font1">Each company publisher should keep in mind that there are three months in which to do this; so, looking at it from a monthly standpoint, it means only 70 booklets, 7 books and 1 subscription per publisher. Can you do it? Will you do it? The quota for auxiliaries is set at 500 booklets, 7a books and 0 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> subscriptions for Ilie three months ; whereas each pioneer and special pioneer should place 1,000 of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklet and 150 of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches)</span><span class="font1"> book and take 15 subscriptions for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font1"> If every publisher of the Kingdom attains this personal quota for the three months, the world-wide quota will be surpassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Cure” and “Consolation” in Foreign Languages</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every<sup>1</sup> branch is already making preparations for tills campaign. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> will be translated into every language in which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> is published. The translating work is proceeding with all possible speed, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h6><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Testimony Period October 2-10, 1937</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">During the last international testimony period, October 2-10, there were, throughout the world, in 67 different countries, 37,634 publishers </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font1">reported. This is a few less than for the corresponding period a year ago, when there were 38,230. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Part </span><span class="font1">of this decrease is due to the fact that a number of brethren fail </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font1">show on their report cards the work done during special testimony periods. In the United States, for Instance, many brethren reported for the month of October but did </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font1">report any work for the testimony period. The total number of hours for this period was 406,222,</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Spanish Convention</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">The convention of the Spanishspeaking brethren will be held at San Antonio, Texas, April 15,16 and 17. It will open the first evening with the celebration of the Memorial, and follow thereafter with matters pertaining to the Kingdom interest. Further details of the convention are set out in the English and the Spanish </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Change of Address</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">It will be a great assistance to the Society, and a saving, if when the brethren move from one place to another they notify the office here of change of address at least one month in advance. If you do not notify the office of change of address for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font1"> the post office will, and this necessitates a payment to the post office for postage on the card on which they notify us. Usually a few days after we have received this notice, then the subscriber sends us a notice of change of address, which, if it had been received three weeks earlier, would have saved the post office extra work in the dispatching of mail and would have saved the Society money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued</span><span class="font1"> from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">page 1, column .}) </span><span class="font1">and, by April 9 or shortly thereafter, we hope to have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> published in the following languages: English, Spanish, Greek, German, Finnish, French, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Bohemian, Hungarian, Polish, Hollandish, and Ukrainian. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> is published in each of these languages, and extra-fine editions of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> are being prepared so that we may have good sample copies to offer to the people prior to and during the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now is the time to consider your territory and see how many of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklet you will require for the various languages; also how many of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> book you will need in these languages. In most Instances the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> book will not be ready in foreign languages, but you will have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklet, which will be off ('red with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font1"> on contribution of the amount usually received for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font1">alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shipments to publishers in the United States will begin about the middle of February. The office will prepare consignments of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font1">booklet, and as you send in orders to this office for regular shipments of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> and other publications we will add to your order your consignment of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure.</span><span class="font1"> If you wish, you can include in your order the quantity you think you will need of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklet, and, if we think it advisable to do so, we will correct it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklets will be charged to companies and auxiliaries at 60c a hundred copies, and to pioneers at to compare with 419,791 a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a few months there will be another world-wide witness. Why not make this one, “Companions” Testimony Period, the very best? It can be done, by the Lord’s grace.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Let’s try to make it 50,000 publishers for the world during &quot;Companions” Testimony Period, April 9-16, 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">20c a hundred copies. The rates on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> will be the same as now, except to company publishers. To these the rate will be only 75c rather than a dollar for a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> subscription. Twenty-five cents of the dollar received for the special offer will be contributed toward the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches)</span><span class="font1"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What to Do Now</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Select your thickly populated territory and reserve it for April, May and June. Check your stock and place your order right after “His Work” testimony period, in February. Get it in early. Do you have plenty of “Enemies” records and other lectures? Are you supplied with phonographs? When you receive your supply of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklets, do not use them until April 9. Prepare now to take care of the details for this onslaught in ‘rising up against her in battle’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Further details in regard to the campaign will be published later. Let every one of the “companions” now pray to Jehovah to direct and bless this united effort, and then get ready to take part in this attack on religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pioneers 110 Hours a Month</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the Kingdom service for the year 1938 opens up, every one who lias taken his stand on the Lord's side, whether of the anointed or of the Jonadabs, will want to use all his faculties to the glory of the Lord’s name, or at least all his available privileges to that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We believe that there are a great many who are not now on the pioneer list who could arrange to lie in that branch of the service. With the thrilling campaign outlined in this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> before us, each and every one will want to do ids part. Let each one, therefore, examine himself and examine his circumstances and see if there are not some apparent hindrances that can be removed, that thus he may be enabled to enter the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Auxiliaries 50 Hours a Month</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If you cannot make the pioneer service, then possibly you can qualify for the auxiliary brand i of the work, which requires only 50 hours a month. Many who are employed, working short hours or part-time, can so arrange their affairs as to take care of this branch of the service without any great difficulty. Those who cannot enter either tlie pioneer or auxiliary branch of tlie work should be company publishers, devoting all the time they possibly can to expanding the Kingdom interests which the Lord has committed into their care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The field can use many more pioneers and auxiliaries. We should very much like to see at least 2,000 regular pioneers in the witness work each month. At the present time there are, on an average, 1,895 pio-</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>“Consolation” Distributors&quot; Copies</span></h5>
<h6><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Companies Should Get Them</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">By “distributors’ copies” of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> we mean that the companies put in a bulk subscription of 5 or more copies to one address. The special rate for “distributors’ subscriptions” is 60c a year. Every company should have 5, 10, or more copies coming to their stock room every other Wednesday, so that when the publishers make back calls they will have the latest issue to show and leave with the interested people. Now, with the new campaign announced in this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> every company should make arrangements for their extra copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation. </span><span class="font1">Send in your subscription now, along with the remittance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is one of the things to get ready for before the “Companions” Testimony Period begins. Do not wait until April, but start now, so the publishers may know they can get them at the stock room regularly.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Ordering Folders</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">Some of the brethren, when ordering folders, are not specific enough; consequently, when the order is received in this office we cannot tell what is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore, when ordering, be sure to specify whether you wish the “Enemies” folder, which is used for general advertising, or the transcription folder, which is put out to advertise specific local meetings. When orders are sent in here they should state specifically either transcription folder (msf) or “Enemies” folder (ensf).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">neers. With short-hour weeks in factories, many more publishers can make the time requirement for the auxiliary ranks. There are 672 auxiliaries in the field now. Can we make it 1,000 by the time the “Companions” Testimony Period begins? Write the society now for the information you want. Do it today if you can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 3) </span><span class="font1">committee. If you do everj tiling you can to discharge your obligation as a witness, be assured the Lord will take care of the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The service committee should check to see that you have sufficient </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> to offer the people, on a contribution of 51 Ic; that all the phonographs and other sound equipment are in working order; that there are sufficient “Enemies” folders stamped for distribution; that back-call appointments for this period are all assigned to tlie publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember to make every effort to get into the homes with the phonograph ; for not only is this method a provision of the Lord which enables you to refresh and warm yourself, but it is the most effective method of witnessing today. Be sure to run “Enemies” record P-114, then to offer the two books. Should they not be able to take two books, then offer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> alone, on a contribution of 25c; or three booklets, on a contribution of 10c. In every home you use the phonograph, try to leave the printed message in some form. If for any reason you run out of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font1"> substitute some other bound book. In other words, be prepared and determined to carry on in the face of any unforeseen emergency.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>May Now Be Ordered Separately if Desired</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">Heretofore the policy of the Society has been not to ship out records except in complete sets where the lectures are in series, namely, “Exposed,” “Religion and Christianity,” “Safety,” and “Worshiping God”. However, to aid the brethren in getting these records, this policy is being changed, and anyone who desires to order one or more records of any series may do so. Many of the brethren probably feel that they cannot afford to get the complete sets at one time, but would like to get a few each month until they have complete sets. Also, many publishers would like to have one or two records of a series to use in regular witnessing. This will help to interest the people to hear the entire series of lectures, and back calls can be arranged for some convenient time. As most companies have one or more complete sets of records, the publishers can borrow these sets from the company stock to take out on such back calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The above applies to foreign records also. Any company or individual who cannot get an entire series at once may get any part of the series desired. We now have the lectures “Exposed” and “Religion and Christianity” in English, Arabic, Italian, Polish, Spanish, and Ukrainian. In each of these languages the even numbers are coupled together and the odd numbers together; for instance, P-61-A with P-63-C, P-62-B with P-64-C, etc. When ordering, please be definite about which records you desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">make “His Work” their starting point. Make arrangements now with the service committee to do what you can during this period, even though your circumstances are such that you can put in only an hour or two in the service. And, of course, the regular publishers, pioneers, auxiliaries, and company workers will do their part during “His Work”, being examples to those who are as yet beginners. Keep in mind the admonition of the apostle, “Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.” As </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> further points out: “The faithful servant must be blind to everything except the service of the King and his kingdom interests. The faithful ones will give unstinted devotion, all their strength and their money and substance, yea, their all of everything, for the advancement of the kingdom interest. Thus faithfully performing their assigned duty, ultimately they will participate in the victory of Christ Jesus and shall behold the power and glory of the Almighty God, whose name alone is Jehovah and whose majesty and glory shall fill the universe and endure for ever.” (W Dec. 15, 1937) So, with each one looking first to the interests of the Kingdom during “His Work”, this occasion is certain to be a joyous one for all who love righteousness. If each one who can at all do so gets out in the field and reports as required, we should have 30,000 publishers in the field. Be strong and fearless; for ‘the battle is God’s’. As soldiers in his army, let us give battle in season and out of season, knowing that he who is for us is far greater than all the forces that may be pitted against us. The joy of the Lord will be your strength and song.</span></p>

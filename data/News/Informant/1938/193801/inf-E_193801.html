<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>February 5-13, 1938</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Enemies</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Riches </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to Be Offered on a</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Contribution of 50c</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Ever since the Columbus convention we have been talking 30,000 publishers. We know there are that many and more that are associated with the various companies throughout the country. Apparently there are some who have been attending meetings for a long time but who do not yet appreciate fully the great privilege and responsibility that rests upon those who know the Lord to engage in the witness work. To show how great is this responsibility, we quote from a recent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“How many today truly appreciate the kingdom of God under Christ? It is manifest that there are those who think themselves the true followers of Christ who do not appreciate the kingdom, because they go on in an indifferent way and show no real faith in God and in his kingdom and no keen desire to serve the same. The fact that they take little or no part in the work that God commands to be done and that must now be done in obedience to his will is proof that their interest in the kingdom is at a very low ebb, if they have any interest therein at all. These who attend the assembly of God’s people hear the message of truth proclaimed and hear emphasized particularly the commandment that the kingdom must now be preached, and then they go their way and ignore the commandment of the Lord and fail or decline to take any part whatsoever in preaching this gospel of the kingdom, and thereby they show that they have no appreciation of the kingdom and will never be permitted to share Its profits, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">unless they are quickly aroused and become truly active.”</span><span class="font2"> (IF Dee. 15, 1937)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We hope that those who have been negligent or indifferent to their kingdom interests will now fully awake to their responsibility. To have a part in proclaiming the message of the Kingdom is the greatest privilege that men have ever had. Everything else pales into insignificance when compared to it. “No one can now obey God’s commandment by substituting some other person for himself. It is an individual responsibility. It is an opportunity for each one to prove his devotion to Jehovah. It is now war time and the witnesses of the Lord must now be engaged in that war, and their part therein is singing the praises of Jehovah and his King; and that song of praise sung in full confidence to the Lord strikes terror to the heart of the enemy.” (TV Dec. 1, 1937)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let each company consider this matter in their service meetings between now and this next testimony period. If there are some in your company that have not been engaging in the witness work, perhaps you can help them to see their responsibility. If they have some difficulties which have prevented their putting in time in the field, maybe you can help them to overcome them. It is our privilege to stand together in this war, not to attempt to drive anyone into the Lord's service, but to assist one another in every way possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The next thing to consider is time in the field. This testimony period comes in the middle of w’inter, and we can expect severe weather. However. we can’t stop this witness work every time a cold day or stormy weather comes; we must meet these difficulties like good soldiers. The thing to do now is to look around for some section of your territory that can be more easily worked in severe weather. In the larger cities there are many apartments, which can well be worked at this time of the year. But if there are no apartments in your territory, don’t give up. Clothe yourself as warmly as you can, and remember the phonograph. It will help you to get inside of the homes of the people, where it is warm. We hope that each company publisher will strive to put in at least 10 hours during this period, and more if possible. However, those who can put in only an hour or two should not be discouraged from taking part, but should do that much anyway, so that we can have as many publishers as possible during &quot;His Work” testimony period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During “His Work” period we will offer </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> to the people, on a contribution of 50c. Try to get in with the phonograph at every place possible. Run the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> record, B-ll-1, then offer the two books. If a person cannot take two books, then offer </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> alone, on a contribution of 25c; or three booklets, on a contribution of 10c. If a person has </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font2"> then any other one of Brother Rutherford’s books may be offered. A testimony card for the two-book combination will not be provided. We believe the publishers can now more effectively present the literature by means of the phonograph, or if unable to get in with the phonograph, by briefly telling the people in your own words why they should get these books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Back Calls. Don’t forget to follow up interest that you find in witnessing. When you meet an interested party, fill out one of the Back Call slips, making a definite appointment as to time to call back. Publishers should make their own back calls if possible. Do not try to shift the responsibility on to someone else, because in all probability your fellow publisher lias all he can do to look after his own interested ones, without taking on yours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The name chosen for this testimony period, “His Work,” is very appropriate. As stated in Brother Rutherford’s letter which appears on the 1938 Calendar, “Jehovah has risen up and is now doing ‘his strange work’, and it Is our privilege and duty to participate therein.” For some time now we have been studying the serial article “His Work and Ills Act” in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> There it shows that the remnant and the Jonadabs have a definite commission to perform which was pictured by the commission given to Jeremiah. That work which Jeremiah did was “strange” to the religionists of his day. Likewise at the present time, the preaching of this gospel of the Kingdom and the exposing of the lies taught by the old “whore” seem very strange to those who are practicing religion. Jeremiah did not try to side-step his responsibility; neither can those who now expect to receive God’s approval shirk the duty of proclaiming this gospel of the Kingdom. As the witness work progresses, the anger and hatred of the enemy increases; but we will press boldly on, keeping in mind the year text, ‘Be not afraid: the battle is God’s.’</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Spanish Convention Date Changed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The Society is arranging for a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses particularly for the Spanish-speaking brethren, to be held at San Antonio, Texas, April 15-17 inclusive. All Spanish-speaking brethren who can reasonably attend should make it a point to do so. The local company at San Antonio will have charge of the arrangements of the convention, under the direction of the Society. Brothers Montero and Keller will attend the convention. Brethren desiring to attend this convention may communicate with J. D. Carter, 517 Stonewall St., San Antonio, Texas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">English company servants should notify all the Spanish brethren in their companies relative to this convention. Correct date is April 15-17.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Our January Service</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Since December 12 we have been offering </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and seven booklets (four colored-cover and three selfcovered), on a 50c contribution. This same combination will be continued throughout January and during the first four days of February. Have a good selection of coloredcover booklets with you in the field, taking advantage of this period to reduce your surplus stock. As many of the companies have on hand quite a number of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font2"> booklet, let this be one of the self-covered booklets in your combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Use your phonograph extensively during this period and let Brother Rutherford introduce the literature for you. The new record </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Enemies, </span><span class="font2">r-114) and the one introducing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font2"> (“Value of Knowledge,” P-101) may be used with profit.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Filthiness of Flesh</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In view of correspondence coming into this office, the following excerpts are published, as taken from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> March 1, 1935, pages 76-80, and it is suggested that that entire article appearing in said </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> be taken up and discussed sincerely at a service meeting of all companies:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Is the use of tobacco, then, clean or filthy within the meaning of the Scriptures? The use of tobacco is exceedingly filthy, regardless of the form in which it is used. It befouls the body and dulls the mental faculties. It makes the user offensive to those with whom he comes in contact, and works great injury to the user and is a dishonor to God and Christ. The use of tobacco has greatly demoralized the human race. It creates an appetite for other impure and filthy things. The poison thereof calls for other poisonous things, creating an appetite for such. Under no condition is the use of tobacco approved by God’s Word. It is entirely inconsistent for anyone of God’s temple company to use the filthy weed, and for that reason no one using tobacco is permitted to remain at the Bethel home. For the same reason it is Inconsistent for anyone who represents the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society to use tobacco either to chew or to smoke. Pioneers and auxiliaries, and others, are the direct representatives of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. To be sure, the Society has no power or authority to say that a person who desires to use tobacco cannot do so, but the Society can properly say it will not co-operate with those who do insist upon using tobacco, and therefore will not willingly make such persons the representatives of the Society. Those persons, therefore, who conclude that they must use tobacco, and who prefer to do so rather than to participate in the Lord's work under the direction of the Society, are at full liberty to choose which course they wish to take. Those who conclude that they must use tobacco, and who are now representatives of the Society, may so notify the Service Department at Brooklyn, and their names will be withdrawn from the list. If to such persons the use of tobacco is more important than serving God’s kingdom as one of his witnesses, then let such persons go ahead and satisfy their selfish appetites, but do not expect the Society to authorize such a person to represent it in the proclamation of the kingdom message. We are in a time of greatest importance, when every one of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on payc 2, column</span><span class="font2"> 4)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Those who have placed their orders for Year Books and Calendars will receive them before the first of the year. All orders placed for Year Books and Calendars should be accompanied with a remittance.

<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Back Calls and Setups More Publishers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s provision for the people now includes, as one of its most important features, the sound equipment. The effect of the continual and persistent use of the sound equipment is manifesting itself In a great many companies by a decided increase in number of publishers. Where this has been permitted to slacken and is used Indifferently, the same progress is not in evidence. The following table shows a few of many companies that are consistently using the sound equipment, and their increase in publishers during the past three years. The figures shown are the average number of publishers for October and November of 1935, 193G, and 1937.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1935 1936 1937</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark17"><span class="font2">Oakland, Calif. 88 130 141 Miami, Fla. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 &nbsp;&nbsp;39</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark18"><span class="font2">Wichita, Kans. 49 &nbsp;&nbsp;74</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark19"><span class="font2">Detroit, Mich. 190 244 264 Harlem, N.Y. (Col’d) 107 130 156 Dayton, Ohio &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74 &nbsp;98</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark20"><span class="font2">Tulsa, Okla. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57 &nbsp;&nbsp;80</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">You will note that the sum total of these figures shows that in two years there has been an Increase of over 40 percent in number of actual publishers. These figures do not represent attendants at meetings, but those who actually go from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In some companies the brethren do not yet appreciate the importance of using the sound machine. The phonograph should be definitely a part of every publisher's equipment, and every publisher who is physically able to handle a machine should be using it regularly. Those who are physically unable to handle a machine can go from door to door and, as for their sound work, can get assistance. In every company there are some young Jonadabs and others who will be very glad to assist and co-operate with the more feeble ones by helping them carry the phonograph and supply of books if necessary. Publishers who are physically able to use the phonograph and are not doing so are to that extent withholding from the strangers, the people of good will, the provisions that the Lord has made for them; and no one can do this and hope to have the Lord’s approval at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Back calls are a very important part of the Kingdom service now. Every publisher should try to arrange his time so that he can devote at least one evening a week, and if possible two evenings a week, to making back calls. It is on back calls that we have a real opportunity to aid the people of good will. When doing this work, we should keep in mind that our purpose is not to make social visits, but to present the Kingdom message. If the people do not show any interest when the records are run or when discussing the truth, but want to change the conversation to other matters, then the best thing to do is to conclude the call and look for others who are more interested. Those who are ‘sighing and crying for the abominations that are practiced in the land’ will be eager to spend all the time possible In learning more about Jehovah’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It Is not practical to set out a definite procedure to be followed on every back call, because each one is different, and the publisher must use his discretion and the spirit of the Lord in handling it. Many of the brethren have found that the use of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font2"> booklet Is a great help, and the Society recommends its use wherever possible. The sooner the people get in the habit of following the outline set out in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study,</span><span class="font2"> the more progress they will make. However, If the people bring up other questions aside from the subject matter being discussed, it is well to answer these questions briefly and Scrip-turally and then go back to the questions in the study. Some people grasp the truth readily and after two or three calls show up at the regular meetings of the company, but with others it requires time and patience. It is better to spend an hour or an hour and a half once a week with a party who shows genuine interest than it is to make a lot of brief calls on people who make no progress. Keep in mind that the purpose of our back-call work is to aid the people in getting an understanding of God’s purpose, that they may take their stand on his side, and, if they do, that they must become publishers sooner or later. If after a few calls you find that the people are not making any progress, the calls should be discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">More Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another feature that deserves the careful and prayerful consideration of all the Lord’s people is the number of publishers participating in the service work. The tendency on the part of many has been to drop off field activity almost entirely during the winter months. In the majority of cases these same brethren conduct their other business during the winter as well as during the summer. They have obstacles to contend with, of course; but if they can overcome these obstacles to conduct other business, it should be possible also to overcome them in order to conduct the most important business on earth, the Lord’s kingdom interests. Let each one, then, look carefully to his Kingdom interests and look to the Lord for wisdom and strength to meet the increasing difficulties of the winter and go ahead in the Kingdom service. Let our slogan be: “30,000 publishers in the field.” If each one individually looks to his own part In this, this can very easily be attained; for there are considerably more than 30,000 different individuals who participate in the service each year. Let each one budget his time: set aside a certain portion of time for the Kingdom service, and do not permit anything to Interfere with that arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">More publishers are in the field this year than last year, but not the 30,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Start It Toward 30,000 Publishers 1936 Publishers 1937 Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">October &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23,761 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25,511</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">November &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22,139 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22,634</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">December &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21,166 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">January &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17,162 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is not a matter of keeping better than last year. It is a matter of each individual’s being a publisher and hitting that 30,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Watchtower” and “Consolation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Other very important provisions that Jehovah has made for the people at the present time are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font2"> These should be consistently made available for every person of good will. Sometimes the publisher, when he places a book or combination of</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Order 100 Pounds, Please</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Fill Out</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Order Blanks Carefully</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Company servants and pioneers should keep in mind that the Society must pay for 100 pounds of freight whether you order it or not. Of late the Society lias been paying freight on many shipments of 40 or 50 pounds, and these shipments could just as well have been 100 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Stockkeepers in large companies should check their inventories carefully at least once a month and then place an order for not less than 100 pounds of books and booklets. Company servants should check and see that the stockkeeper does this. Before okaying an order to send in, see that it is for 100 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the brethren have been very careless in filling out their order blanks. Orders come in without the full address, or the order is very indefinite. When you wish literature in foreign languages, please state the language. If you want someone else notified of the shipment, please state it plainly in the proper place. Please note on your order blank whether you are a pioneer, auxiliary or company publisher. A little care on the part of the company servants in sending these orders and checking them carefully will speed up the work In the office considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Place your orders now for February. Many brethren wait until just two weeks before a campaign to stock up. Companies should know pretty well by now how much literature Is normally placed during a campaign period. Therefore there seems to be no reason why the brethren cannot place their orders now, early in January, for the February campaign. Prior to the last two campaigns, October and December, we were filling orders up to the last minute, and undoubtedly many of these shipments did not get to the brethren in time for the campaign. Get your orders in early, please.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">books or booklets, overlooks to mention these two very important publications. This should not be; and in order to be continually reminded of the fact that you have them, you should carry them in your case each time you go out In the service. Tell the people about them. Show them the need of having these publications coming to their homes every two weeks. Pioneers are supplied with additional copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> free, for their use in the field service. The majority of these brethren are using them effectively and to a great advantage. There are some few, however, who do not do this. Instead of judiciously distributing them and using them to take subscriptions, they lay them aside and let them accumulate. Many of them are not properly used. This should not be. Not only is this negligence in not using the Lord’s provisions, but it is also a waste of the provisions that the Lord has made. If, for any reason, pioneers are unable to distribute and use effectively the sample copies they are now getting, they should advise the Society to that effect and their supply for these will be discontinued or reduced to that which they can use effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Setups</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The phonograph work is expanding and it is giving a tremendous witness throughout the country and throughout the world. However, some of the brethren are so anxious to get phonograph setups that a few of them are carrying this work to an unreasonable extreme and in some cases making themselves al-</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continucd from page 1, column</span><span class="font2"> 4) Lord's people must be on the alert. Those who want to represent the Lord and his kingdom must be clear of mind and hence avoid all things that Satan can use to interfere with their service. ... 2 Corinthians 7:1,...</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Evil is that which works injury. No person is justified in working injury to himself, and certainly it is wrong to work injury to another. The use of such a poisonous weed as tobacco works injury both to the user and to those who are in contact with the user. This is particularly true with regard to smoking tobacco. . . . There is every reason against the use of tobacco; there is not one reason that supports its use. Surely, then, no Christian who is serving God could have an honest and sincere desire at any time to use the filthy weed. By doing so he is working injury, hence doing evil, and is following ‘the evil way’. These things God declares that he hates. The fact that Jehovah hates that which works evil, coupled with the fact that tobacco does work evil, is conclusive proof that tobacco is the Devil’s weed employed for the purpose of demoralizing human creatures. . . . The contaminating influence thereof has spread to all parts of the earth. Imagine Eve in the garden of Eden with a cigarette in her lips.”—Pages 77, 78.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">most ridiculous. This work should also be conducted with the proper dignity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A setup is where one or more persons listen to a sound recording where they can give attention to what is being said and ask any questions they may have. When one sets up his sound machine in a hallway and puts on the recording as soon as the door is opened whether the people want to hear it or not, this is not presenting the message in a reasonable and effective manner. In many cases the door Is slammed shut and the people consider the witness as some kind of nut or a fanatic. The other people on that particular floor of the apartment house will not even answer at the door; so, instead of contributing to the witness, such arrangements have the opposite effect. There may be occasions when it is necessary to put on the witness in the hall. For illustration: If a lady is in the apartment and she is fearful of letting in strangers but is willing to listen at the door, and she agrees to listen, it may be advisable to put on a record in the hallway. Let each one use the spirit of a sound mind, and not do foolish things simply to get a high percentage of setups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another example of an ineffective phonograph setup is tills: A publisher rings a bell for upstairs, and the party puts his head out of the window one or two flights up and inquires what the publisher wants. Then the publisher says that he has a message of importance and asks that the party listen to It, and starts the phonograph on the porch or holds it on his arm. The distance is too great for the party on the second floor to hear, and the disconcerting noises in the street interrupt it. This could not be considered a practical or effective witness with the phonograph. The neighbors looking on from across the street and next door will be inclined to think you are more or less of a fanatic, and refuse to answer the door when you call. The important thing is to have the people hear and understand the message. In order to do this we must meet them at the door, talk to them on their front porch, or in their back yard, or in their home. To appreciate a short lecture the people must be able to hear all of it.</span></p>

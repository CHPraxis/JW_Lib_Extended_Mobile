<p><span class="font3">We have come to the time that all the Lord's people have been looking forward to and preparing for during the past three months or more: to the beginning of the greatest world-wide campaign ever carried on by the Lord's visible army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2111 the details have been taken care of, either in former </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informants </span><span class="font3">or in another part of this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font3">Everyone, by now, should know what he is going to do, how to do it, when he is going to enter the campaign, and to what extent he is going to participate in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The campaign commences Saturday, April 9, the first day of &quot;Companions” testimony period. This will be a red-letter day for all those who are on the Lord's side, the anointed and their companions. The campaign should start with enthusiasm and zeal. The first week has a number of “holy” religious days in it—Palm Sunday, Rood Friday, and Easter Sunday. This is one season of the year when the Hierarchy crowd think they reign supreme and all they have to do is to sit back and gather in the shekels from their poor deluded supporters. Many persons will be sighing and crying because of the abominable conditions that exist in the religious organizations controlled by the old “harlot”. It is a fine time to begin distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> and get a real wallop at the religious racketeers before they get over their drunken stupor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For practically till of us the Saturdays and Sundays, April 9,10,16 and 17, as well as Friday the 15th, | will be the days on which we will devote most of our time to the field service. With five full days for most of us, and witnessing parties arranged for every day for those who can get out, along with the many back calls to be made, we shall get off to a wonderful start. Company publishers should easily get in 10 hours or more, and the pioneers and auxiliaries will be able to do much more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A number of the brethren who are schoolteachers or pupils in school will have an opportunity to put in still more time, because of the Easter holidays which go into effect in most sections of the country. Those who really love the Lord will demonstrate how these holidays can be used to the glory of His name by taking advantage of the occasion to enter the field service. There is no doubt in our minds that 30,000 warriors in the United States will be fighting shoulder to shoulder during our most</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">January 31, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">To the witnesses of Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Dear Brethren and Companions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A world-wide witness campaign to the name and glory of Jehovah and his King begins April 9, 1938. That campaign specially features the message of testimony of the Lord set forth in the books “Riches” and “Enemies” and the booklet “Cure”. Such contains a warning from the Lord’s Word to “Christendom” and a message of hope to those who are looking for consolation. The obligation to get this message to the people is laid upon everyone who has covenanted to do the will of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">It appears from the Scriptures that the people of God are now entering upon a period of unusual importance, during which time every one of the anointed and companions must do his, or her, duty. It is my privilege and duty to call your attention to the importance of the hour and to the message of the Lord that must now be delivered to the people. All witnesses must now be at complete unity in action, dwell in peace, and work harmoniously in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Will you put forth your best endeavors to carry this testimony to those who have a hearing ear and to give warning to others?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Never in times past has there been such an opportunity to sing forth the praises of Jehovah and speak of his glorious name as now. He has commanded all who are of his organization to rise up against the enemy in war, and our part in that warfare is to bear testimony to his name and sing the praises of Jehovah and his King. Be of good courage and do your part, and may the God of peace and righteousness shield and protect you and richly bless you as you go forth. To you the Most High speaks as at Isaiah 51: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The interest of the Kingdom is of paramount importance and is the only thing worth while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">With much love and best wishes,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Yours for the Kingdom Interest,</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In February 24,856 workers were in the field; the best February yet. Needed 5,200 more publishers to put us over the 30,000 mark. By the Lord’s grace it will be done.</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">tremendous campaign. We are looking forward with keen interest to the results of the “Companions” period. and, of course, to the results of the entire month. Let each one, therefore, carefully check each and every feature of the work and see if he has made the necessary preparations and is ready to “shoot” when the day arrives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Has each and every one of you</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">studied the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informants</span><span class="font3"> thoroughly, so that you are acquainted with all the details of the campaign?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Ready?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you checked on your equipment? Have you seen to it that you have the proper records, that your phonograph is in good working order ; that you have a good supply of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, Enemies,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> for</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Turn In Reports Daily</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has set the quota of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font3">subscriptions it expects each publisher will reach by the end of the campaign, June 30. On this basis the company is to set its quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the very outset, the service committee should vividly keep the publishers informed from week to week of the progress they are making toward meeting the company quota. Only in this way can prompt steps be taken to overcome any emergency that may arise because of falling behind in any phase of the quota. A splendid way of portraying this is by means of a “thermometer chart”, as illustrated in the Outline. This instrument should measure the “heat of ihe day”, and Is a good means to check on the distribution of the “hottest” message yet, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font3"> The Lord says, ‘I would that you were “cold” or “hot”.’ The lukewarm He spues out of His mouth. A member of the company should be selected to keep this chart up to date, so that the publishers at each service and Sunday </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> meeting may know what has been accomplished and what they have yet to do. Also, each publisher should personally see to it that the &quot;My Quota” chart is accurately kept, so that each one can put forth the required effort to aid the company meet its quota and really help in making the world-wide quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Accurate Dally Reports Required</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each time a publisher engages in the witness work, the publisher should make out a Daily Report slip and promptly turn in this report to the company servant or drop it in the report box. Turn these in at every meeting or as soon as you can. Your full co-operation is necessary in this, so that the service committee can keep abreast with the quota set. This is the time to turn on all the “heat” and make it hot for the old “whore”. The world-wide witness of her coming destruction at the hands of Jehovah’s Executioner will make her squirm and howl. The more intense the heat (zeal for Jehovah), the higher will go the “thermometer”. Let each one co-operate in every feature of the campaign, putting his heart and soul in the joyful task now set before him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">those who already have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, </span><span class="font3">and a good supply of Distributors' copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> subscription blanks? See that you have your testimony card all prepared for such emergencies as may arise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Obtain </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Subscriptions </span><span class="font3">Before you can intelligently present anything to the people you must be acquainted with the article. The reason why the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font3">is going so well is that the brethren have read and studied it. The reason why </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> will go well is that you will have studied it. You should be acquainted with reasons why people should read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> Some of these reasons are (1) that Brother Rutherford is a regular contributor to the magazine, and his answers to various questions can be found on page 17 of every issue; (2) commerce and politics do not control the magazine; (3) it publishes facts and truths that are not found in the newspapers and other magazines. Other suggestions you will be able to find in the regular advertisements of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font3"> which each publisher should read. These points should be presented to the people who show interest. We must appreciate the value of a magazine before we can show its value to someone else. Therefore all the brethren should be subscribers. Send in your subscriptions now. After you have read your copy, then use it as a sample copy in obtaining other subscriptions in the world-wide campaign with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklet.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Company Publishers, Please Take Notice</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">The correspondence received shows that many small orders for literature are sent in by company publishers. It will be easier and of less expense to the Society, and a saving to yourself, if you get all your literature from the stockkeeper rather than use the coupons in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consola</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tion</span><span class="font3"> or, for example, the special coupon that was in the recent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">formant</span><span class="font3"> regarding the world - wide campaign with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies. </span><span class="font3">The Society has always stressed “100-pound orders” because this is cheaper; and if the brethren associated with companies will please get all their literature from the company stock we can send more 100-pound orders to the company. We shall appreciate it if all company publishers and all associated with company organizations will please co-operate to this extent. It tends to better organization in the company and will relieve the oilice here of much extra work that is really unnecessary. Get all your supplies through your local company organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font3"> 4) Have you your territory? Do you know where you are going to work, with whom you are going to work, and when?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you studied your </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklet, so that you are acquainted with its contents and can intelligently tell the people the message it contains?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Have you advised the company servant and service committee of the part you are going to have in the campaign, when you are going to be on the job, in what car you are going, or who is going with you in your car, so that all the necessary preparations may be made? Do you have a territory assignment near your home, so that you can get out for an hour or two in the middle of the week also?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The company servant and service committee should thoroughly cheek up also on the territory, see that it is properly prepared and assigned, that all equipment is in condition to “shoot”, that sufficient literature is at hand — </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, Enemies,</span><span class="font3"> Distributors’ copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font3"> records, etc., and that the names of the people of good will are thoroughly checked over and that they are being assigned so that those persons</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Sending In Your 100,000 Subscriptions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Do It</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to handle this tremendous increase in subscriptions, the office at Brooklyn will need all your co-operation. With this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font3">there is being sent to every company, pioneer and auxiliary a special form to use in transmitting subscriptions to the office. Please follow the suggestions set out herein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Check each subscription slip turned in, for complete address. If not written plainly, make it clear, so It can be read here without any trouble. Be sure the street, avenue or route number is shown. If these are not tilled out completely, immediately have the publisher who took the subscription and signed the slip give you the correct information. If subscription is obtained through the special offer, the company servant will receive 75c to remit to the Society. The other 25c of contribution is to take care of the cost of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The company servant should select a capable brother or sister to check all slips and to till in all the j</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Spanish Testimony Card</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">A testimony card in Spanish has been prepared introducing the special offer of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, It idles</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> (all in Spanish), on a contribution of 75e. Spanish </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font3">is published only’ once a month, hence a year's subscription is only 75c, and during the special campaign </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> will be offered with a year's subscription on contribution of 75c. If you need some of these cards for your territory, please order them.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>New Model Phonograph</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is pleased to announce a new model of the small portable phonograph. The new model is very similar in every respect to the small model previously manufactured, except that it is 11/16 of an inch deeper than the older model, which permits the tone arm and reproducer to be left in the playing position when no more than three discs are being carried in the machine. There is a small coil spring in the lid of the case to hold the records on the turntable when carrying the machine. The removable tone arm feature is retained so that on making back calls the tone arm and reproducer can be placed in the bottom of the case as before, thus leaving room for carrying up to 10 or 11 discs in the phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is nearly 2500 machines behind in tilling orders, but we hope to be able to 1111 all of these orders in the next three months. All of these orders will be filled with the new model which we are now producing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">will be given attention during this campaign and given an opportunity to obtain the special combination themselves and introduce it to their friends, relatives and neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you have a proper indicator, so that the progress of the work may be ascertained, as Illustrated in the “thermometer” appearing in the outline accompanying this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Are the necessary brethren appointed to look after the subscriptions, to see that they are properly-recorded and contributions for same received and forwarded to the Society ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These and all other preparations necessary for a successful campaign should be carefully cheeked now. that the work may go forward smoothly, enthusiastically and effectively to the glory of the Lord, it will not be difficult or burdensome names and addresses on the “transmittal form”. Keep a carbon copy for your own records. Number the forms consecutively and send in a remittance to cover the subscriptions listed at 75e each, and those at $1 you may list as &quot;renewals’'. When mailing, have money’ order to cover, special form with all the names and addresses listed, subscription blanks to correspond with the &quot;transmittal form”, all enclosed in one envelope. These should be mailed in at least once a week, and oitener if you get more than a sheet full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We cannot overstate the care that should be exercised in handling these subscriptions, not only on the part of each publisher in turning them over promptly to the company servant, but also on the part of the person who gathers the subscriptions and sends them in to the Society. The more care that is taken all the way through, the better the handling here in the office will be, and the fewer the complaints we shall receive. We know you will co-operate.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Convention</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">A convention of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions will be held at San Antonio, Texas, April 15-17 inclusive. Both the Spanish- and English-speaking people of the Lord will be served at that convention. The convention will open at the meeting place, 323 Matamoros Street, at 8: 30 a.m. on Friday the 15th. All brethren should bring their phonographs, with the necessary records. Those desiring accommodations will please address J. D. Carter, 517 Stonewall St., San Antonio, Texas. A joint meeting of English and Spanish will be held on the evening of the 15th to celebrate the Memorial.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>“My Quota”</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>For World-wide Campaign</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> are sufficient special forms for each publisher. Every one of the witnesses for the Kingdom will want to know whether he is keeping up with his own personal quota ; therefore the Society is supplying this week-by-week report. As you turn in to the company servant your worker's Daily Report of your field activity you should make notation from it on “My Quota” record. In this way you can keep tab on the number of books, booklets and subscriptions you have obtained and see whether you have readied your personal quota and how much over your personal quota you accomplish in the three months. If all of those who are actively engaged in the Kingdom work maintain their personal quota, then the world - wide quota of ten million booklets, one million bound books and one hundred thousand new subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> will easily be attained. We hope that your totals for the campaign will be more than your personal quota. More than 43,000 of the “My Quota” sheets are being sent to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> readers. If every one of you will use it and report your activity to the company’ servant we shall more than reach the 30,000 quota of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">to any if each one does his part, but if one lies down and refuses or neglects to do his part, then the burden will fall on somebody else. Let no one be a burden to his brethren, who themselves have nil they can do, but let each one cheerfully co-operate in making this campaign a success.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>What to Do When</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>You Take a Subscription</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">Each publisher, when obtaining subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font3"> should leave with the individual a current copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> Also leave with the party the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> book, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font3">booklet and a carbon copy of the subscription slip, which is his receipt. Sign this receipt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The original slip, together with the remittance of 75c. you will turn in at the very first opportunity during the week to the company’ servant or the one designated to receive subscriptions and transmit them to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You will also make out a Back Call slip. Hold this Back Call slip yourself, so as to make a back call within a week or two with phonograph records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before leaving the subscriber, state to him that his first issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> will come in two or three weeks. In a few words tell him about the world-wide campaign, so that he may understand that a tremendous number of subscriptions are now coming in to the office and that therefore a short delay should not cause him any concern. Please do </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NOT</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> TELL SUBSCRIBERS THAT THEY WILL RECEIVE COPIES OF </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">CONSOLATION</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> NEXT WEEK.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If the party wants his subscription to begin with any particular number, mark on the subscription slip coming in to the Brooklyn office “Begin with Issue No............. ”, If</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">your slip is not marked, we will mail him the current issue.</span></p>

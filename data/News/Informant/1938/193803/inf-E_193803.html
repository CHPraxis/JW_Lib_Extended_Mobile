<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>One Back Call a Week</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Each Company Publisher’s Quota</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">In order to properly build and plant’, we must bring to the people of good will the Kingdom message in such an effective way that these “other sheep” may be encouraged to break away from the Devil’s snare and take their stand alongside of Jehovah's witnesses. When we come in contact with people favorable to the Kingdom message, we now see that our obligation does not end with merely leaving with them the Kingdom truths in printed form, but we must go a step further, if we are to carry out oui<sup>-</sup> commission fully. That forward step is making back calls and thus aiding the interested ones to arrive at the point where they can and will be able to make an intelligent decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As organized units of Kingdom publishers throughout the earth, our individual privileges and responsibilities in the advancement of this back-call work are clearly defined. Service committees: Their obligation Is to stress this important feature of the work and to arrange that the back calls turned in are promptly attended to by the willing publishers. Company publishers: Each one should set as his quota an average of one back call a week, and be diligent in seeking and using every means available towards reaching this goal. Auxiliaries: Enjoying increased opportunities, these should set and reach a quota of two back calls a week. And finally, the pioneers: Because of their privilege of being able to be continually In the field (and this particularly In the case of the special pioneers), these should set and make their quota an average of five back calls a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To aid in reaching the quota set, each one should set aside a definite time for making back calls, as far as possible and practicable. Companies should set aside one or two evenings a week as back-call periods. Pioneers can use evenings and daytime for this particular work. If we plan our back-call work as we have planned and do plan our regular witnessing work, we shall enjoy the same degree of increased opportunities and blessings from the Lord’s hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When making back calls, be prepared always to offer at least an assortment of four bound books. And, furthermore, be on the lookout to make each back call grow into a model study meeting. Remember your quota. One back call a week.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Are You Ready to Do Your Part?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The importance of the &quot;Companions&quot; testimony period, April 9-17. cannot be overstated. It commences the greatest campaign that the Lord has entrusted to his people to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The campaign is international in its magnitude, and its objective is the distribution of ten million of the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> and one million bound books, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, </span><span class="font1">and 100,000 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> subscriptions. The “Companions” testimony period should see this objective well on its way and a good percentage of the work accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Concurrent with the announcement of this special campaign comes the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> carrying the &quot;Jonah” article, emphasizing above everything else the need of absolute obedience to organization instructions. Some of the significant statements in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> are quoted here to refresh our memories and show us their close relationship to tills campaign:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“During the World &quot;War there was a side-stepping of duty which God laid upon his people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“To be silent about the kingdom and especially God’s announced vengeance against all of Satan's organization was also an effort to flee from the presence of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These quotations indicate the tremendous responsibility resting upon each one of the anointed and their companions in connection with this and all other campaigns which the Lord inaugurates through his organization. No one can escape it. No one can get someone else to substitute for him. All must bear their responsibility before the I,ord, individually and as an organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As an organization, the responsibility rests upon the service committee and company servant to make the necessary preparations. Have you. as a committee, carefully studied the February </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> and started planning what territory is going to be used for this campaign and how you are going to work it? Have you ascertained the available publishers and taken the necessary steps to help those publishers who are hindered by obstacles which they need assistance in overcoming? Have you checked your stock of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies. Riches,</span><span class="font1"> phonographs, records, and have you seen io it that the necessary orders for an adequate supply have been forwarded to the Society? Have you planned for the necessary sample copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation?</span><span class="font1"> Have you seen to it that all names </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font1">good-will persons in your files are properly arranged so that they can be distributed to the publishers holding the various assignments, to make back calls upon them with this special offer, and the numerous other Ihings for which you, as a service committee and company servant, are responsible, in order to make this campaign a success in your locality?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As an individual publisher, are you planning now for this campaign? Is your personal equipment arranged for phonographs and records? Are you planning your time, budgeting it so that you have definite periods set aside each day for participation in the Kingdom service—days which are to be devoted to the field service, and nothing permitted to Interfere with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All of these things are details for which each and every one of us is responsible before the Lord, and we manifest our dependability by carefully looking after them. The Lord has entrusted us with our biggest job to date. Can he depend upon us to do our part? The companions, both anointed and Jonadabs, will answer “Yes”, and mean it, because they are trustworthy. Are you ready to be one of the 30,1)00 publishers in action during the April campaign and present to the nations the real CURE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">What We Want to Do</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have our job outlined for us by the Lord through his organization. Our commission from the Lord is clear-cut and definite. We must carry the warning to the people; then the responsibility is theirs. The question facing each one, therefore, is. Are we. like Jonah, going to flee from the presence of Jehovah, or are we going to be like the class described by the prophet Isaiah who joyfully say, ‘Here am I, Lord; send me’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We know that the latter describes the spirit and zeal of the Lord’s true people now. and we are confident that the United States will reach, and probably exceed, the 30,01)0 publishers for which we have been looking forward during this period. Let each one do his part, looking to the Lord to direct the issue. And now, as we come to attention in the Lord's army, what is to be our personal quota for this campaign?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneers and Special Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> Books Subscriptions 1000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Prepare for April Campaign</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">During the three-month campaign with the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font1"> each publisher will want at least one or two sample copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> to take in the field with him. These sample copies should be current issues. The Society will not consign to the branches, nor to companies, any extra copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font1"> For your extra supply it will be necessary for you to place an order. This order should be in before April 1. Companies should decide now how many extra copies they want of each issue and then place an order for Distributors’ copies. A special rate is allowed on Distributors’ copies when five or more copies of each issue for a year are ordered. The rate for such is 60c per subscription per year </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font1"> the United States; 80c a year in other countries. Or at least for this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font1">campaign get a six-month subscription at 30c and be supplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every company should take care of this matter immediately and get the brethren used to asking for these extra copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> every two weeks at company headquarters. By the time April comes around your organization should be functioning in good order, and by placing your orders now the Society will know how many to print and will be prepared to furnish the service necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Consolation Subscription Slips</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society furnishes these, slips free to pioneers, auxiliaries and companies, and you should order a supply so that you will always have them on hand—particularly for the “Companions” testimony period and the campaign that follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Auxiliaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Books &nbsp;&nbsp;Subscriptions</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">200 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Can it be done? The Lord can and will accomplish it if we joyfully respond. It will take hours in the field, and much energy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every branch is moving along at top speed. The wheels of the factories at Brooklyn and Berne are spinning. Hundreds of thousands of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure booklet</span><span class="font1"> are being turned out daily. Thousands upon thousands of the books </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> are being made ready. It takes tremendous preparation on the part of the factories and the branches to prepare for this greatest of all campaigns to be carried on by the Lord’s people against the Devil's organization. By the Lord’s grace the ammunition will be ready and in the bands of all the brethren</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Peak Reached in April 1936</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">26,250 Different Publishers Active This Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">How Is Your Local Increase?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Set out below are the totals for comparison of the number of publishers In the field. What will the next three-month report be? Better?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1937) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1936)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">October &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25,511 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23,761</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">November &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22,634 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22,139</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">December &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23,445 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21,166</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1938) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1937)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">January &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17,152</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">February &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21,318</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">March &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21,285</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The average number of publishers per month for this three-month period was 23,863 in 1937, and 22,355 in 1936. This is an increase of 1,508 publishers per month, which is splendid and just as we should expect. The great multitude is now being gathered by the Lord. When these people receive a knowledge of Jehovah and an understanding of his purposes they want to do the same thing that you are doing. Thus the ranks of the publishers increase. However, we have not yet reached the 30,000 publishers for which we are striving. Shall we do it by next April?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In order to find out how many different individuals were in the field during the three months we have gone through your reports and taken the highest number for each company during the three months, and totaled these, and by so doing we find there were 26,250 different persons in the field this fiscal year. However, the average was only 23,863 regularly in the field. This means that nearly 3,000 publishers failed to get into the field at least once a month. Every publisher should make it his business to report as a publisher at least once a month, if only for one hour; but report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Peak</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The greatest number of publishers ever engaging in the field service in the territory of the United States and countries under the jurisdiction of the Brooklyn office was 27,004. This total was reached in April, 1936. What will it be in April 1938, two years later? Shall we have an increase of more than 3,000 publishers and pass that 30,000 quota and establish a new peak? We should. The work is increasing, and more publishers are needed to do the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The witness must be given, and every company organization should now begin planning how it can aid and assist the newly interested ones attending its meetings to get into the field service also. No one should be forced or coerced to go into the field work, but in many Instances the service committee can make it more convenient for the brethren in the company to get into the field work. They can point out by the Scriptures their responsibility and stress the Importance of studying the Society’s publications, particularly </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> After feeding upon this food for a while they will see that their responsibility to the Lord is that of being a witness for the Kingdom. Special pioneers, pioneers, auxiliaries and company publishers should now begin to assist the newly interested persons in the witness work and show them how they, too, can be publishers for the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A good way to do this is for the brethren who live in the vicinity of the interested to make arrangements to call on them some Saturday afternoon or Sunday, or during the week, and take them along into the field and show them how it is done. Loan them your phonograph and a few books, take them from door to door for a few homes, and then let them do it for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When shall we reach the 30,000 in number of publishers? What is your local company doing toward reaching that mark? Have you increased in number of publishers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Four Books on Contribution of $1.00 During February and March</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Following the February special campaign and throughout the month of March, a four-book combination, featuring, of course, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of $1.00. We are leaving it to the publishers as to what other three books to use, having in mind that many of the companies have a surplus of certain books and will wisii to take this opportunity to reduce their surplus stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As an alternate offer, we suggest two bound books (including </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies')</span><span class="font1"> and fourteen booklets, consisting of six self-covered and eight colored-cover booklets. (Please note that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> is not to be offered before “Companions” testimony period).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Be prepared to place </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font1">singly on a contribution of 25c, or seven booklets on the same contribution. Booklets should never be overlooked in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A testimony card for the four-book combination is available; and if you desire a supply, they should be ordered. However, do not rely on the testimony card altogether, but learn to use the phonograph records as a means of introducing the literature. Both P-102 (“Riches”) and P-114 (“Enemies”) are excellent and should be used extensively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do not overlook foreign literature during this campaign, using the testimony booklet to introduce the books.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Orders for “Cure”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Follow</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">These Instructions</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Consignments of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklet will be sent to all the companies. But all the pioneers and auxiliaries must order their supplies of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklet: no consignments will be made to them. Shipments of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklet will begin to go forward on the orders received February 1 onward—and not before. Therefore the pioneers and others whose orders for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklets were received here during January will have to beobdeb them; for no attention was paid to orders for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> received here during January. Starting February 1 the consignments of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklets to companies will be added to the orders we receive. If no order is received from a company by March 15, at the latest, the consignment will be sent out alone. We hope, however, to receive orders from all the companies before that date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Foreign Languages</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There will be no consignment made of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklet in the foreign languages. All will have to order these. We shall have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> in the following three languages ready for shipment on March 1: Greek, Spanish, and Ukrainian. The brethren are requested to start ordering </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> in these three languages beginning March 1. Any orders received for these foreign </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklets before March 1 will be Ignored entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> is ready in the other languages In which it is soon to be printed, namely, Bohemian, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Holland-ish, Hungarian, Norwegian, Polish, and Swedish, announcement of this fact will be duly made in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font1"> Then, and, please, not before, start ordering </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> in those languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> is not to be used in your witness work before the “Companions” period.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Requirements: Use Phonograph Daily, Put In 200 Hours a Month, Do Extensive Back-Call Work</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Write for an Application and Details</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the Columbus convention Brother Rutherford announced a new work, and this has been under way for a few months. This new work is being carried on by the special pioneers. It is very gratifying to note that in December the 199 special pioneers placed over 45,000 pieces of literature and averaged 163 hours in the field. These 199 special pioneers made over 52,000 setups witli the phonograph in the month of December and made 1,922 back calls. They will put forth greater effort in their back-call work, and it is expected that they will more than triple this in the next few months. The back-call work is an important feature because it is by this means that we take care of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 4) </span><span class="font1">on time. During the three months January, February and March more than ten million copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> will be prepared and shipped, along with hundreds of thousands of copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font1"> During the three months following, April, May and June, by the Lord’s grace, every one of these publications will be placed in the hands of the people, so that they may take their stand. The “Companions” testimony period is the beginning of this world-wide onslaught. That period is only a few weeks distant. Have you done everything as to the preparatory work, so tliat you can move forward with your companions in united action?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Don’t begin with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> now, but be ready and start the biggest witness of the year with “Companions&quot; testimony period, April 9-17. interest we find in the field. Special pioneers are to organize small study groups along with their regular work and assist these persons in getting out into the field. Their main object is to find the people of good will and assist them to get into the organization of the Lord. Of course, this work is the same as every company publisher, every pioneer and every auxiliary is to do, but these special pioneers are putting forth an extra effort in this regard. They are being given special assistance from the Society so that they may concentrate on back-calling and using the phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Call</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A call is going forth for more volunteers for this special pioneer service. The requirements are 160 hours a month in the field witnessing, as minimum time. The quota of every special pioneer is 200 hours a month, which means 50 hours a week of actual witnessing. The work to be done is particularly in the northern part of the United States all the year round. The work is in big cities. Each special pioneer tries to make 15 or more setups a day with the phonograph, and from these setups makes as many back calls as possible in evenings or at other times during the day. The Lord has greatly blessed the special pioneer service, and those that are in it are averaging more than 160 hours a month. As spring comes on tins little band of faithful warriors will gradually increase their hours toward the 200 mark, which is the goal set for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This call goes forth to pioneers, auxiliaries or company publishers. Consider it. Take it to the Lord and see if you can Increase your interests in the Kingdom to the extent of being a special pioneer. Write the Society for more information. Why not be a special pioneer in March and be ready for the world-wide campaign in April with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Cure</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">An Excellent Three Months’ Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The publishers have put forth a greater effort during the first three months of tills fiscal year than during the last. On the average, 1,508 more publishers have been in the field regularly, and there was an increase in hours of 154,004. Another splendid thing about the report is the fine increase in number of books. That gives an evidence of the fact that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">liiches </span><span class="font1">are the publications that the people want and need. The brethren know this and are stressing it in their work. There is an increase in the work all along the line, with the exception of booklets and obtainers. We believe that the next three months will show an even better increase over that of the past year.</span></p>

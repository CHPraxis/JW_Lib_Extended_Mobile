<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Every Convention City to Receive</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Unprecedented Witness</span></h3>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Warning</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Released</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>For First Time in Convention</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah, the giver of every good and perfect gift, has a rich blessing in store for those who love Him. On September 9-11 the greatest assembly of Christian people will be gathered in a world-wide convention, there to receive the comfort and aid He lias always supplied. The consecrated will do their utmost to be at one of the convention points and hear Brother Rutherford address this international assembly at </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">8</span><span class="font3"> o’clock London Time, botii Saturday evening and Sunday evening, direct from Royal Albert Hall. That will be a momentous and thrilling occasion to everyone present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is expected that at least 100,000 people will be assembled to hear Brother Rutherford deliver the lecture “Face the Facts”. Not only Will those assembled in these halls hear, but arrangements are now under way for a nation-wide radio chain to carry this lecture to those who would not ordinarily come to a convention. This important message must be heard far and wide and be gotten to the people so they may take their stand on one side or the other. The only place one can hear the Saturday speech will be at the convention itself. Everyone will want to be there because of the extensive service arrangements that are being made and the distribution of the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font3"> for the first time. In approximately 50 cities throughout the world arrangements are now under way to accommodate those who will attend. Some of the things that must be taken care of are as follows, and you can share in them.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Convention Expenses</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In the cities where conventions will be held September 9-11, the brethren are asking the privilege of paying the expenses as far as is possible for them to do so. Any of the remnant or Jonadabs or others interested who are not in the vicinity of the local conventions and who desire to participate especially in the expenses of the general convention may make their remittances direct to the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Advertising</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Approximately a half million announcements for the convention have been printed for the use of the publishers in the back-call work between now and the convention. Any company, pioneer or auxiliary desiring more of these can order them. They will be supplied free. They should be used extensively. Letter* writing to those interested will play an important part in getting all people of good will to the convention. Placards are furnished by the Society to all convention cities for “sandwich sign” parades and automobiles. Companies locally are making silk screen signs and banners to place in conspicuous locations throughout the city, in store windows, at homes and other places. More than three million leaflets will be printed for advertising “Face the Facts” at the assemblies throughout the United States. All the publicity will be given that can be given relative to the world-wide convention and the big meeting. The greatest advertising that will be accomplished is that done by the publishers themselves in door-to-door witnessing, telling everyone they meet of this world-wide convention and where to attend. At the convention</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Order It Now</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The world-wide convention will have so many angles </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to cover</span><span class="font3"> and will be of such magnitude that it would be impossible to properly report the convention in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation. </span><span class="font3">Therefore </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font3"> will be published and will probably be a 64-page magazine. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger </span><span class="font3">will give you the details of the world-wide convention, including happenings in all convention cities. It will be a very comprehensive report, not only in items of interest, but also in picture review of the convention. This report everyone will want to keep on file, and some of the consecrated may want extra copies for interested people.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Message Must Be Told</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">As Brother Rutherford delivers his lecture “Face the Facts”, on September 11, the thousands of persons assembled in halls will not be the only persons to hear this important message. Arrangements are being made for a chain broadcast throughout the country. The stations selected will be particularly in locations not served by the convention cities, thus making it possible for thousands of other persons to hear this important message. Radio folders will be printed by the Society, listing the stations. These folders will be consigned to companies in territory served by the stations listed. Upon receipt of these folders, the publishers should distribute them before going to the convention. Every effort is being made to advertise “Face the Facts”, and every publisher from now until the convention should see to it that people are informed of this. The publishers, however, should point out to persons met on back calls the im-</span><span class="font2">cities particularly, the publishers will personally invite the people to the meeting when calling on them in the regular witness work. When </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font2"> find someone who is interested, not only give him a handbill, but arrange to call back with a car and take him to the meeting, both Saturday and Sunday. Several hundred cars at a convention can pick up from 1.000 to 2,000 people and bring them to the meeting. We want the people to hear, and an opportunity will be given them to hear. Bring them early.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Book Room</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A book room will be established and a large supply of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font2"> booklet will be on hand. Company publishers will be given the booklets at the regular company rate. Pioneers identifying themselves as such will be allowed the pio-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to cover the cost of publication and mailing, the Society will receive orders at 10c a copy. Where-ever possible, please place your order through the company servant and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font3"> will be shipped in bulk to companies. A remittance should accompany all orders. We should very much like to receive all orders by September 30, so we may know how many to print. It may not be until the latter part of October, however, when </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font3"> will be printed and mailed, because the reports from the convention cities in England and Australia will take longer to get here. Order your copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font3"> now, at 10c a copy. The convention report will not be published in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">portance of attending the convention rather than staying at home and listening on the radio, which carries only Sunday’s lecture. Therefore the publishers will stress the convention cities and the hails in their back calls as well as distribute handbills throughout the city in their regular witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Shortwave Reception</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The two lectures by Brother Rutherford are to be transmitted by shortwave to the United States and Australia from London. Anyone who has a shortwave receiving set might be able to pick up the two lectures of Saturday and Sunday within the band of 16 and 50 meters. The consecrated not able to get to one of the conventions but having a shortwave receiving set should try to pick up these lectures in the shortwave band belween the hours of 8 and 9 p.m. London Summer Time, September 10 and 11. Report of reception will be appreciated at the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">neer rate. The publishers can bring with them other books and booklets they desire, and especially bring their phonograph and records. If you run out of books, such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font2"> at the convention, these can be replaced at the convention book room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Cafeteria</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each convention organization is arranging to operate a cafeteria. Good, wholesome food will be served. The money you spend at the cafeteria will be used to defray the expense of operating the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Immersion</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There will be an immersion service Sunday morning at 8 o’clock. Those desiring to be immersed will bring their own swimming suits and towels, and will assemble in the first few rows in the auditorium, directly in front of the platform, at the time of the baptismal discourse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Music</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those who play musical instruments should bring them along, as an orchestra will be arranged. Bring your own song books. The songs to be used at the convention are numbers 6, 10, 42, 52, 60, 63, 92, 98, 101, 148, 283<sub>?</sub> 292, 312, 321, 331. These you can practice before you come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Parking</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Arrangements for free parking have been made in most cities, or at a very low rate. Trailer camps are being arranged for pioneers, at convenient places. For information on trailer camps write to the company servant of the city to which you are going. Names and addresses are listed elsewhere herein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We want everyone we can possibly get out at the public meeting to hear “Face the Facts”. It will mean hard work on the part of all the consecrated in making back calls, picking up these people and bringing them to the meeting to hear this message. Try to pack out every hall. The halls in the United States alone have a total seating capacity of more than 75,000 persons. Special programs are being printed for Sunday’s meeting. Each person attending will receive a copy. Those who come will have the privilege of hearing not only Brother Rutherford’s lecture “Face the Facts”, but also his lecture “Violence” as delivered at Seattle. The public meeting will be the high point of the convention, and every effort should be put forth to make it a success and a witness to the King and the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Service In the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Everyone attending the convention should have a share in the field service. Those who serve as ushers or work in the cafeteria or some other place should try to place a few booklets during the convention, turning in a report for the same. There should be at least 30,000 publishers reporting at these conventions. Report your activity in the field not only to the convention, but also to your home company. Each publisher will make out two reports : one for the convention and one for the company with which he is associated. Each company servant will report on his monthly report card the activities of the publishers in his company at the convention, as well as work done at home. Each car driver will see that he has an individual report from every publisher in his car, and turn these reports in daily. We want a report from every individual publisher because we want to be sure that more than 30,000 publishers engage in the field work in the United States during this convention period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Be a publisher during the world-wide convention. Take out into the field with you the newly interested. Show them how it is done. Let them place </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning </span><span class="font2">booklets, too, and be publishers for the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All company servants should announce between now and the convention the following : Report your activities of field service at the convention, on a worker's report slip. Make a duplicate of this slip, and on returning home give the duplicate slip to your local company servant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Jehovah’s Battle” Testimony Period - October 1-31 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Warning,” New Booklet, to Be Distributed</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Special Period</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>One Month in Duration</span></h3>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>World-wide Convention to Bring Out New Publishers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The international testimony period “Jehovah’s Battle” begins only two weeks after the world-wide convention, which convention should fill everyone who is interested in the Kingdom with much joy and zeal for the Lord’s cause. Due to the importance of these testimony periods and the special work that is always done, and to the fact that a nine-day period is not sufficient to cover the territory, the special effort by the brethren will be extended to take in the entire month. Henceforth the testimony period announced will be for the full month, thus giving the publishers opportunity to cover a wider territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font3"> will be the big thing for the month. On Saturday, October 1, let every publisher go into the field with a good supply of this new booklet and place it in the hands of as many people as possible. Offer the booklet on a contribution of 5c. Use the new phonograph records, “Relief” and “Resolution”, and arrange for back calls with “Warning” and “Violence” series wherever possible. Carry </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Riches,</span><span class="font3"> and other publications to offer to those who are exceptionally interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We want to cover as much territory as possible in this one month, and it is hoped that well over a million and a half of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Warning </span><span class="font3">booklet and other publications will be distributed in the United States alone. Thus far the greatest number </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">publishers to report in one month was 31,461. In October there should </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page l<sub>t</sub> column</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Cars</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All sound-car operators should take their equipment to the convention. Receive your instructions locally as to where to work, and use the “Relief” and “Resolution” records. You can read the announcement on the ’‘announcement folder” over the microphone, inviting the people to the local meeting. Be sure to announce the exact time of the meeting, and the hall and its location. Each sound car will have along a supply of the public meeting folders to be given out to the people passing by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Traffic</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren driving cars should be sure to have with them their driver’s license and ownership license. Observe traffic regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Rooming Accommodations</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those going to the convention and desiring rooms m advance should write to the convention headquarters as announced in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> stating what you desire in the way of rooms. Be specific. If you write for rooms now you will be able to go directly to your rooms when arriving at the convention city, and thus save time. In your application for rooms state what price you desire to pay, the kind of accommodations, the number in your party, bow many to a room, etc. Those residing in convention cities should (on back calls) mention to interested people the matter of rooming accommodations. Maybe many of these will be glad to accommodate conven-tioners, and then the conventioners can arrange to bring these people to the meeting, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Information</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You will be able to get programs at the convention itself. In most places there will be an emergency hospital, for slight illnesses. An information booth will be found in each auditorium. Local companies are doing everything they possibly can for your comfort and convenience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Are you going to the world-wide convention ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Are you taking with you some newly interested ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It will, by the Lord’s grace, be the greatest convention ever held 1 </span><span class="font3">be fully that number out, if not more. After the world-wide convention many of the newly interested will also want to participate in the witness work, going out for the first time in this campaign. As this is an international campaign, not only will the consecrated in the United States engage in “Jehovah’s Battle”, but those in every nook and corner of the earth will fight shoulder to shoulder against their common enemy, the Devil and his organization. The message of “warning” must be given. For that reason the Lord provided it in booklet form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Beginning a New Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">October 1 begins the new fiscal year of the Society, and therefore great energy and zeal should be put forth. Reports thus far indicate that 1938 will be the greatest witness ever given in this country in the interest of God’s kingdom. We are thankful for this and grateful to the Lord for the share we have had in it. But of those to whom much has been committed more will be demanded ; therefore we look to the new year for greater privileges of service and will press the battle to the gate. So we begin with joy “Jehovah’s Battle”, another international testimony period, having a new booklet, new records, “Warning” and “Violence”, and, by the Lord’s grace, many new publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new organization which will be in effect throughout the country, beginning with October 1, will greatly aid in the advancement of the Kingdom Interests. The company servant should cheek up on all details relative to this special campaign, “Jehovah’s Battle.” The territory servant should see that all</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Halls</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Under the name of each city where there will be a convention is the name (and address) of the convention hall. Then follows the name (and address) of the company servant, to whom you can write relative to rooming accommodations and other convention matters.</span></p>

There is no reason wliy the sound servant and other assistants to the company servant should be kept from taking care of their duties while sueh discussions are going on.

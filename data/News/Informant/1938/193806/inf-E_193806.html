<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Three Million </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> June Objective in United States</span></h5>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Requires Bold and Untiring Effort</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">The “Boldness” Testimony Period, June 4-12, appropriately comes near the climax of the greatest world-wide campaign ever enjoyed by those who love the Lord and are caring for the Kingdom interests. Upon the outcome of the bold effort each one puts forth during this period depends whether or not you will meet your individual and collective quota by June 30. Each one should put forth the greatest effort ever made during any nine-day period, so as to attain our objective of distributing three million </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> booklets during the thirty days of June. We must do this in order to successfully complete the work set before us. Unquestionably, this is the Lord’s time to bring forth the great multitude, and every one of the companions can testify to the awakening of these people of good will. Each one, whether he is in a large or in a small company or is an Isolated publisher, can with boldness freely present to the people this message from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">June 4 begins the “Boldness” Period, and all of June should be dedicated to the Anal siege of the Devil’s crowd with the wonderful provision given us by the Lord, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Cure, </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font2"> All must work. Everyone who truly loves the Lord will have a part in this special witness. Service committees will see that all have sufficient territory and that all who were out In the field in April, as well as those newly interested since April 1, are given an opportunity to serve in June. Field parties will be arranged daily throughout the “Boldness” Period as well as during the entire month. Every publisher will make it his business to be in the field Saturdays and Sundays. The newly interested not yet publishers for the Kingdom will find “Boldness” Period a favorable time to exercise their trust in the Lord and share in tlie house-to-house witness. With favorable, warm weather and long days, there is every reason and incentive for everyone to get out in the witness work; and that means at least 30,733 publishers. We did this in April and, by the Lord’s grace, we can do still better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">More Time Required</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the first time in the United States our quota of 30,000 publishers was exceeded. It is really an occasion for rejoicing. These publishers, however, must put forth a more strenuous effort to keep up with our quota on literature. Remember, the quota for the U. S. A. is seven million booklets and 700,000 bound books in the three months. We should have had well over 1,800,000 booklets by the end of April, but we had only a little more than a million and a half. That means more time and greater effort must be put forth in order to reach this quota. May is complete. We do not know what the report is, but we feel sure it will be necessary to place three million booklets during June. It is necessary that each company publisher reach his quota of 20 bound books, 200 booklets and 3 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions. If we do this in the United States, with the 30,000 publishers, we shall greatly exceed our quota, having in mind the extra number the pioneers and auxiliaries will distribute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Evening Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Particularly during “Boldness” Testimony Period, evening work should be stressed. Service committees should pick out some thickly settled territory for this evening service. Arrange to leave </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> at every home. If you do not have enough territory, go over it again, because the people must receive this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> booklet. In this evening work, make your testimony short. Say something like this: “Have you received your copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Curef</span><span class="font2"> This is your copy. You may contribute one or two pennies, which will cover the cost of printing more of such booklets. Those who cannot contribute are welcome to it free, if you agree to read it.” In this way, in the evenings you will be able to cover considerable territory and in an hour or two leave about 20 or 30 booklets. Where people show exceptional interest, take their names and addresses and call back later with the phonograph, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font2"> Those who have not yet started as regular witnesses can try this evening work. Have in mind, however, that on Saturdays and Sundays and other times you will go ahead with the regular testimony : phonograph setup wherever possible, and offer the full combination for a dollar. The above-outlined evening arrangement will help your company to reach its quota by June 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those brethren who find interested parties in their regular witness work should be sure to make back calls in the evenings. Back calls have proved a splendid source for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions. Those companies that are faithfully making back calls are finding that newly interested ones soon show up at their meetings, and this Increases their publishers. Many persons making back calls are now leaving with these interested people 20 or 30 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font2">booklets to distribute among their friends. Why not do likewise? This will help the company to reach its quota by June 30. Company publishers should report these placements on their daily report slips. Companies failing to make back calls and report them are not properly caring for the Kingdom interests in their territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The phonographs, sound cars and sound boats were made to ‘talk’. The brethren should see that the sound equipment is kept talking. June is an excellent time to put into fulltime operation all your sound equipment. Keep it busy during “Boldness” Testimony Period. Those operating sound cars should hand out </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> booklets to those interested in listening. This will help to make your quota by June 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">My Individual Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If every one of the publishers for the Kingdom reaches his individual quota, the world-wide quota will easily be met. The April report shows that many of the small companies of from 1 to 5 publishers are lagging behind. This is true also of some of the larger companies. Company servants should see that the publishers have ample territory, books, booklets and sample copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font2"> and lead them into the field on Saturdays and Sundays and witness as long as possible. Arrange your “Boldness” Testimony Period as outlined above. If each company will do this, then there can be no question as to whether or not you will meet your quota by June 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each pioneer has the responsibility of placing 1.000 booklets during the three months; and auxiliaries, 500. Are you doing it? Will you reach your quota by the end of June? It is suggested that the pioneers and auxiliaries give keener attention to and make more back calls on the interested ones they meet in the field. Reports show that many pioneers are not making back calls, and are missing a wonderful privilege of service. Try to leave </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> in every home you call on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Out Your Reports Accurately, Promptly</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Be sure to note the back calls made by the publishers during the month. If you have failed to report your back calls for April and May, include them in your report for June. See that you have a report from every publisher in the field, and include this in your monthly report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The campaign is well under way. Two months are gone, and there is much work to be done in June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The companions who fought so valiantly in April will, we feel sure, make great advances against the enemy and his organization during June. This campaign has greatly aroused the Devil’s organization, and the message is having a very telling effect. Remember your part in the world-wide quota, and if you make your quota the world-wide quota will be made. Make it by June 30.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Leave “Cure” with People</span></h3>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>We Have Millions More to Place</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">The reports for April show that we are lagging somewhat in the placements of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure.</span><span class="font2"> This is a most important message, and above everything else we should strive to leave a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> booklet with every person we meet. If you present the special offer first, and the person declines to take it, don't forget to leave a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">CURE </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">booklet. It isn’t necessary to do a lot of explaining. If one hesitates to contribute even a penny or two, then offer it free if he promises to read it. From reports we find that some publishers will place 40 or 50 of these booklets in three or four hours of work, whereas others will place only 7 or 8. In your service meetings, find out how those who are placing the larger number do it, then let everyone try to improve his own methods. Of course, in territory where many phonograph setups can be made not so many </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> booklets will be placed per hour, but the proportion of booklets left to the number of people you call on will be the same. In other words, if a publisher is calling on 40 or 50 homes and leaves only 7 or 8 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> booklets, then something is wrong. In order to reach our quota of 7,000,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font2">booklets for the United States, it means that at least every third home should receive a booklet. Some companies have set a special quota of 100 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> per publisher for the month of June. Good idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of course, we don’t want to let up on our efforts to place </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font2">and take </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions. Many people already have some of our literature and will show interest. When you meet these, put forth an extra effort to get a subscription and leave a book. But when people will not give you much time to explain the special offer, and you see they are about to dismiss you, hand them the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> booklet, and tell them it will explain more in detail why you have called.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Cure</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Foreign Languages</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> booklet is in stock in the following foreign languages, and can be had when ordered during June; Bohemian, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Ukrainian. The others are out of stock.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The figures appearing on the accompanying table tell the story of the “Companions” Testimony Period and the activity of the month of April much more eloquently than anything we can say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren throughout the country did an excellent job. They just took off their coats and went to work. We started off fully expecting to attain the 30,000 publishers mark for the month. We are glad to report we have exceeded it by over 700. This is the Lord’s doing. There were 30,733 different publishers who tasted the joy of service In April. This was 6,727 over the same period of last year. Let everyone who enjoyed this great privilege determine, by the Lord’s grace, to enjoy similar blessings each month from now on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The month of lune is here, with its “Boldness” Testimony Period. What will our publishers register-31,000 publishers? If we can have 30,733 out in April, there should be no difficulty in having over 31,000 out during the month of June. Those who are really the Lord’s joyfully respond. The Lord says they are willing in the day of his power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A brief analysis of the above figures, and comparison thereof with the quota, is interesting:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure:</span><span class="font2"> The quota up to May 1 was 1,856.000 copies. We actually placed 1,553,317. That leaves us running about 302,600 behind our quota. That means that In order to keep up with our quota in this country we shall have to put forth even</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Good News from Officials</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">Not all city officials are like those of Griffin, Georgia, who ruled that Jehovah’s witnesses must submit the divinely ordained work of preaching the gospel to the requirements of their local ordinances, or the witness work be suppressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Upon receipt of a copy of the Supreme Court decision in the case of Alma Lovell us. The City of Griffin, together with a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, </span><span class="font2">and letter of transmittal, the Chief Inspector of Police of a city in New York State advised:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I assure you that this Department has always treated your organization with every respect when in our city, and will continue to do so. Assuring you of our co-operation at all times ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Florida, where some of the officials have taken entirely too much authority upon themselves in regulating the preaching of the gospel, a mayor states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I wish to thank you for the wonderful little booklet you sent me. I enjoyed very much reading this little booklet. I am personally wishing you every success In your undertaking. We are sorely in need of a plan, whereby we can adjust our personal and National troubles. I have discussed the ordinance this city has with the police department and I think they fully understand what the Supreme Court said. Hoping you do not have any more trouble and wishing for you and your co-workers all good wishes for your success and happiness ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But it will take boldness during the June campaign. Not all officials are like the above - mentioned. We have the message. It is the truth. The people must be told.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">a greater effort than we have up to the present. In another section of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> the recommendation is made that special arrangements be made for evening work, setting aside about three evenings a week, from 6 to 9, during which all publishers who can possibly do so are to go out w’ith </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> alone. This booklet has gotten under the hide of the enemy from coast to coast, and throughout the wide world, for that matter, more effectively than any other one booklet we have distributed to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bound books: Our quota to May 1, 185,600. We placed 160,329, leaving us 25,271 behind. What are we going to do about this? Watch our presentation. When the prospect can not or will not take the dollar combination, do not drop immediately to the booklet offer; present the bound book and booklet on a contribution of 25e. Do this consistently and regularly and we shall bring up our placement of bound books to the quota requirements, we are confident. Then, when they cannot take the bound-book combination, leave them the booklet on any eontribu-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>How About Booklet Quota?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">Ever since the Columbus convention we have been talking 30,000 publishers for the United States. There w<sup>r</sup>ere that many individuals and more on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font2"> list. Well over 30,000 copies of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> were sent out monthly to the publishers, but never had 30,000 publishers reported. More than 30,000 individuals attended the weekly studies throughout the country, but there -were never 30,000 in the field. Jehovah in his due time brings together the multitude and shows to them their privilege of service, and during “Companions” Testimony Period, which began this grand fight against the Devil’s crowd, more than 30,000 publishers engaged in the field work for the first time. In the United States alone there were exactly 30,455 reporting. In addition to this there were 278 other publishers in outlying countries that regularly report to the Brooklyn office; and this brings the grand total to 30,733.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What are these 30,000 publishers going to do in June? What are these going to do about their individual tion they can offer, or free if they are unable to contribute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Subscriptions: We are all anxious about this, we know. Our quota up to May 1 was 18,555. Our placements, counting those that were actually in the office and which had gone through for filing, 15,223. That leaves us about 3,300 short. However, we are confident that with the subscriptions in the mail that had been taken prior to April 30, and those in the office that were in the mall being opened, and those going through for filing, they will more than cover this number; so we are confident there were well over 18,555 subscriptions taken prior to April 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is a grand and joyful campaign. The Lord’s blessing is manifest on every feature of it. Let’s keep it up. Here is what we have to do on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font2">alone. From April 9 to June 30 there are 83 days. To put out 7,000,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font2"> that means almost 85,000 booklets every day of the campaign. Our quota for April was 1,856,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure; </span><span class="font2">for May, 31 days, 2,614,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure; </span><span class="font2">and for June, 2,530,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure.</span><span class="font2"> For the 83 days, 7,000,000. Increase your efforts in June, and this part of the work will be done and a mighty witness will be given in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">quota, especially booklets? The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font2">booklet contains a message that must be placed in the hands of the people. The people must be able to take advantage of the knowledge contained therein, and before June 30 they must have an opportunity to take advantage of the special oiter on the back page. So it means that we must place our quota of 7,000,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> booklets in the hands of the people during April, May and June. It can be done if each one will follow out the quota set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">234 S.P. x 1,000 cu = 234,000 1,689 P. x 1,000 cu = 1,689,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">700 A. x 500 cu = &nbsp;350,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">27,832 C.P. x 200 cu = 5,566,400 278 P.O.C. x 200 cu = &nbsp;&nbsp;55,600</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">30,733 Publishers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 7,895,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Can we reach our quota of 7,000,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> booklets by the end of June? The answer to that question will be in your June report.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Consolation</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Subscriptions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">The large number of subscriptions received surely indicates Jehovah’s blessing on this new feature </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of our </span><span class="font2">work. The Kingdom publishers have responded with the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. With the experience gained, let us all now enthusiastically push this work during the remainder of the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You have often wished that your personal friends and relatives would take an interest in the truth. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Take </span><span class="font2">advantage of this opportunity to place in their hands a subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font2"> which may result in your realizing your wish. In addition to securing subscriptions </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font2">the field, the sisters can contact the butcher, ice man, grocer, bill collector; in fact, all who call at the house. The brothers should make it a point to see their business associates, such as cashier at the bank, attorney, insurance agent, doctor, etc. All these are good prospects No opportunity should be overlooked to place </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation, Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> in their hands. One publisher left subscription slips with one of his business friends and asked him to contact the members of the firm, with the result that seven subscriptions were obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Every good-will name in the company files should be taken and contact made before the end of the period. All these should be getting this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Consolation</span><span class="font2"> back call” from Brooklyn every two weeks, and this direct link with the organization will work wonders in enabling them to see the issue in its proper light and take their stand on the Lord’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A few pointers: Properly mark subscription slip as to “new” or “renewal” ; always send in slip, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not just transmittal sheet;</span><span class="font2"> send in subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> in only the languages In which it is printed, and state the language. This offer does not apply to renewals or to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Subscriptions are coming in fine. By the 18th of May we had </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">33,667 </span><span class="font2">new subscriptions.</span></p>

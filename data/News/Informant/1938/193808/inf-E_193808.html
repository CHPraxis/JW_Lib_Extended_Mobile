<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Important That You Attend</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On tliis page appears a letter from the president of the Society “to lovers of righteousness”. Read this letter immediately. Alter so doing, we feel sure your answer to the question in the first paragraph will be &quot;Yes” and that you will be at one of the convention outlets in this country or other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is with real joy that we announce tliis outstanding event for the Lord's people. The greatest convention of all times, international in scope, has been arranged for September 9, 10 and 11. Preparations are now well under way for the most unique and tremendous witness that lias ever been given through convention arrangements. This world-wide convention is so far-flung that it will be possible for practically every one of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions in the English-speaking world to attend the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are unable to express in words our gratitude to Jehovah for making this extraordinary provision through his organization for the assembly of his people, so that we may be further strengthened and aided in carrying on the warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brother Rutherford will address all the assemblies, of which there will be more than 50 throughout the world, direct from London, England. From this central location will come words of instruction and comfort, transmitted by the modern means of international and transcontinental telephone lines. Twenty-three auditoriums, hooked up in the same number of cities throughout the United States, will be so located that none of the brethren will have to travel far in order to share in the blessings of this, the greatest of all conventions. Y’ou will be there not only to share in the blessings, but likewise to take part in the tremendous witness to be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two Features</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On Saturday, September 10, Brother Rutherford, by tin* grace of God, will address this international assembly, speaking particularly to the consecrated. On Sunday, at the public meeting which will be extensively advertised throughout the world, he will speak on the subject “Face the Facts”. Royal Albert Hall, we feel sure, will be packed out at this meeting, and at the same time, we hope, more than 50 other large auditoriums will be filled to capacity. We must do our part from now until September 11 to advertise. The subject alone thrills us and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark9"></a>To </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lovers of Righteousness :</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">Will you put forth your best endeavor to advertise the kingdom of righteousness that will bring peace, happiness and life to humankind?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">September 9-11, 1938, a world-wide convention of Christian people will be held. London, Rugland, will be the key position. On Saturday, the 10th. at 8: 00 p.in., London Time, an address will be delivered specially for the aid and comfort of the Jonadabs and others who are seeking the way to Zion. On Sunday, the 11th, at the same hour, a speech will be delivered at Royal Albert Hall for the benefit of the public. That hall will be directly connected with many other halls throughout the English-speaking world, that all the people there assembled may simultaneously hear. Let everyone who is anxious to see God’s kingdom under Christ in full operation with its beneficent results io humankind make it his or her business to advertise that convention and urge the people who want to know the</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">truth to attend and hear the above-mentioned lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is one occasion to prove your love for God and his kingdom under Christ. With joy do your part, and receive the Lord’s blessings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">United States Receives Its Greatest Witness </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Three-Month Campaign Surpasses Every Other</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">New Peak in Publishers Reached in June</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">World-wide Convention Another Advance Movement</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The report for June, the final month of the three-month campaign with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> booklet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font1"> surpasses anything previously accomplished in the United States and the outlying countries reporting to the Brooklyn office. In the United States alone there were 31,110 publishers in the field—a new peak—showing the continued increase of the multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These brethren placed 168,579 bound books and 3,408,636 booklets. In June every publisher got down to business and put this campaign over the top. No wonder we are now hearing loud squawks from the “old lady” ! Including the 241 publishers in outlying possessions we find that the literature placed under the Brooklyn report makes a grand total of 3,597,730, the greatest witness given in any one month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And now for the three months’ work. It Is astounding! According to the reports there were 31,461 different publishers in the field during April. May anil June. Bound books placed, 480,453; booklets, 6,540.243. What joy this brings us when we see the strenuous witness that was</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark11"></a>July 19, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">given by the distribution of 7.020,09(1 pieces of literature in but three months' time! Surely this is the Lord's work and is marvelous in our eyes! All who have been privileged to share in this campaign can rejoice with their brethren in this accomplishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> will be going regularly to thousands of new readers, due to the campaign. In the United States 73,006 subscriptions were taken. Including subscriptions received from branches, the total to date is 89,961.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now we look forward to another great move against the Devil’s organization and for the Kingdom, namely, the world-wide convention. Surely we can expect every one of these faithful witnesses, who have fought valiantly and hard during the three-month campaign, to be in attendance at the convention which will be held internationally. Therefore, during September 9-11 we should have fully 30,000 publishers in the field pressing the battle to the gate. As soon as the final worldwide report can be obtained it will be published for your enjoyment and comfort. We rejoice to know that the battle Is God’s, not ours, but that we can carry the warning to the people in advance of the final battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Much Work for Each</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Publisher Before and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Face the Facts” is the subject of Brother Rutherford's lecture for September 11 which will be delivered at Royal Albert Hall, London, England. What a thrilling subject! The handbill being prepared to advertise this lecture states, &quot;Only once before in world history have conditions been anything like the present time.” Are you not anxious to have all people of good will hear about this? You are! The subject and handbills are going to arouse thousands of people of good will who want to “eace the facts” and know the truth. It is our privilege to see to it that they have an opportunity to know when and where this meeting will be held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So that They May Know</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society is preparing now to print millions of handbills which will be consigned to all the cities in which there will be an outlet of the international convention. Cities nearby tv ill also be consigned a few thousand of these announcement slips to be used in their regular witness work shortly before the con-venlion. I’lac.ards will be printed and furnished to the convention city companies. Sound cars will be used, 1 com now until the convention, throughout tlie land, announcing the convention and the nearest point at which the lecture can be heard. In order for the people to hear this message they must be in one of these auditoriums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the convention itself there will be the “sandwich sign” parades, the Sound cars and the distribution of tlie handbills announcing the local meeting. Bui more important limn the distribution of these handbills will be your personal contact by witnessing from door to door in the convent ion city and personally inviting everyone to whom you talk to come to the com ention, particularly to the public meeting Sunday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Your Work Before the Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Great publicity must be carried on before the convention, such as seeing that the &quot;announcement&quot; of the contention is pul in the hand of etery one of tlie persons for whom you have a Baek &lt;&nbsp;'all slip.

Publishers will invite the people to come to the convention, as well as arrange as many phonograph back calls as possible for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Every publisher who possibly can should be equipped with the phonograph and the records “Relief&quot; and &quot;Enemies&quot;. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font1"> will be offered for the first time, throughout the world, on a contribution of 5c.

<p><span class="font0">Peak of Publishers Expected</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During April there were more than 30,000 publishers in the field. In June a new peak was reached, of over 31,000. At the convention, what will it be?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every person interested in the Kingdom will earnestly endeavor not only to attend the convention but also to be a publisher. Even those who may be assigned to service in the cafeteria, or to some other duty, will endeavor to put in some time placing somewhere, somehow, the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Warning,</span><span class="font1"> so that everyone at the convention may be counted as a publisher and turn in a report slip. Those not assigned to some specific duty in connection with the convention organization will spend all the time possible in the field service, taking out the newly interested who come with you to the convention and who will want to be witnesses. Many of these will undoubtedly start out for the first time during the convention. Because of the enthusiasm and strength shown by the Lord’s organization, they will have boldness. With all these new publishers joining with you, we should surpass by far the 31,000 peak of publishers in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is expected that this will be the greatest witness ever given in any convention. Come prepared to witness for the King and Kingdom and you will receive the blessing of the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This is the Lord’s provision for them. It is the responsibility of the anointed and their companions to see that it is made available for them. In fact, to withhold this message from the people of good will would be ‘depriving the stranger of his rights’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Order “Warning”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Orders for this booklet should reach the office by August 15. We shall have a supply of these booklets for the orders by that time. In this order include such bound books and other literature as you require to finish out the bound-book campaign during September. No consignment of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font1"> booklet will be made to companies, pioneers or auxiliaries. Please order in the latter part of August, but not during the vacation period of workers at Bethel; and don’t wait until late in September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ing almost all of the English-speaking world, will be covered by this arrangement. In Australia it will be Monday morning, 5 a.m., yet our brethren there will anxiously await the message that will be brought to them. Even though it be Monday morning, they will advertise this public meeting extensively, and undoubtedly thousands of Jonadabs who recently attended Brother Rutherford’s lecture when he was there last spring will be on hand at that time in the morning to hear this message from the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">As you have noted in Brother Rutherford’s letter, his Saturday lecture will be “specially for the aid and comfort of the Jonadabs and others who are seeking the way to Zion”. It is essential, therefore, that all persons on whom back calls have been made during the past year be informed of this lecture. Every company throughout the country should make arrangements to assist in every way possible the newly interested people to get to this convention and hear this vital speech. The anointed of the Lord, of course, will be there. They know the importance of these conventions and the blessings that will be in store for them. However, this world-wide convention will include not only these, : but all persons who are seeking I truth and righteousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each city in which the convention is being held is arranging to rent halls sufficiently large to take care of the brethren who attend. The consecrated, including the Jonadabs, within each convention area, are given the opportunity to bear the local expenses of each respective hall, and such contributions as they desire to make can be made to the convention treasurer. Each local convention treasurer will hold these funds for the Society, keeping a separate account and paying out such amounts as are required. If there is</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Special Announcement</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Enclosed with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> are samples of the special announcement of the world-wide convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, September 9, 10 and 11. These announcements should be used from now until the day the convention begins, in your back-call work. All companies should go through their back-call files now and make special call on every one of these interested persons, giving them this announcement and all other information necessary so that they can attend the convention. Set out to these people the importance of being there Saturday and Sunday particularly. If you need more of these announcements, order them immediately. The importance of this work cannot be overstated. Every company should try to make arrangements so that every publisher in the company and everyone associated with and interested in the organization will be at one of the convention points announced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Great Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cities in which the conventions are to be held are now extremely busy preparing details for your accommodations. They are working on room assignments, cafeteria arrangements, territory for your field service work. Throughout the rest of the country your big interest is to continue witnessing in your own territory and make every preparation to be at one of these cities. As Brother Rutherford states in his letter </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font1"> July 19, this is truly an occasion “to prove your love for God and his kingdom under Christ”. We feel sure that this world-wide convention, September 9, 10 and 11, will have the greatest attendance of any convention to date. Will you be there?</span></p>

Offer them such assistance as you are able to render. Express to them the importance of the convention and the blessing in store. Arouse in them enthusiasm. Call again upon those \ou know are exceptionally interested. In other words, talk convention, advertise convention, prepare to go to the convention, and remember to leave the special “announcement” at every back call.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Eleven Million Pieces of Literature to Be Distributed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Some months ago Brother Rutherford outlined a campaign which calls for the greatest united effort ever put forth by the Lord’s anointed and their companions. This campaign begins April 9 with the “Companions” testimony period and will continue to the end of June. This is a period of nearly three months, and it Includes two testimony periods, “Companions” and “Boldness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The personal letter by Brother Rutherford to the witnesses of Jehovah throughout the earth which you receive with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> sets out the importance of this witness and shows that a warning from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">L </span><span class="font3">o r d’s Word must be given to “Christendom”. Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions are charged with the responsibility of giving this warning. So that this warning may be clear and understandable to the people, the literature that will be offered will be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and a new 32-page booklet, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font3"> which is full of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">fire </span><span class="font3">and contains a pointed message that every person in the world should have. The first printing of this booklet in English alone will be </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ten </span><span class="font3">million copies. The foreign languages will greatly add to this total. With Jehovah’s blessing and favor all of these </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklets and one million </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> (or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches)</span><span class="font3"> will be distributed in the three-month campaign. All the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklets must be distributed during these three months because of the special offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> made on the back of the booklet, which expires June 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Study the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklet carefully. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Know </span><span class="font3">its contents and be acquainted with the special offer. You will then most certainly be one of the “companions” who will ‘rise against her </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in battle’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A World-wide Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font3">this three-month period, April, May and June of 1938, a world-wide quota is being set for the distribution of the Kingdom message. It is confidently expected that the greatest number of publishers ever engaging in the field at one time will share in this mighty witness. In the United States alone we expect that there will be upward of 30,000 different persons ‘putting forth their best endeavors to carry this testi</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">mony </span><span class="font3">to those who have a hearing ear and to give warning to others’. So that this warning and testimony may be given the world-wide quota </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Is set at</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10,000,000 Booklets 1,000,000 Bound Books 100,000 New Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This will require a very extraordinary effort on the part of all those fighting for God’s kingdom. It means more than double anything ever done heretofore in the same length of time. For months past every branch of the Society in the world has made great preparation in announcing this campaign and seeing to it that It will be carried forward to the honor of Jehovah’s name. Think of it 1 10,000,000 of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font3">booklet, a million of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> (or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches),</span><span class="font3"> and 100,000 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Special Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As stated on the back of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font3">booklet, beginning with April 9 the brethren of the Lord and their companions will offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, Enemies</span><span class="font3"> (or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches),</span><span class="font3"> and one year's subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font3"> on contribution of the amount usually received for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> alone, which is a dollar in the United States and $1.25 in other countries. This is the finest offer that has ever been made to the peoples of the world, and surely never before has such a powerful message of warning been carried to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Introduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All publishers who are fortunate enough to have a phonograph and the &quot;Enemies” record will introduce this special offer by running this record. After persons have heard the “Enemies” record, which most forcefully shows them why they should study the book, it will be easy to present the special offer of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> along with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font3">on a contribution of only a dollar.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Brother Rutherford Writes to Witnesses </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'Entering Period of Unusual Importance</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Letter Going to Every </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Subscriber</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">This </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> which sets out the details of the campaign, Is being sent along with Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 31, 1938, which is addressed “To the witnesses of Jehovah throughout the earth”. A testimony card also is supplied. This letter is a great comfort to everyone who loves righteousness and who is willing to fight for the Kingdom under Christ. Because of the importance of this message from the president of the Society, it has been translated into every foreign language in which the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">magazine is published. All readers of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> will receive this letter in their own language, and we feel sure that after considering its contents all those who are not al-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Her in Battle’!!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">the people already have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, </span><span class="font3">then run the “Riches” record or some other disc that we know will arouse interest in the minds of those people who are seeking righteousness. The point is that we should use our phonographs extensively and show the people what a great advantage it is to them to have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> and to have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> coming to them every other Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Testimony Card</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is providing every publisher with a testimony card which sets out briefly why people of good will should take advantage of this special offer. You may find that handing the testimony card to the person first and then introducing the phonograph will be to your advantage in gaining entrance to the home. Or, if you find it to the best interests of the work to use the phonograph first, then do that. Many of the publishers will find it very helpful to direct the attention of the people to the announcement on the back of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklet early in their discussion to show w h y the people should have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Cure</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> Always bear in mind that this special combination is limited to these three months. At every home offer the dollar combination. If the people do not desire to have the magazine and cannot afford to contribute a dollar, then point out the great benefits that will be theirs by their reading the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font3"> which you may leave on a contribution of only 25c. If they cannot take even this, and have shown sufficient interest to listen to your mes-ready publishers will become such during this great witness with the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklet, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Rutherford states that we “are now entering upon a period of unusual importance” and that NOW we must deliver to the people the message of the hour. Will you deliver that message? If you are not a publisher now, provision is made in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> for you to get a supply of literature, so that you may engage in this greatest of all campaigns. If you are located in territory where a company organization already exists you will be furnished the name of the company servant, whom you should contact immediately and avail yourself of the privilege in working with the witnesses of Jehovah throughout the earth. sage and would like to read something, then leave them the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font3">booklet on a contribution of a penny or anything they wish to give. If they cannot contribute, and are willing to read, and promise to read it, leave them the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklet free. We must leave the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklet in the homes of more than ten million interested persons in these three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Three-Month Siege</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the privilege of the publishers of the Kingdom in the United States to place seven million of the ten million </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklets printed in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">English language. To place these seven million of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklet is a tremendous but possible task. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To </span><span class="font3">do this it will be necessary to reach at least fourteen million homes. That will mean that each company publisher in the United States must call on at least 500 homes In these three months and leave the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font3">booklet in 200 of them. The Individual quota for each company publisher is 200 booklets, 20 bound books, and three subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font3"> in this three-month period. This tremendous task of distributing seven million of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font3">booklet and hundreds of thousands of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> (or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches), </span><span class="font3">and obtaining thousands of subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> can be accomplished if each individual takes upon himself the responsibility of doing his share of the work. The auxiliaries and the pioneers have a higher quota than that of the company publishers. Each one of the auxiliaries during this entire period will, by the Lord’s grace, place 500 booklets and 75 bound books and obtain six </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions. The full-time publishers—the pioneers and the special pioneers—have the privilege of making a quota </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of 1,000 </span><span class="font3">booklets, 150 bound books, and 15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions. If everyone in the United States attains this personal quota for three months, the quota for the United States will be attained and the world quota will be met! What an opportunity I What a witness this will be to Jehovah’s name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">If You Have Never Been a Publisher</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Carefully consider Brother Rutherford’s letter to you. This letter, along with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> has gone to more than 43,000 persons. Instructions of how to carry on the field work, as set out in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font3">month by month, go to the same number regularly. This shows that there are many interested persons now reading the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine who do not report as publishers of the Kingdom. The greatest number of publishers ever engaging in the Kingdom work at one time in the United States has been 27,004. That means those who are feeding upon the Lord’s Word in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>

These are called “Distributors’ Copies”, because it is understood that these are to be used as samples in advertising the magazine and in securing additional subscriptions. The rate for Distributors’ copies is $3.00 per year for five copies of each issue to one address; and 60c for each additional copy per year. If less than five copies are ordered to one address this special rate will not apply, and the rate is then $1.00 per year for each copy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Never before, to our knowledge, has there ever been printed any publication whose first printing was ten million copies. Never before has there been a booklet released in 15 different languages at the same time for world-wide distribution. Never before has the same piece of literature been prepared and held in readiness in every principal country of the world for distribution on a given date. All of these things which have never been done before are now being done with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklet. In the English language alone we have nearly completed the printing of ten million copies. By April 1 all of these will be printed. Added to this there are hundreds of thousands of copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> in 14 other languages being prepared for the countries where they are to be used as well as for those people in the U.S.A, who speak those languages. April 9 will be the beginning of the greatest campaign that has ever been waged against the Devil’s organization by Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">News flashes from all parts of the world show that the brethren and their companions are ready for this great campaign. They have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure. </span><span class="font3">They have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font3"> They have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Con</span><span class="font3">language except English, Greek, Spanish, Ukrainian and Portuguese, as there are no other languages in stock yet.

Order what </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> you can distribute, as no consignment will be made to those in these branches of service.

To make it convenient for you there is printed elsewhere herein a coupon which, when properly filled out and sent in to the Watch Tower Society, will bring to you </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and sufficient instruction that you may be associated in this greatest of all campaigns giving witness against the Devil and for the Lord and His kingdom. There is every reason why there should be over 30,000 publishers engaging in the field work in the United States alone during the w o r 1 d-wide “Companions” testimony period. We are all companions in the Lord’s organization desirous of doing one thing— having a share in the vindication of Jehovah's name and word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In order to really assist the people of good will who show interest in your first call, it is necessary for you to make a back call on them in the evenings or at any other time at their convenience with the records “Safety”, “Exposed,” “Worshiping God” or “Religion and Christianity”.

<p><span class="font3">Every effort should be made on the part of the company servant and the service committee during the next five weeks to contact every’ person in the company’ who has been a publisher or is a publisher, and find out if there is anything you can do to assist them to get into the service during this special campaign. As the last </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> pointed out, we have heretofore reached a peak of 26,250 publishers, and in order to bring this up to 30,000 publishers each company should increase its number of publishers 15 percent. In other words, if you had 100 publishers as your peak during October, November and December, then you should have 115 in April. As is point</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even if they’ do not take </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation, </span><span class="font3">and are willing to hear, arrange for them to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every company’ organization should keep a list of the names of those persons who subscribe for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font3"> and should see that these people are given attention during the campaign in the back-call work. The Society will receive thousands of new subscriptions because of the placing of ten million of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> booklet throughout the world. When we receive subscriptions direct from the newly’ interested, the names of these persons will be sent to the company organizations in whose territories these interested persons live; and when the companies receive these good-will slips they will please make a back call on those persons at an early date. We want to give all the people of good will a full opportunity to get a knowledge and understanding, so that they may take their stand on the side of the Kingdom. Persons of good will whose names you already have in your back-call file should be called on again during the threemonth period, so that they may be able to obtain this special offer of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> (or any other book) along with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of a dollar. Every one of the Lord’s anointed and their companions will pay’ special attention to the back-call work during April, May and June. Remember to report back-call activity.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Reports for April, May, and June</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Report cards will be made out the same as heretofore for April, including the report from the first day to the last, and the report for the testimony period alone in the space provided for this purpose. At the bottom of the report each company servant, pioneer, auxiliary and special pioneer should make the following notations: Number of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions sent in to the Society during the month; number of back calls made during the month; and on the April report, of course, the Memorial attendance and the number of partakers of the emblems. Write it as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Consolation” Subscriptions____</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back Calls___</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Attendance___</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Partakers____</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> copies should not </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be re</span><span class="font3">ported as booklets, whether you leave them as sample copies or not. Pioneers and auxiliaries may report Memorial attendance and Memorial partakers in only such cases as are isolated from a company gathering. Where a group of pioneers gather for Memorial in isolated territory, one of them should make the report for the entire assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ed out elsewhere, there are 10,000 to 15,000 persons associated with the company organizations that are not now publishers. What are you doing to assist them in this work? Are you taking full advantage of your back-call privileges? Are there sufficient studies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> organized for the convenience of the brethren? Do you have weekly service meetings? Are they well arranged? Are they interesting? Are you doing everything possible to assist those people who love righteousness and the Kingdom to get into the field work? We can reach the 30,000 quota provided every company does its share by increasing its number of publishers 15 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">want to miss this opportunity to again share in the Kingdom work. If you have not yet been a publisher for the Kingdom, we feel sure that you will want to make every effort to share in the proclamation of the good news now, by availing yourself of the special offer set out in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> By the grace of God this campaign will be the greatest that his organization on earth has ever waged, and it is our privilege to rise up against the enemy in war. Knowing that our warfare is to bear testimony to J e h o v a h’s name, we sing forth his praises.</span></p>

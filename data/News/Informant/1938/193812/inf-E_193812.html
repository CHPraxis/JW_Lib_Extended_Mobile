<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>The Multitude Must Hear</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On September 11 Brother Rutherford delivered the lecture “Face the Facts” before a vast audience, both </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">visible and </span><span class="font2">Invisible. Thousands </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">those who heard have already </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">heeded </span><span class="font2">the admonition given and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">are now </span><span class="font2">on Jehovah’s side fighting </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">for the </span><span class="font2">Kingdom. Millions more will </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">be given </span><span class="font2">the opportunity to hear. Are you, as a publisher for the Kingdom, ready to move forward in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">greatest witness yet given? </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A glorious fight is just ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The world-wide witness will begin January 1, 1939, and continue until April 30. This period of time includes two testimony periods. When </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">you see </span><span class="font2">the names of the February </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">April periods on the Calendar </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">you </span><span class="font2">will more fully appreciate the Importance of the work and the mes</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">sage </span><span class="font2">that must be given. “But it is wintertime,” someone says. Does the Devil’s organization stop fighting in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">winter? No. Neither will Jehovah’s witnesses. The time has come to press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This four-month campaign is generally known as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Watchtower </span><span class="font2">Campaign” because the most important magazine ever printed will be featured. The special offer consists of a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Riches</span><span class="font2"> or any other bound book published by the Society, and the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font2"> all on a contribution of one dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> is the means used by Jehovah to feed the lovers of righteousness, and we must see that they get this magazine. To those who cannot subscribe for a year, offer a six-month subscription for a contribution of 50c, with a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> free, but not </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">bound book. Those who want just a bound book should be offered </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Riches</span><span class="font2"> or some other recent book, along with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 25c. Persons who decline to subscribe for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> or to take the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">book </span><span class="font2">should by all means get a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts.</span><span class="font2"> Stress the importance of this booklet at every </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">place you </span><span class="font2">call; and when nothing </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">else </span><span class="font2">is taken, offer </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tor</span><span class="font2"> anything they wish to contrib</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ute, or free if they are sincere, </span><span class="font2">express a desire to read, and are unable to contribute. In order to place the millions of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font2">booklets, we must try to leave a copy at every home, even though they will not consider </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> or bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This campaign is as far-reaching as any radio broadcast has ever been, because we expect in four months’ time to call on at least fifteen million homes in the United States, two-thlrds of which should take </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts.</span><span class="font2"> That means work; so plan now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Face the Facts” In Foreign Languages</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because of Its Importance, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> Is being translated In every language possible, so that it can be placed in the hands of anyone who will read. Just as fast as these booklets are published In the various languages announcement will be made in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> and the company servants and pioneers should order the supply necessary for their territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The World-wide Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The quota for this campaign has been set at 100,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions, one million bound books and twelve million </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts. </span><span class="font2">That means that every month at least three million booklets and 250,000 bound books must be placed, and 25,000 subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> obtained. If each publisher strives to make the individual quota set out elsewhere in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> the world-wide quota will be reached without difficulty. It isn’t high. If we place the Kingdom above everything else, put in the hours in door-to-door witnessing, in back-call work, and talk the Kingdom every hour of the day possible, this quota of twelve million booklets, one million books and 100,000 subscriptions will be easily reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">New Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since the world-wide convention of Jehovah’s witnesses thousands of newly interested have been coming to the company studies. These are beginning to see their privilege of service and their responsibility, and we should do all we can to assist them. The campaign begins on Sunday, January 1. Monday, January 2, will be a holiday for most of the brethren. With these two full days </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to devote to the service, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign should get off to an excellent start, and we sincerely hope that at that time there will be 35,000 publishers In the field, shouting aloud the praises of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">For the Aid of the Publisher</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah has been good to the people in the earth who want to be his witnesses, by providing them with equipment. In this campaign one of the best instruments we have is the phonograph. Thousands of these are in use in this country, and every month more are being sent out. For the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign Brother Rutherford has made two new records, which will assist the publishers in obtaining </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions and in making back calls. “Miracles,” P-153, is a splendid record to run for the people at the door, because it makes them want to hear the thrilling speeches “Face the Facts” and “Fill the Earth”. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">4i</span><span class="font2"> minutes through this short speech Brother Rutherford will arrange a back call for you. All you have to do is to set the date and take the other records to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The other side of this disc, P-154, entitled “Instruction”, tells the people in a convincing, pleasing manner why they should read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> After running this record all you will have to do is to show the people a sample copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font2"> then tell them about the special offer. You can show them how to use </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and inform them where studies are held in the city and how they can get there. You may be able to call for them with your automobile. Anyway, they need the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">magazine. They should study it, and if they do they will soon become a part of the Lord’s organization. This is a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign. We must talk </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> We must use this record “Instruction” to obtain </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions. Therefore the phonograph is going to be a great aid in this campaign in reaching our quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Additionally, for the benefit of those persons who do not have a phonograph, Brother Rutherford has provided a testimony card, which is being consigned in a few days. Every publisher should have one of these testimony cards, particularly those publishers who do not speak English very well. The Society is trying to aid the publishers in every way possible to make this the greatest of all campaigns. Our equipment consists of a new record, a new testimony card, sample copies of the latest </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, Face the Facts,</span><span class="font2"> the bound books, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription blanks, back-call slips, and plenty of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">time for field work and back calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you are not able to obtain </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions on the first call, but the people show interest and take a bound book or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font2"> arrange for a back call. Take with you one of the recent series of records, such as “Fascism or Freedom”, “Fill the Earth,” “Face the Facts.” Run the lecture through completely, then answer such questions as they may ask. Again present the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine. Call back a week later at their convenience, and run “Fill the Earth”, preceded by “Miracles”, and then we suggest you close with Brother Rutherford’s record “Instruction”. Even though they have heard It, let them again hear why they should read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To all persons subscribing for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> point out the Importance of their attending </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">studies as well as service meetings. Thoroughly acquaint these people with the work the Society is doing. Give them an opportunity to read, and check up each time you call to see if they have any questions on the material they have studied. Keep in mind that all this time spent in back-call work is counted as time in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Servants In the Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As a result of the new organization which has recently taken place, the Lord’s people are now better equipped to enter a campaign than ever before. The servants in each company have an important part to perform in the preparations for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign. Every one in the company must look well to the Kingdom interests committed to him, but the appointed servants have an added responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Company Servant,</span><span class="font2"> have you checked with all assistants? Have you cared for all of the detailed arrangements for this campaign that are necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Stockkeeper,</span><span class="font2"> have you ordered the literature for this campaign? Do you have your supply of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts!</span><span class="font2"> Is your consignment on the way? Do you have plenty of bound books. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Riches,</span><span class="font2"> and others? Are your sample </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font2"> ordered? Is your Distributors’ subscription entered with the Society? Are you in position to supply every publisher with the weapons of war?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Secretary,</span><span class="font2"> are you prepared to assist the company servant in every detail? Will you be out in the field with witnessing parties weekdays, evenings, Saturdays and Sundays? Have you made arrangements for the handling of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions? Are you thoroughly acquainted with all of these details?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Treasurer,</span><span class="font2"> are you prepared to as-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">column 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Help Your Back Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By now thousands of sets of the new records “Face the Facts”, “Fill the Earth” and “Fascism or Freedom” have gone out to the publishers. These records should be kept in constant use, not put on the shelf and allowed to remain idle. Those who heard these lectures when they were originally delivered will never forget those thrilling occasions. But now we must take these messages from the Lord to millions of people and warn them of what is about to come to pass, so that those who desire life can forsake religion and take their stand on Jehovah’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the time the radio chain was being arranged for “Fascism or Freedom” many companies throughout the country were anxious to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lecture “Fill the Earth” to Start Off Special Campaign</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Every publisher, every person attending studies, and every party on whom back calls are being made, should be sent a special invitation to attend the lecture “Fill the Earth”, to be given during the week beginning Sunday, December 25, in your kingdom ball. We recommend that the time chosen be your regular service meeting. By using two phonographs, you can run the entire lecture “Fill the Earth” in 50 minutes. Following this, 20 to 30 minutes should be devoted to the service meeting, at which time you should set out the final details of the campaign and arrange for the witness on Sunday, January 1, which is the first day of the world-wide campaign with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> and a bound book, either </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of one dollar. It will also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font2"> 4) slst the company servant in taking some of the witnessing parties to certain territory? Are you prepared to handle the remittances which should go forward with orders and subscriptions? In large companies the treasurer may assist the secretary in handling subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sound Servant,</span><span class="font2"> are all the phonographs owned personally and by the company in good condition? Have you checked them over? Are all the phonographs the company owns loaned out to publishers for regular use? Above all, do you have enough phonographs? Are your records in good condition? Have you ordered through the company servant the new series of “Face the Facts”, “Fascism or Freedom,” “Fill the Earth”? Do you have a good supply? Does every publisher in the company who uses a phonograph have the record “Miracles” and “Instruction”? If not, why not? Have you ordered them? Remember the special offer of P-153, P-154 at 50c until December 31. Get your supply now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Back Call Servant,</span><span class="font2"> are all the Back Call slips in good order and ready to hand out to publishers? Will every newly Interested person in your territory be called on and given the opportunity of hearing this new series of records and subscribing for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower?</span><span class="font2"> Have you a printed card inviting the people to your </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study? Have you arranged for series meetings in halls, schoolhouses and homes? Are have this lecture wired into their kingdom hall. Now you can reproduce that talk just as it was originally given, not only in your kingdom hall, but also in your home, in your neighbors’ homes, on back calls—in fact, you should spread it from one end of your territory to the other. Let’s show our zeal for Jehovah’s cause and turn on the heat on the Devil’s crowd. The religionists set up a great howl when these lectures were given over the radio. Let’s make them howl some more. In some places Catholic-Fascist opposition frightened radio stations into refusing the lecture after having contracted to take it. Are we going to allow the enemy to gain a victory in such places? No! Now is your opportunity to let the people know the facts, and also to let Jehovah’s enemies know that they cannot succeed in suppressing the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every name in the company’s back-call file should be gotten out and the person be called on with these new records. Make a definite be the first day on which we shall try to make our new quota of 35,000 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Talk this meeting during the whole month of December. Even though the lecture “Fill the Earth” has been run for the company before and you have studied it in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and used it on back calls, it should be run again for the aid and comfort of all the publishers as they move forward in this new campaign. We hope that in the United States alone at least 70,000 persons will hear this lecture during the week and that at least half of them will be publishers the following Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you have not ordered your new records yet, do it now. Be ready for the fight ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">you going to try to make January to April inclusive the greatest back-call period In the history of your company? Are you making arrangements for the thousands of interested people in your territory to hear these lectures?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Territory Servant,</span><span class="font2"> have you cooperated to the fullest extent with the back call servant to see that territory assignments are given to the publishers so that they can work every day in the week? Have you prepared your territory for this campaign so that you are sure all of it will be covered in the four months? Have you arranged with the company servant and his assistants to have witnessing parties every day in the week for this four-month period, particularly Saturday afternoons and all day Sunday?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Fight</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sometimes we hear a publisher say something like this: “We have just finished a strenuous campaign, and yet we are going right Into a four-month campaign. Isn’t there any rest?” No, there isn’t. This isn’t a time of rest. It is a time of war. We can’t sit back now and wait two months for a nine-day period to come along, and then get out in the work. If we are for the Kingdom, everything else will be set aside and the Interest of the Kingdom will take first place. The Lord says, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and bis righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” appointment and have the people invite their neighbors and friends. We suggest that on back calls, as well as at meetings you arrange in halls and other places, an entire lecture be run at one time, without stopping after each record to answer questions or carry on a discussion. Let the people feel and appreciate the fire, the enthusiasm and the importance of these lectures as they were given in their original setting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to using these records on back calls, meetings should be arranged in halls, clubs, schoolhouses or any other place where you can get people to assemble. To aid in advertising such meetings, the Society has prepared a special folder with space for you to stamp in the location and time of meeting. These can be ordered immediately. They are 40c a thousand to companies; free to pioneers. Make back calls, and plenty of them. Use the records, so that they may hear. But the back calls must be made.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Reporting Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The new report cards for pioneers and companies provide a space for reporting new subscriptions. In this space should be reported all new subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font2"> whether for six months or for longer. Never report renewals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Company publishers will report new subscriptions on their “Publisher’s Field Service Report” slips. Strike out the heading “Number of Persons Obtaining Literature” and write in the heading “Subs”, and report the new subscriptions in this space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The company servant, before sending in the report card to the Society, should check with the secretary to make sure that the total number of new subscriptions sent to the Society during the month is reported on the card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every publisher, every company servant and all his assistants must now seek first the Kingdom. That doesn’t mean once a month or once in a testimony period, but means every day. All publishers who will share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name and word must now with zeal move forward as one army, united under Jehovah’s theocratic government, and show our zeal for the Kingdom. The fight is on. We are in the war and we know who will be the victor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Miracles” and “Instruction”, P-153, P-154, to Play Big Part in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Campaign</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">To aid the publishers in the field, a few days ago Brother Rutherford made two new recordings, P-153,154, entitled “Miracles” and “Instruction”. “Miracles” introduces the series “Face the Facts” and “Fill the Earth” and shows how Jehovah performs miracles today. It is a splendid record for arranging back calls. “Instruction” tells why a person should read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> Every publisher will want to carry and use this disc in the door-to-door work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From now until January 1 these records will be shipped at 50c each. Companies should order them in quantities. After January 1 the reg-| ular rate will apply, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of 70c per disc.</span></p>

All who love the Lord and are making the King’s work their first business in life will wholeheartedly engage in this world-wide campaign. They will be determined to make their individual quota, and much more if possible. To enable all publishers to know whether they are keeping up with their quota, the Society has supplied the “My Daily Kingdom Service” record sheet Each day the publisher goes out in the field, not only is he to make out a Publisher's Field Service Report (which report he is to turn in to the company servant at the first opportunity), but, also, he is to make record on the “My Daily Kingdom Service” sheet of the results of the day’s activity. In this manner each publisher will be able to accurately keep tab on the number of books, booklets and subscriptions he has obtained and see whether he has reached his personal quota and how much over his quota he has accomplished at the end of this four-month campaign. These “My Daily Kingdom Service” sheets are for the publishers’ own use—they are not to be turned in to the company servant, nor are they to be returned to the Society. Each one is to keep the “My Dally Kingdom Service” sheet in some convenient place where he can conveniently record his activities each day and can be daily reminded of what progress is being made and what more must be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The quota set for each warrior in the Lord’s army for this world-wide campaign is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers and Special Pioneers Booklets Books Subscriptions 1500 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Publishers Booklets Books Subscriptions 250 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">More than 50,000 “My Dally Kingdom Service” sheets will be sent to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> readers. If every one is alive to the present-day issue and will report to the company servant his activity, there is every reason for us to easily exceed our quota of 35,000 publishers. Also, if each one who is actively engaged in the witness work reaches his quota, we should readily attain our world-wide quota of 100,000 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer,</span><span class="font2"> one million bound books distributed, and twelve million </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> booklets. This is a big task that has been set before us, but, in spite of the ever-increasing opposition, we can successfully perform it if we all diligently do our utmost, by the grace and strength of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The 50c rate is made now because many thousands were made at one time. We expect that by January 1 the first order will all have been shipped out. In ordering, be sure to get one for every phonograph and sound car, and, if necessary, a few extra. A partial remittance should accompany every order for records. Balance will be charged to the company account, and remittance should be made aS you receive the money. Pioneers will be furnished one record P-153, 154 free on order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The two short talks by Brother Rutherford will play a big part in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Be ready </span><span class="font2">for action January 1.

<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Giving Booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Watch Tower publications are placed In the hands of the people to aid them to learn of their privilege of fleeing to God’s kingdom under Christ. Promiscuous giving of such booklets is not advisable, nor advantageous to the receivers, because most people receiving the same under such circumstances seldom read. Without reading the publication it does them no good. Many sincere persons today, however, are very poor and may desire such booklets or other literature for their comfort. If such persons when approached express their desire to read, then they should be given a booklet. Our advice, therefore, is that when such persons are found by publishers the publishers say to them: “If you will carefully read this booklet, I shall leave it with you, and if later you are able to make a contribution to aid others in having like instruction in the Scriptures, you may send such contribution to the Society.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">During the entire month of December, which is the “Faithful and True” Testimony Period, every publisher should stress the offer of the three </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> books on a contribution of 35c. At this amazingly low rate, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> 1, 2 and 3 should move fast, and we hope every company will make a special effort to clean out all its stock.

<p><span class="font2">It has always been found profitable for the Lord’s people to set a goal to alm at in their work. For the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign the Society recommends the following individual quotas:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Company</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark28"><span class="font2">Publishers Pioneers </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;250</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark30"><span class="font2">Subscriptions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">To aid the publishers in checking up on their progress each day during the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign, special form headed “My Dally Kingdom Service” is being provided for each publisher. The company servant should see that each publisher gets one of these sheets. They are for the publishers’ own Information, and are not to be returned to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each company should also set a quota, based on the number of publishers in the company. For instance, if you have had an average of 100 publishers during the past six months, then your company quota would be 100 times the quota for each Individual; or, in other words, 25,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font2"> 2,000 bound books, 400 new </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions. We suggest that each company prepare a “thermometer” chart like the illustration shown here, so that the publishers can see at a glance what progress is being made week by week. You will have one “thermometer” for booklets, an-meeting. Stress these books on back calls and urge every interested person to get a set. If the company places all its </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> stock, and has no more </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font2"> use </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy, Reconciliation,</span><span class="font2"> or some other bound book, for the remainder of the month.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Notice</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It has come to the Society’s attention that one W. A. Mason, of Macon, Georgia, Is sending letters to the brethren throughout the country offering to assist some pioneer if you buy pecans from him. Others claiming to represent this party go from company to company making similar profession. This is to inform everyone that the Society does not approve such, and that selling goods </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and soliciting money in this manner is contrary to the Society’s wishes.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">A testimony card will not be provided. Use your phonograph at every place possible, running the records “Relief”, “Resolution” or “Awake”. These records make a splendid introduction to the books and also help in arranging back calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As stated in the November </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> the number of sets of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> placed should be reported at the bottom of your report card, if you desire credit on your account.

<p><span class="font2">All pioneers, both special and regular, should promptly notify this office of each change of address. Always use the “Change of Address” slips provided by the Society. These slips are for the use of the pioneers only, not for companies. Send in notice of your change of address at least one week in advance of change if located In the eastern states; two weeks In advance if in the western states. Before mailing the slip, be sure that all the information called for, Including your complete new address, is plainly and correctly written out. A separate change of address slip is to be made out by each pioneer, whether witnessing alone, in pairs, or in groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Forwarding Mall</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each time you move, be sure to leave forwarding address at the post office. Also, before moving, call at the post office to see if there is any mail for you. First-class mail is forwarded to your new address without charge, but not third-class mail, such as rolls of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation, The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font2">Such mall Is forwarded by the post office only on receipt of proper postage. If you do not supply the postage when notified by the post office, or do not leave a forwarding address, the post office returns the package to the Society and we have to pay postage for its return. In addition, we have to check and trace to find your new address, which results in considerable delay. This delay and expense is avoided when pioneers follow instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Just before any mail is sent </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">pioneers, all the change of address slips in the office are put through. Therefore, If these slips are in here in time and made out correctly, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">you </span><span class="font2">will receive your mail promptly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">It was thought a year ago that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> might be published in the Arabic language. Sufficient subscriptions, however, have not been received to warrant the publication of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watehtower</span><span class="font2"> In Arabic.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Forms Provided by Society</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each company and pioneer will be sent a supply of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription slips and Subscription Record sheets. The proper use of these forms will greatly aid us in promptly getting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> to new subscribers. When you need more of these forms, order them at once. They will be sent without charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Subscription Slips</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The secretary, or an assistant selected by him, is to carefully check each subscription slip turned in by the publishers. See that the complete name and address of the subscriber is plainly written. If the address appears to be incomplete, or is not legible, the secretary should see the publisher who turned it in and have it made out right. The name of the company should be written or stamped on each slip under the space marked “Sent in by”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Subscription Record Sheets</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Subscription Record sheets provide a convenient means of keeping a record of the subscriptions sent in, both for the Society and for the companies, so that if an error</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Every company should have an extra supply of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">magazine the same as they had of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> during the campaign last spring. The Society makes a special offer on English </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">distributors’ copies of five copies to one address for a period of a year for $3.00. For each additional copy over five, add 60c a year. For this campaign the Society will accept six-month subscriptions on this basis, making It 30c for six months, per copy, If five or more copies to one address are ordered. We suggest that all companies begin their subscription with January 1, and recommend that the subscription be for a year rather than six months, as you will need extra copies not only for back-call work In this campaign, but also for newly interested coming to your </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The company publishers should be able to get their sample </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font2"> for 3c, for field service. However, whenever copies are required for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study, either by publishers or by strangers, they should be charged 5c a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Distributors’ copies subscriptions will be charged to the company account if desired, but a partial remittance, at least, should be made with the order, and the balance paid monthly until the charge is liquidated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Where there are large foreign-speaking populations, such as Italian or Polish, you should have samoccurs a quick check-up can be made. These sheets are to be made out in duplicate. The original sheet is to be sent to the Society with the subscription slips and remittance to cover, and the duplicate sheet Is to be kept on file for your company records. All the names and addresses on the Subscription Record sheet should correspond exactly with those on the subscription slips, and should be printed or written plainly. So far as possible, the subscriptions should be grouped together, all </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions together, all </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions together, all six-month subscriptions together, and all foreign subscriptions together. The foreign subscriptions should be grouped last, and the language should be clearly marked, both on the subscription slips and on the Subscription Record sheets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When a company or pioneer sends in three or more subscriptions at one time, a record sheet should be filled out. If less than three, they should be noted In the accompanying letter. Do not cut up a Subscription Record sheet to send in three or fewer subscriptions. These sheets are to be sent in whole. It is important that the name of the company appear on each subscription slip sent in by companies. Slips sent in by pioneers should be signed by the pioneer. Confusion will be avoided if pioneer subscriptions are not listed on the same sheet with company publisher subscriptions. They should be recorded on a separate sheet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">During the four-month campaign the publishers will deduct 25c from the amount shown above for a year’s subscription and turn in the balance. The 25c, of course, is to cover the cost of the bound book and booklet given away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The rates to pioneers will remain the same as heretofore. Each pioneer will be supplied with five copies of each Issue in English for samples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So that a tremendous distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> can be made, a special rate is being made to the companies, of 80c a hundred, and a special rate to pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It will save much time and work in the office if the subscription slips are enclosed in the same order as they are listed on the sheet. All subscriptions sent to the Society should be accompanied by a remittance. During the four-month campaign the company publishers will deduct 25c from the regular one-year subscription price to cover the cost of the bound book given away. This applies only to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions obtained through the special offer. On other subscriptions the full amount will be turned in and transmitted to the Society with the Subscription Record sheets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before mailing, check to see that the following are enclosed In the envelope: (1) the Subscription Record sheet with all the names and addresses listed; (2) subscription slips to correspond with the Subscription Record sheets; and (3) money order to cover the total amount of the subscriptions. Subscriptions should be mailed in at least once a week, and oftener if you get more than one sheet full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers Must Co-operate</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order for the secretary to perform his work properly, It is necessary that each publisher turn in his subscription slips correctly made out In every detail. When you take a subscription, get the person’s complete name and address; and to be sure you have it correct, have the subscriber check over the slip personally. Make out these slips in duplicate, leaving with the subscriber the carbon copy, or a copy identical with the one you turn in. This slip, signed by you, constitutes the subscriber’s receipt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With each </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription obtained on this special offer you will leave with the party a sample copy of the current </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> booklet, and one bound book. Before leaving the subscriber state to him that his first issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> will come in two or three weeks. In a few words tell him about the worldwide campaign, so that he may understand that a tremendous number of subscriptions are coming in to the office and that therefore a short delay should cause him no concern. Please do not tell subscribers that they will receive copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> “next week”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If a person wants his subscription to begin with any particular issue, mark on the subscription slip coming in to the Brooklyn office, “Begin with issue dated _______________If your</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">slip is not marked, we will start the subscription with the current issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each publisher is to turn in his subscription slips, with the proper remittance, to the secretary at the first available opportunity. For each subscription slip the publisher will also make out a Back Call slip, properly filled out and signed. The publisher taking the subscription will continue back-calling on the party as the interest warrants. If assistance Is required for Model Study chairman, see the back call servant. Turn in the Back Call slip in the usual way. Note the territory number on the Back Call slip, so this will not have to be looked up by the back call servant.</span></p>

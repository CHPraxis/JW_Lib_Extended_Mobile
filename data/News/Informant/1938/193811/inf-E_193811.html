<p><span class="font2">Jehovah has revealed to his ‘faithful and true’ witnesses, in the publications </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> 1, 2, and 3, his glorious universal organization; also the wicked and cruel organization of Satan, and his (Jehovah’s) purpose soon to utterly annihilate Satan and all his religious cohorts, that all people who love righteousness may know that Jehovah is the only true and almighty God. Therein is disclosed also the grave responsibility of the anointed and their companions of now widely warning the people of this impending destruction, and the urgent necessity that the people of good will ride in the chariot of the Greater Jehu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By the most gracious provision of the Lord, we are privileged to offer these three books on a contribution of only 35c, thus bringing this message well within the reach of all people who love righteousness. Also, during December, if you have no </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font2"> you may offer </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 25c, dropping to Womwiy alone on a 5c contribution if they do not take books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Necessarily now the obligation is laid upon all the anointed and their companions to bring this unusual offer to the attention of as many people as possible throughout the 31 days of December. Each company should set as Its goal the distribution of all the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> books in stock and as many </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font2"> as possible. Make it at least one set of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> per publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer Most Seasonable</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This wonderful offer comes at the most appropriate time of the year. It is during December that the people are “ ‘Christmas’-shopping-con-scious,” so called—they are on the lookout for the best bargains that they can get as presents for their friends and for themselves. This false sense of ‘good will toward men’, which has been foisted upon them by the religionists, can be used to their advantage by bringing to their notice an offer that they cannot duplicate elsewhere. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, </span><span class="font2">Books 1, 2, and 3, on a contribution of 35c cannot be beat!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Own Stock</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Most of the companies have a plentiful supply of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, Preparation,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning;</span><span class="font2"> so there will be little need of companies’ ordering for this campaign, except </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication to</span><span class="font2"> make complete sets. The stockkeeper should arrange to have an exact count of this literature on hand as of Sunday, November 13, and post this information so that ail publishers may know what</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">is to be put out. This information is to be kept up from week to week until the campaign is over. The company servant should see to it, by the time of the last service meeting of November, that all the publishers have on hand at least one or two sets of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font2"> some </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation, </span><span class="font2">and a good supply of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning </span><span class="font2">booklet. All should be fully armed to start this campaign December 1 and place all of them by December 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers and Auxiliaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers and auxiliaries located in company territory should arrange to draw on the company stock of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, Preparation,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">only. The company servant is hereby authorized (during this campaign only) to transfer to pioneers and auxiliaries as much of this stock as they can use, on credit, on their word that their account is in good condition. At the end of December, that proper adjustment may be made on the different accounts, the company servant is to send in a statement signed by himself and the pioneer or auxiliary showing the literature so transferred. This one notice, covering literature turned over to each individual, will be all that will be necessary to send in to this office. It only causes confusion if both parties notify this office of the transfer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Isolated Pioneers and Auxiliaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers and auxiliaries not located in company territory, as well as those companies that have but a limited supply of this campaign literature, should send in their orders at once to Brooklyn for whatever </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, Preparation</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font2"> are required. We will promptly arrange to fill your order from our own, or, if possible, from some nearby company stock. Brethren whose</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">accounts are in poor condition should accompany their order with remittance to cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Territory to Be Worked</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During December the brethren should return to their urban territory, to the large towns and cities. The territory servant should immediately line up and assign such territory as can be best witnessed to in cold and inclement weather. The purpose should be to aid the publishers in calling on as many people as possible during the winter months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Additionally, the back call servant should arrange for the publishers to call on all the interested ones on his list with this special </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> offer, not only that they can take advantage of this opportunity for themselves, but that they can also be encouraged to get a set for their friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Carry Your Phonographs</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Introduce the phonograph as quickly as you can. Run records &quot;Relief” and “Resolution”, P-151, P-152. Briefly present the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> offer, pointing out the need of studying them at this crucial time. If they cannot take these books, endeavor to leave </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font2"> at least. Those brethren who because of infirmity or for other reason cannot carry along sets of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font2">should stress </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 25c or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font2"> alone on a contribution of 5c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Where there is interest manifested, arrange for a back call for the “Warning” and “Violence” series. Use every means at your command to aid the interested people in recognizing that Jehovah is supreme and that their safety lies in aligning themselves under his organization. The sound servant should see that all phonographs are in working condition and in use and that the brethren have record P-151, P-152.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">December Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the December report card, in the column “Books” Is to be shown the total number of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font2"> (as well as any other books) that have been placed during that month. In addition, the companies and auxiliaries are to show at the bottom of their December report card the number of complete sets of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> placed, by stat-</span></p>

All companies and auxiliaries giving this information will receive a credit on their account of 25c and 13c a set respectively. If this information is not on the December report, it will be assumed that the company or auxiliary so reporting is desirous of helping the Society to bear the burden of this special reduction. As the cost to pioneers is already very low, no credit will be given on sets placed at this special rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Warriors All</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This “Faithful and True” period should see all the soldiers of the Kingdom wielding the sword of the spirit to the honor and praise of Jehovah and his King, Christ Jesus, and to the continued perplexity and pain of the religionists and their Godless allies. This period should start us well on our way toward our goal of 35,000 publishers as well as clear the decks for the great battle to be fought during the world-wide campaign of January-April.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Therefore we will continue throughout the month of November to offer the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font2"> booklet to the people on a contribution of 5c, and leave the booklet in quantity of 6 on a 25e, 13 on a 50c, or 26 on a $1.00 contribution, with those who show</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“Warning” is not just the title of another booklet; the booklet contains an ultimatum from the Lord to the Fascist-religious totalitarian crowd and an invitation to those of good will to serve God and Christ the King and live. The obligation is laid upon Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, the Jonadabs, to deliver this message—an obligation that cannot be side-stepped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Continue to use the new record, “Relief,” “Resolution,” P-151, P-152, in the regular house-to-house witness, which will materially aid you in arranging for studies in the homes of the interested ones. At these back calls, use the “Warning” and “Violence” series of records.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The speech “Fascism ob Freedom”, by Brother Rutherford on Sunday, October 2, at Mecca Temple, was an event that you had to be actually in the audience in order to appreciate. Brother Rutherford was at his best. His masterly delivery of one barrage of irrefutable evidence after another against the bulwark of the Devil’s Hierarchy Fascistlc com-! bination was thrilling. The audience was held spellbound throughout.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Over an hour before the meeting commenced the main auditorium, with its three massive balconies, was filled to overflowing. Then the large auditorium downstairs, used for an overflow, was filled In a very short time. Long before the meeting started all the halls, including the hall for the overflow meeting, staircases and every available space where a person might stand, were filled up and crowds were being turned away. This was beyond the comprehension of the Mecca Temple employees, who told us before the meeting that it was useless to get an overflow hall, as they had never filled the main auditorium in the (Continued </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">on page</span><span class="font2"> 2, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">column</span><span class="font2"> 4)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The month of October ushers in another year of service in the Kingdom for Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, the Jonadabs, who recognize Jehovah as supreme and delight to acknowledge his new Theocratic Government, under Christ, and place ourselves under its laws. We rejoice to have had a share during the past year in heralding the Kingdom tidings, and confidently look forward to a year of Increased privileges of serving Jehovah, now that the time has arrived for a better and more completely harmonious organization for the service of the Lord, He having made bls approved servants peace and righteousness, and who are in complete harmony and united in action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The two Important messages from London during the recent world-wide convention and the one from New York city on October 2 have renewed within the Lord’s people, both anointed and Jonadabs, a determination to let nothing separate us from the love of God and participation in his service. With confidence, knowing that the battle is Jehovah’s and the victory certain, let us fearlessly face the enemy, alert and subject to the commands of God’s great Field Marshal, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The world-wide convention witnessed many newly interested Jonadabs taking a firm stand for Jehovah and his righteous kingdom, engaging for the first time in the actual field service, joyfully saying to those with a hearing ear: “Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The August </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> stated: “In the United States alone [during June] there were 31,110 publishers in the field—a new peak—showing the continued increase of the multitude.” In view of the advent of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government, with many new ones now appreciating the privilege of service as sub-</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font2"> a 64-page booklet, will contain the lecture by that title as well as “Fill the Earth”, the speech delivered by Brother Rutherford at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday, September 10. In the latter speech it is pointed out that more information about Jehovah’s mandate to righteous creatures to fill the earth is supplied in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> It is essential, then, for the lovers of righteousness who read this booklet to have access to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> Therefore the offer will include the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine. In fact, it will be a special offer: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Riches,</span><span class="font2"> or any other bound book written by Judge Rutherford, and the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font2"> will be left with the people free when they subscribe for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> for a year. Only $1.00 in the U.S.A., or $1.50 in foreign countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies, pioneers and auxiliaries, by now, have thousands of names in their files. All of these persons will be called on with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> one of the bound books and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts.</span><span class="font2"> It is hoped that during these four months 100,000 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-</span><span class="font2">jeets thereof, the peak of publishers reached in June will be far surpassed, and so a new quota is set for the fiscal year 1939, namely, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PUBLISHERS. </span><span class="font2">This will call for wide-awake action on the part of every true lover of righteousness In the Lord’s army of witnesses. Each publisher will determine to be consistent in service </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(turning in service reports regularly and promptly)</span><span class="font2"> and also to place the matter of now being servants of Almighty God in its proper light before the interested ones at back calls and at study and service meetings. This is a responsibility on all Kingdom publishers, and especially company, zone and regional servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies should keep a close check on the matter of increase in publishers. Each company should have an up-to-date list of all company publishers on file. All associated with the company organization and not now publishers should be encouraged to have a share in this ‘strange work’ of the Lord now progressing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the strength and by the favor of Jehovah of Hosts, we will reach and exceed the new quota of thibty-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIVE THOUSAND PUBLISHERS !</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Organization Big Help</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Effective October 1 the companies of the Lord’s people were reorganized under Jehovah’s Theocratic Government in full harmony with the Scriptural requirements. The regional and zone servants are now going from company to company and in every way possible assisting the reorganization so that a more efficient and greater witness may be accomplished. Some companies are wondering why on October 1 the zone servant did not call on them. He will within the next few months. In due course every company will be notified of the date of the zone servant’s arrival, and at which time he will go into all details relative to the organization instructions. Mean</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tower</span><span class="font2"> will be obtained, one million bound books distributed, and twelve million </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font2"> this being the world-wide quota. Wherever people do not subscribe for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> there we will leave with them the bound book and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> on contribution of a quarter. In every home where the people are interested and will read, they should be left a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> on contribution of 5c or less, or even free if they are unable to contribute. Such contributions will make it possible to print more. This message must go far and wide. Where persons are really desirous of reading but their circumstances will not permit them to make even the small contribution of a penny, leave </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> with them and arrange for a back call with the records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During this world-wide campaign with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> and a bound book, records will play a very important part, because many back calls will have to be made. It is therefore essential that every company have on hand a good supply of records, particularly the ones announced in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font2">which records are “Face the Facts”, “Fill the Earth,” and “Fascism or Freedom”. Everyone in the theocratic organization will appreciate the real need of preparing for this, the greatest of all campaigns, and by the Lord’s grace it will equal the last previous campaign of this kind and surpass it. It will mean real work, hard work, and a progressive fight, and therefore we announce at this early date a few of the points relative to the campaign. Your next </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> will carry all the details. In the meantime we will add to all company orders a consignment of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts.</span><span class="font2"> Pioneers and auxiliaries must order their supply.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Are You Properly Prepared with Sound Equipment?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">In order to properly carry on the Kingdom field service each publisher should have a phonograph. We are now prepared to fill all orders for these as they are sent in. Find out what the company requirements are, how many more can be used, and send in your orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We can also ship No. 4 sound equipment as soon as ordered. The cost is $140 to all publishers; and provision is made, for those not able to pay this all at once, for sending in a $50 down payment, and a year is allowed In which to pay it out. Get yours now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you wish your wet-battery PTM converted into a No. 3 sound-car equipment, this can be done for $80, with $10 additional if you desire microphone. This also may be obtained on time, with $40 down payment and the balance in a year. The Society will recondition your present PTM machine and make it like new, as well as make your turntable two-speed. The sound equipment is doing a wonderful work. Get some, and then see that it Is put to plenty of use.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Back Calls to Be Made by Every Publisher</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">The Importance of back calls cannot be overstressed. It is at back calls that the newly Interested are brought together and fed with the provisions the Lord has made for them, the Kingdom message in printed and recorded form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Never before was the Lord’s table so bountifully supplied with provisions as right now. We have all the rich food recorded and printed in the past. In addition, we have the new recordings containing “Face the Facts”, “Fill the Earth,” and “Fascism or Freedom”, all containing a vital message of judgment, warning and life for the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A letter was sent with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> describing the Society’s arrangement for supplying these and other records at a much reduced rate up until December 31 of this year. Each one should get busy Immediately. Check up on your needs and put through your order, that you may be thoroughly equipped to carry out this commission from the Lord. This letter was headed “Turn On the Heat”. This is no time for tranquil complacency ; this is a time for war. Let everyone be on the alert always to take advantage of every opportunity for arranging for a back call. In addition, use the recordings in your own Kingdom hall, schoolhouses, abandoned churches, club rooms, private homes, auditoriums, on your PTM, and on sound cars. Loan them to interested people. In short, take advantage of every opportunity to use them to the glory of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let us make the coming fall and winter the greatest period of back-calling we have ever had to date.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">As you know, the lecture was also broadcast by more than 60 radio stations. Many of you, undoubtedly, heard it. We hope that everyone who listened in complied with Brother Rutherford’s request and wrote a letter to the radio station, commending those who properly broadcast the lecture and telling those who cut it off what you thought of their unjust, un-American and cowardly procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There were approximately 1,400 requests from interested parties at the meeting for copies of the speech, and thousands more have come in by mall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That thrilling speech that held the audience in Mecca Temple spellbound will, undoubtedly, have the same effect upon the people for whom you play it in their homes and in your auditoriums. Order your supply of this lecture, and make good use of it.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Reports</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">A year’s supply of report cards is being sent to all pioneers, auxiliaries and companies, accompanied with detailed instructions as to how they are to be made out. Special care is to be taken to see that prompt and complete reports are submitted at the end of each month. It will greatly aid this office if you will comply with these simple Instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies should keep an accurate record of all publishers in their territory, as well as a list of all the interested ones. Everyone should be encouraged to engage in the witness work at least once every month, with regular publishers maintaining an average of at least 15 hours a month.</span></p>

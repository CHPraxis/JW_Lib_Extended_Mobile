<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Three Books on Contribution of 35c</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Your Back-Calls Lined Up?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Do You Have Your 12 Books?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">A favorite text for this time of the year has always been, “Thou crownest the year with thy goodness” (Psalm 65:11), and certainly all of Jehovah’s people can testify to the fact that the past year has been one overflowing with blessings from Jehovah in the marvelous way He has led His people by revealing to them His purposes and by furnishing them the necessary instructions through His Theocratic Organization. And the privilege of engaging in the “War of Vindication” Period just ending has been a fitting climax to a full year of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the time this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> is received, all preparations should have been completed for making the month of January the biggest month for bound books in the history of this organization and all the publishers set for January 1 to “start the ball rolling”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has set aside all the “even” months of the year as campaign months and designated these as Testimony Periods. As January comes in between two testimony periods, it will be interesting to see what the publishers will do during an “odd” month and how much the results will surpass those of the previous similar book campaign during the “Faithful and True” Testimony Period, in December, 1938. The results will, no doubt, show that there are no “off” months with Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All to Have a Share</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The peak of company publishers so far reported, in October, 1939, by no means represents the total number of publishers in the United States, as quite a number of the ‘spasmodic’ publishers failed to report during that month and, as indicated elsewhere in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font3">November took a slight drop in publishers. If we “come back” this year as we did last, when there was an increase of over 5,000 publishers between November and January, we shall be quite near our quota of 50,000 publishers for the fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was suggested in the December </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> that there should be no excuse for any of the brethren for not having a share in this special campaign, as even the elderly ones can take along a bound book and a catalog and use both to demonstrate the special offer, later delivering the books, or having someone else deliver them. Those who have been waiting for “opportunity to knock at their doors” will find this opportunity during January, as little need be said to place three bound books on such an exceptionally low contribution as thirty-five cents, although those who can point out the various special features of the books may be able to leave a larger number of bound books with an individual. It is suggested that the new publishers can be further encouraged by permitting them to call on those who have previously taken literature or shown interest and whose names are in the back-call files of the company. Many of these people will wish to avail themselves of this special offer. The young folks, many of whom have previously engaged only in information marches, or in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font3"> and other booklet distribution, should be encouraged to have a share in this special distribution of bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We should make a special effort during this campaign to arrange for back-calls on those who obtain the combinations from us. While we will endeavor to place as many bound books as possible, we should not lose sight of the fact that our primary work is to inform the people about the Kingdom and its provisions ; and if we can be assured of their benefiting from the information contained in the books, we shall feel that our work was worth while. The only way we can be sure is by calling back and finding out. If we leave a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> folder at the time, arrangements may be made to return and let them hear the “Government and Peace” lecture, following the outline given in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font3"> No. 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are hundreds of names, in your back-call files, too, of persons that will need these books; so don’t forget them. January should be a banner back-call month. Maybe we can reach the average of 4 back-calls per publisher in January.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Delivering Orders</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the special bound-book campaign extends only throughout the month of January, and the company must show on its January report card the number of combinations placed, in order to get the rebate, there will be no objection to the publishers’ delivering orders on February 1 and reporting these as placed during January. This will enable some of the publishers to leave books with people who would not be able to take the books until “pay day”. As soon after the first of February as possible, all publishers should have their reports in, so that the company may send in its complete report. In view of the fact that when they turn in their report slips the company will reimburse the publishers for all combinations placed, the company will be anxious to get its report in promptly so necessary rebate on the company account may be allowed it by the Society. This will appear on your statement.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Magazine Route?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">Obtain a Set of Books for Your Personal Use</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">AU newly interested brethren who have obtained and studied possibly only the newer books will wish to obtain for their own use a complete set of the books. This will be a good opportunity for their doing so. This privilege extends, of course, to any of the brethren. You will notice that the new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font3"> booklet No. 2 calls for paragraphs to be read from the various books in support of the information being considered, and so it will be necessary for every publisher to be equipped with a complete set of books in order to carry on model studies, and every publisher</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> SHOULD BE CONDUCTING MODEL STUDIES.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Properly Equipped</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the way the orders have been coming in from pioneers and companies, there will be a real witness given to the praise of Jehovah’s name during the month. If all the company servants look after the companies’ interests there should be sufficient books on hand, from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Harp </span><span class="font3">to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font3"> so that each company publisher will have at least 12 bound books for his use during the campaign, and many of the publishers will already have obtained their quota from the stockroom. (Those companies that have on hand some of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> book will make definite arrangements to see that every one of these is placed during the month.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each study group will be all set to thoroughly cover its assignment during the month, giving special attention to the back-call names turned over to the study conductor by the back-call servant. The study conductor and other regular publishers in the group will arrange to take with them the non-publlshers and show them how to “publish”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those not associated with a study group will be ready to give their individual home territory a good coverage, having in mind those in the territory who have previously taken literature and giving these the privilege of obtaining the rest of the set at three books on 35c contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Additionally, tlie company will have arranged for some group witnessing parties in territory not assigned to individuals or study groups, for several times during the month at least, the first day of the campaign, January 1, being a very good day for that purpose, as practically all in the company can be mustered out that day. This will also be an encouragement to the new ones to work with a large group of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the campaign we do not wish to ignore the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> book, as many showing exceptional interest will want this book and we should be prepared to offer it, as W’ell as the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace.</span><span class="font3"> With every combination or single book placement, be sure that there is left a bookmark, showing where your meetings are held. These bookmarks have already been the means of bringing many people to the regular studies, and, as a result, some of these are now publishers. Where no books at all can be left, a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> folder, properly stamped -with address of your headquarters, should be left. The phonograph should be put to extensive use during this campaign. In addition to the “Snare and Backet” record, there are a number of other of the records which mention the publications of the Society and which may be used during this January special campaign to aid in placing the books with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We look to the January campaign with joy, appreciating the wonderful blessings the Theocracy has in store for the people of good will in the bound books to be distributed.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Testimony Card Will Help</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">It is recognized that throughout certain parts of the United States it is not possible during the extreme winter weather to use the phonograph door-to-door setup method extensively. Therefore, during February publishers in such territory should concentrate on the Testimony Card method of introducing the Kingdom message. Use this as a means toward opening the way for the phonograph to be run in the home; and even in cases where you cannot get in you will find many instances where the people will readily take the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> book on reading the Testimony Card. In sections where there really is no “winter” and in apartment houses, of course, the phonograph door-to-door setup should be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Continue to use the “Snare and Racket” record. This will mean that you will have to take along some of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> book. Be sure always to leave a bookmark with each person who takes </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> or any other bound book. While you are out in the field be prepared at all times to fully serve the people. Keep in mind that the King’s business is the most important and is worthy of your best efforts.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Consideration Given to January’s Calendar Pad Text</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">The new Calendar opens the calendar year 1940 with a very timely suggestion for January, during which much time might comfortably be spent at home because of cold and inclement weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Consider: “My Hours in the Field,” quoting Ephesians 5:15,16: “Walk ... as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.” Or, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font2"> renders it: “Buying out for yourselves the opportunity, because the days are evil.” (See also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Dlaglott.)</span><span class="font2"> The Lord’s people are all consecrated to him; consequently their time belongs to the Lord. The Devil and his world would monopolize most or all of their time and try to crowd out their service of the Lord. Jesus warned that at the end of the world His followers should guard against being overcharged with the cares of this world, which would encroach upon their time and attention and strength. (Luke 21:34-36) Hence they must, at the cost of self-pleasing and gratification, redeem or buy out the time and thereby ‘secure’ for themselves the opportunity to serve the Lord actively as commanded by him. Otherwise, time and the opportunity that time offers will be lost so far as your part in connection with Jehovah’s “strange work” is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Specifically, bow is time lost? The following are a few suggestions showing where time can be redeemed. Let each one examine himself, and then take steps to guard against irredeemable loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Much time is lost to the Devil and his organization by consecrated persons in devoting unnecessary time, strength and thought to getting promotion, approval and additional wealth from some branch of Satan’s organization, striving for that which perisheth and will pass away. Others devote unnecessary time and strength striving to gain health and strength, apparently on the assumption that man shall live by bread alone. This is unscriptural and dangerous. It gets creatures to worshiping themselves, considering themselves and forgetting the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Others waste consecrated time in catering to the whims and selfish desires of relatives, friends and others. Still others, to the gratification of their own selfish desires when there is opportunity for field service, seek recreation, movies, drama, worldly reading, such as novels, magazines, and things of this nature. We could go on indefinitely and recount time that is lost by consecrated persons, which time is the property of the Lord and belongs to him. All of this time is redeemable and must</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers and the Bound-Book Campaign</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">The December </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> called attention to what promises to be the greatest bound-book campaign to date. Pioneers everywhere are determined that they will not be caught again as they were during the Vindication campaign last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The December </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> also suggests a general quota of one combination of three bound books a day for each pioneer. Many of the pioneers, of course, know that they will place many more than that, and should therefore order proportionately. All pioneers should place at least one combination a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers will send their orders direct to the Society. Do not try to get your literature from the local be bought out and properly redeemed and used to the glory of the Lord if we are going to be pleasing to him ; and if this time is properly redeemed and devoted to the Lord, many who now find it difficult to attain their 60-hour quota will do so without any difficulty at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is a serious matter. It is an individual matter. Each and every one, individually, should be critical of himself and not of others and check carefully on himself and see that the time that belongs to the Lord Is redeemed and utilized for its proper purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">November Shows Splendid Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How are you progressing, as individuals and as a company, with the quota suggested by the Society? Do you have the chart properly prepared? and what does it show? Let each company and each individual compare their results with the results of all companies in the United States as shown in the following chart. You will note that the month of November is added. The increase in number of publishers and of hours per publisher in the field for the month of November this year over November last year Is very gratifying. The brethren do realize the seriousness of the responsibility resting upon them. There was a slight drop in November under October this year of about 1,300 publishers. This should not be. There doesn’t seem to be any good reason why publishers • who were able to' get out in October should not have been able to get out in November this year, with a few exceptions of sickness and other conditions beyond the control of the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The hours in the field dropped from an average of 19.1 in October to 15.4 in November, about 3} hours. Some of this, of course, can be accounted for in the fact that October had five week-ends and a number of days from September carried over from last year. We should be doing better, however, than 15.4; but the splendid increase shown when compared with last year, when we averaged only 10.9 hours in the field, is, of course, very encouraging. What is January going to be? Your December is gone; what was it in average number of hours? Let each company, and each individual check on this matter. Watch for the figures in the next </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> and see how your figures compare with them.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>There Is Plenty of Territory for Full-Time Service</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">The most blessed condition of any of the Lord’s people amidst this crooked and perverse generation is one in which the servant of God can devote all his time and energies toward furthering the Kingdom interests. Such, like the apostle Paul, have their minds firmly set on “this one thing”, and their peace and joy know no bounds. They rely entirely on the Lord, and he pours out his blessings on them without measure and without sorrow. Why not be a full-time, pioneer publisher by spring and be completely engaged in Kingdom interests. Begin planning and saving now. This is the time to write in and find out where is the most suitable territory for you. There is much territory open for pioneers; particularly in large cities is there a crying demand for pioneers. Many companies are finding they cannot adequately take care of the interest in their territories and they need pioneers to assist them. Why not be of assistance to these companies, working together with them in caring for the people of good will?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While in the last year there has been a tremendous increase in the number of company publishers, the number in the ranks of the pioneers has been more or less at a standstill.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1940 “Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Calendar Also Ready</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">Who are Jehovah’s witnesses? What is the organization? and how may one become associated with it? What are the results showing that those associated with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society are Jehovah’s witnesses? These pertinent questions and many others are thoroughly answered in the 1940 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font2"> for the benefit of those of good will. Everyone associated with the organization will desire a copy of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font2"> so he can read of last year’s activities of Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers, the greatest year in the history of the Society. Each will likewise require the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font2"> for the daily texts and comments to be used throughout the year. There are many people upon whom we are making back-calls who are intensely interested in the Kingdom work but who have not as yet attended the headquarters’ meetings, and these should be made acquainted with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font2"> and urged' to obtain one.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Model Study</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> No. 2</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font2"> No. 2 booklet is the latest provision of the Lord in aiding his organization to “feed” the many hungry souls. Each company and pioneer should get a good supply of these booklets, so as to properly care for the increased interest. They work and to see their responsibility. This campaign will undoubtedly open up a wide field of new interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers in company territory will co-operate fully with the company organization by reporting new interest to the back-call servant and regularly turning in back-call follow-up slips on each back-call made and model study held, and in all other details co-operate closely in developing the new interest and aiding them to see the Lord’s organization and take a stand on the Lord’s side. The yearly fiscal reports for the past three years show we had the following average numbers of pioneers and of company publishers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Company-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In- &nbsp;Pub-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Year Pioneers crease Ushers Increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1937 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,838 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18,856</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The October report of this fiscal year showed 42,436 company publishers and only 2,390 pioneers. If the pioneers had increased at the same rate as the companies we would now have approximately 4,000 pioneers in the field. In 1937 we had 1,800 pioneers and 18,000 company publishers. We expect by Memorial time, in March, to have 50,000 publishers, and at that same proportional rate of increase there should be approximately 5,000 pioneers! Prayerfully consider, brethren, this full-time service. We feel confident that many today who are enjoying only part-time service will find out they can put in their whole time in the King’s cause. Recall to mind the words of Jesus, namely, &quot;But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Why not write for Pioneer information and be ready for full-time service by spring?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some of these people will desire several copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“My heabt shall bejoice in thy salvation”</span><span class="font2"> is a text we shall have occasion to use a great deal throughout the year. This year text is fitly illustrated on the 1940 Calendar by the wreck of the Devil’s organization in Armageddon and the salvation of those who have put their trust in the Lord. Neither the picture on the Calendar nor the Calendar pads give any honor to men or man-made holidays, but all honor is given to Jehovah. There should be a Calendar in the home of every one of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Find out right away how many are required for the needs of the company, and the company servant can send in the order, so you can have the use of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font2"> as quickly as possible. A cash remittance should accompany the order, 50 cents per </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font2"> and 25 cents per Calendar (in quantities of five or more Calendars to same address, 20c each).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">are 5c a copy to everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One big feature of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study </span><span class="font2">No. 2 is that a complete lecture can be run and thoroughly covered in three or four evenings. In this manner more lecture series can be run for the newly interested, yet each lecture is fully discussed. Companies holding this study at their Kingdom hall have had a great increase in the number of publishers attending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Note that considerable reference is made to the other publications, notably the bound books. Each publisher should have for his own use all of these publications and be familiar with the references made from each book. The company should also keep in stock a good quantity of these books, for the use of new publishers and for the people with whom the model study is conducted, as well as for distribution in the regular field service. There will always be a demand and need for all these books.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We are happy to announce that during the “Salvation” Testimony Period, which will be for the entire month of February, we will very appropriately stress the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> and its companion booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of 25c. Where the people cannot hike this combination, then offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font3"> witli two other booklets on a contribution of 10c; and where they are unable to contribute e\en that little and will read a booklet, leave </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font3"> with them for a few pennies or free. Also, with each person called upon leave a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kinydom</span><span class="font0"> Vc;r&lt; </span><span class="font3">or the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font3">fol (It r.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the release of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font3">book to the public, just won months ago, tile Society has already printed 1,750.000 copies of this thrilling and instructive book. We shall soon start printing on the 2,000,000 edition, the demand for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> book being so tremendous. This is indeed good news; for it is another manifestation from tin- Lord that this is the acceptable time to comfort those that cry and sigh because of the abominations they see committed throughout all of “Christendom&quot;. It is also a eomincing evidence that the army of locusts is very much on</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Information That Will Aid the Company and Office</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers should always remit for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> new and renewal subscriptions, whether the subscriptions are for six months or for a longer period. Pioneers are to send in $1.00 with all renewal subscript ions, as there is no special rate on renewals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers and company servants should give their full name and address at the upper right-hand corner of each letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Company servants living outside of the town by which the company is known should always show the name of the company at the head of each letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The pioneers who are also serving as company servants should definitely state on each order submitted whether it is a pioneer or a company order, whether remittance is for the company or on pioneer account, etc. Pioneers serving in such capacity should always send in two change of address notices: one on the pioneer Change of Address slip and another on a sheet of paper, stating on the latter that such change is for address as company servant. Also, correspondence pertaining to companies should be on a sheet separate from pioneer mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers are to promptly notify this office of each change of address, on the regular<sup>-</sup> Change of Address slips. Before mailing in the slip, be sure that all the information called for, including your complete new address, is plainly and correctly written out. A separate Change of Address slip is to be made out by every pioneer, whether -witnessing alone, in pairs, or in groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The cost of all self-covered booklets is the same, and 1ms been since June 1. Also, all </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font3"> booklets, English and foreign, are five cents a copy. the increase and is doing a thorough job of “eating up the varnish”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">50,000 Publishers???</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The steady influx in the number of Jonadabs taking part in the witness work is very encouraging to behold. The unbounded joy and enthusiasm with -which they take hold of the work is indeed thrilling, and it is no wonder that others of like spirit are joining the ranks. As these people of good will come to a reasonable understanding of the truth they are very glad to make known the Kingdom message to others. In your service meetings and in till study meetings point out this increase and show the need and privilege of each one's doing something to further the interests of the Kingdom. Stress regularity in the service. The brethren should get out in the service regularly, In the field service or in the back-call work, at the very least once each month If the brethren who have ever gone out in the field service in the past engage in the witness work during February, with the steady influx of new publishers. we should easily have 5(1,0011 publishers. Let each company strive during February to get out all its available publishers, if only for a few' hours during the month. It is to the best possible interest of the individual and the company organization to know that each publisher witnesses regularly each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers and companies are not to transfer literature lo one another. Whenever it does become necessary to transfer stock, authorization is first to be obtained from the Society before such transaction is put through. Zone servants, as representatives of the Society, may authorize the transferring of stock in line with specific instructions from the Society relating to excessive stock in their zone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Company servants are to mail to the Society, and to their respective zone servant, at the end of each month, a report card covering the month’s activities. Many company servants fail to send in a report to tlie zone servant, and this has caused extra and unnecessary work at the ofiice. The report cards to the zone servant are to be mailed to his permanent address. Zone servants who have not advised all companies in their zone of their permanent address, please do so immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order that all study conductors may be familiar with what the Organization Instructions have to say about tlie proper conducting of studies, the company servant should arrange to supply all appointed study conductors with the information under &quot;Study Meetings”, first two paragraphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When a company servant notifies the office of his change of address he should definitely state that his address as company servant is also to be changed ; for otherwise a mere notice to change address will result only in change of address of his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> You will appreciate the necessity of doing this when you bear in mind that there are approximately 2.500 company servants and thousands of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> subscribers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Interest in the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many brethren during February will begin working territory that has already been gone over with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> book. When you meet persons who have the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font3">book, find out what progress they have made, and try to arrange for a back-call with the series of records or model study. Invite them to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> study nearest them. Get their name and address and call back on them, until they are attending the meetings regularly or have shown they are not Interested. To do this work properly, of course, one must work in the same assignment continually. This again emphasizes the need of publishers’ having individual territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At all rimes be on the alert to get the name and address of each person who shows interest in the Kingdom work. And when a publisher gets such names, he should himself call back on these people, and not leave this interesting and important work to others.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Those Handling Coupons Please Read Carefully</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">Companies and pioneers sending coupons to us should keep in mind the following information: Coupons are sent by us to the Colgate Palmolive Peet Co., in New Jersey, at intervals of from two to four weeks. Coupons that accumulate here during these intervals are all sent together in one shipment. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For this reason it is important that you do not put any orders, report cards, money orders, or anythin// else that needs immediate attention, in letters attached to packages of coupons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It takes from two to four weeks after we send a shipment of coupons away before we receive a check for them. If the check comes just after your monthly statement has been sent to you, the credit for the coupons you sent in will not appear until the next month’s statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To aid us in handling your coupons, please carry out the following instructions very carefully.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. Always semi a letter git lug the necessary information about the coupons. If there is nothing in the letter but information pertaining to tilt' coupons, this letter may be attached securely to the package of coupons. If in tin* letter there are other items requiring immediate attention. send the letter separate from the package.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. Slate the different kinds of coupons in the package, and give the total of each kind. Coupons do not all have the same value. &lt;&nbsp;tetagon, Kirkmen, Rumford, Luzianne and Ballard’s are all .S4.00 per thousand fnll-calue coupons. Health Club are only Sll.OO per thousand. Borden’s coupons have no cash value, and, if possible, should be redeemed in some coupon store in your neighborhood where you can receive merchandise for them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. Coupons should be carefully counted and tied together in bundles of 100 full-value coupons. Thu, 200 half-value coupons should be tied together to make a bundle of 100 full-value coupons. These bundles should be made up of coupons of the same brand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. Always state the pioneer or company account that is to be credited with the value of these coupons. Companies should be especially careful to give the name of the company that is to lie credited.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">has been a great aid to people of good will, and now it behooves every one of the Kingdom publishers to see that the message contained therein gets into the homes of all people who love righteousness. It is not always convenient for individuals to spend one dollar for a subscription at one time, or even fifty cents for six months, but at least everyone who loves righteousness and desires to know the truth can afford to spend five cents every other week for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and the same amount for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation. </span><span class="font3">Let every one of the publishers for the Kingdom now take hold of this new work of a wide distribution of the magazines published by the Society and meet regularly these people of good will by building up a route. This will show the individual interest you have in those people, and sooner or later they will see that there is only one place of safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your reports on the progress of this campaign will be of real interest to the Society. Company servants should take np this portion of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> with the company along with the Society’s letter of December 15 on the same subject, very shortly, and then place your subscription for distributors’ copies by February 1.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Special Work to Begin February 1</span></h5>
<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>New Arrangement Will Increase Number of</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Publish ers</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">In the past two years the Society has specially stressed the placing of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font3">magazines in the homes of the people of good will. Two years ago we had the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> campaign, which proved to the publishers that subscriptions can be obtained. Last year in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign results far exceeded those of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> campaign and again proved one thing: that magazines can be placed in the homes of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been found, as a result of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower's</span><span class="font3"> going into the homes regularly, thousands of persons now see that their chief responsibility, if they ever will obtain life everlasting upon the earth, is to be a publisher. The Lord has placed upon his people the commission of seeing that this gospel of the Kingdom is preached' and, according to the wider distribution of this Kingdom message, the greater is the influx of the great multitude. The magazine plays an important part in the dissemination of the Gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every effort should now be made by the publishers of the Kingdom to see to it that the people of good will have an opportunity to receive a knowledge of the truth, and this new campaign which begins with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> magazines will assist them to take a definite stand for the Kingdom. While the subscription lists for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> are very good and have increased tremendously during the past several years, hundreds of thousands more copies of these magazines should be distributed weekly; and one way that it can be done is by each company’s making the magazine a part of its weekly field activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wider Distribution Begins February</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the beginning of the “Salvation” Testimony Period this new work of a wider distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> will begin. Publishers of the Kingdom know the importance of the contents of these magazines, and therefore everyone should be convinced that hundreds of thousands more persons should be reading them regularly. There are three ways in which this wider distribution of the magazines can be accomplished:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. By obtaining individual subscriptions for the magazine for one year or for six months.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. By building up a route which each publisher will cover every week, one week with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and the next week with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. By the distribution of the magazines in business sections, railroad stations, bus terminals, and at busy intersections in the city.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The Kingdom interests can be greatly advanced by carrying on a wider distribution of these magazines in your own company territory. Every company publisher should take hold of this work with a zeal peculiar to the Lord's house. If twenty-five percent of all the publishers in the United States participated in the distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> by this new method of building up magazine routes, or by getting an assignment at some busy intersection for a few hours every Saturday or week-day evening, more than one hundred thousand additional copies of each of the magazines would be distributed of every printing. Before six months have elapsed every publisher of the Kingdom should be a magazine publisher placing at least five copies each week. By that is meant the magazine publisher will have developed a route in which he will distribute regularly a few of the magazines as soon as they are delivered to the company. While at all times we want to encourage individual subscriptions for the magazines, tills special work will be primarily the developing of a magazine route and distribution at busy parts of the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Organizing the Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On December 15 the Society mailed a letter addressed to all company publishers regarding the rates. Supplementing this letter the following is the outline of how the work will be carried on in each company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One person in the company who is anxious to see this work progress should be assigned the responsibility of seeing that all of the magazine work is properly handled. The details will probably be too much for the company servant to undertake, or the secretary. If they can handle it, then take on the responsibility; but in most large companies probably the advertising servant can take over all the details relative to magazines. The company servant should select one of the servants appointed by the Society, preferably the advertising servant, to look after this work, and such assistants as may be necessary as the work increases. Hereafter we will refer to the advertising servant as the one handling the magazine campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All persons who desire to participate in this work should register with the advertising servant as “magazine publisher” and inform him how many copies they will require of each issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> The order for the company should be placed in the name of the advertising servant, giving his address. The magazines will come to his home shortly after the magazine is published. It will then be the duty of this individual to see to it that all the “magazine publishers” registered with him receive their supply at the next meeting, so that they can make proper distribution to their routes prior to the date of issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many of the magazine publishers will continually increase the number required for their routes, because of finding new interest when making regular deliveries, and this information, of course, should be conveyed to the advertising servant, who will increase your supply accordingly. Other publishers who are working at the street corners will find that they can distribute 5, 10 or 15 every time they take up their position, and, knowing their needs, will so inform the advertising servant at least once each month. The advertising servant will, in turn, increase his magazine order with the Society, so that you have ample supply.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Magazine Route?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">A special magazine account will be opened in each company’s name where 10 or more copies of each issue are mailed regularly. Please see letter of December 15 for details on ordering and remitting on your Distributors’ copies account. Companies already having an order with the Society for distributors’ copies will receive a credit on their new account to the amount of the unexpired subscription. This applies to distributors’ copies of 10 or more mailed to one address. Companies wanting to change their quantity of 10 or more can do so beginning February 1, 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Increasing Publishers and Hours</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many of the young folks in the companies have been hoping something special for them would be arranged by the Society so that they might aid in the proclamation of the Kingdom to a greater extent. This is just the thing for young and old alike. Where a regular company publisher has an individual territory he can work up a definite route of people desiring either </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> each time it is published, and if desired the children can make these regular deliveries. Thus the children not only can have a share in taking care of the route but can build up their route by spending a half hour or an hour extra, when making deliveries, in calling on the people, showing them sample copies of the magazines and seeing if they can add their names to your regular deliveries. There are thousands of young folks in the companies who desire something to do, and here is a splendid opportunity afforded. Also Saturday afternoons and after school, many of these publishers can take their positions in downtown sections of the city, bus stations, and railroad terminals, and distribute the magazines to passersby. They can get a regular allotment each week and carry on this wider distribution of the magazines. This not only means more publishers in the field, but means more hours spent in witnessing for the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Everyone sharing in this magazine work should make out </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> regular Publisher’s Field Service Report every time he is out in the service. On the new form, copy of which is furnished with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> is provided a space where the magazine publisher will report the number of individual magazines placed. It does not make any difference whether </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower or Consolation;</span><span class="font3"> what the Society would like to know in this report is the number of individual magazines distributed due to this new work. The Society also requests that each company keep track of the new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions, that is, new subscriptions taken for a year or six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In your monthly report to the zone servant and Society, divide the space under the heading “New </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> Subscriptions”. On the left-hand side of this division put in the number of new subscriptions obtained, and on the right-hand side just write “Ind-Mag” and then fill in the number of individual magazines distributed by all publishers in the company. Whether a person be a magazine publisher or not, if he obtains a few copies of the magazines and uses them as sample copies in the regular work and places them, they may be reported on the Publisher’s Field Service Report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Beginning in February and continuing thereafter, every company should find an increase in publishers due to this new field of activity. The average of hours per publisher in the field should also be increased, because publishers taking individual territories around their home will now devote more time to that individual territory, as every week a distribution will have to be made of either </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> to those persons who are expecting the publishers to call with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Publishers should always have in mind the standard rate: that the magazine is 5c a copy, and this 5c should always be obtained when distributed each week on your route or on street corners or placed in regular distribution in the witness work. The only time that publishers should not receive a nickel is when a sample copy is left with someone whom you are trying to interest in becoming a regular magazine ob-tainer on your route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time counted and reported on your Publisher’s Field Service Report begins from the time you make your first delivery until you make your last, if you are making them consecutively each day, plus the required amount of time it takes you to go to and from your route; this time not to exceed one hour. The same is true when magazine publishers are distributing in railroad stations and other points. Their hours can be counted from the time they “take their position” until they leave, plus the amount of time it takes them to get to and from their position, this not exceeding one hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those regular publishers for the Kingdom who take up the magazine publisher’s work will also find their back-calls will be increased, because many of these individuals on whom you call regularly will want you to come back from time to time with new series of recordings, resulting in your starting model studies and also leaving new literature, all of which can be called back-calls. However, the distribution of the magazines each week from home to home cannot be termed a back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each company organization should stress this work to the publishers of the Kingdom so that the magazines published by the Society may have their proper place in the homes of all persons of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers will also play a very important part in this work, particularly those who are located in company territory. These can very easily build up routes. Pioneers who are working in territory not under company jurisdiction and will remain in a large city for several months can build up a route with these magazines, and when the time comes for them to leave the territory, the pioneers can point out to these Interested persons the importance of subscribing and then send in the new subscriptions.

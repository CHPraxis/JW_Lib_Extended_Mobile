<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Judge Rutherford Speaks on “Religion as a World Remedy”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Nation-wide Advertising Begins</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In a world of turmoil, war, bloodshed and distress, Jehovah, through His Theocratic organization, arranges an assembly of Christian people at Columbus, Ohio, July 24 to 28. Columbus will be the key city of a chain of conventions that ties together thirty cities by direct wire communication. This nation - wide convention will make it possible for persons everywhere to attend. At this time, when we see dictators carrying on an onslaught of “Rule or Ruin” policy it is appropriate that the people of good will in America should assemble together to receive comfort and edify one another. As </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> of June 1 states, “There may not be many more sueh conventions before Armageddon. Those who love the Lord will do what they can now to aid others to see and to appreciate the great convention that shall follow Armageddon.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Everywhere you go you will hear the brethren say, “Everybody’s coming to Columbus or to one of the other conventions.” That means all the pioneers, zone servants, regional servants, the Bethel family, publishers in the field, brethren in Canada and Mexico, and reports come in from Europe that the brethren are coming over from there. It will be a blessed assembly and something that the “other sheep” should not miss. A responsibility, therefore, falls on all of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions w’ho are now publishers of the Kingdom to see that everybody is informed of this convention, from coast to coast, and if they are looking for peace and righteousness then assist them in every way possible to get to one of the conventions as published in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> and elsewhere. The list also appears in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">LOCATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The biggest assembly will undoubtedly be at Columbus, &lt;&nbsp;&gt;hio. There the city officials and the state authorities have made it possible for the Society to use the spacious Fair (.rounds in Columbus, and this will accommodate a great multitude. The Society will be operating at this place its own cafeteria, book room, rooming assignments, etc., and a trailer city will</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">be built up by those who come in their trailers and house-cars. Ample provision is made for free parking for those who come in their automobiles. Arrangements will be made for immersion, hospital and nursery. For the details on these matters see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower of</span><span class="font2"> June 1, 1940. Other conventions that will be tied in with Columbus will have similar arrangements for the comfort of the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the Columbus Coliseum will be directed all the activities of the convention, not only for Columbus, but throughout the country. The convention opens Wednesday, and it is expected that the president of the Society will deliver the opening address. Everyone who can possibly be there at the opening of the convention should be ready for field service 'Wednesday morning and be on hand to hear the opening address by the president. This address will be carried to all convention cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The peak of the convention will be Sunday, July 28, at which time those assembled will hear the address delivered by Judge Rutherford, on the subject “Religion as a World Remedy”. The time of this address will be 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (Columbus, Ohio). 5 p.m. Eastern Daylight Saving Time, 3 p.m. Central Standard Time. 2 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, and 1 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Advertising</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the big things that must be taken care of between now and the convention is the advertising of this great assembly, and the Society has made arrangements to advertise it widely with the full co-operation of all publishers of the Kingdom. One of the biggest means will be the use of the phonograph and new record entitled “Remedy&quot;. Every person who has a phonograph will want one of these records to use between</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">now and the convention ; and there are 15,000,000 handbills to be put out as your local advertising. In addition, jou will be talking convention from now until the time of the convention. Every company should very carefully consider the article in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> on advertising, and do everything they can to assist the people of good will to get to one of the conventions. Are you coming to Columbus or one of the other conventions? Let every one of us now keep in mind that we are going onward to the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses!!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Convention Record Made</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Advertise The Theocracy ; that’s the thing! The Lord, through His organization, has arranged to have produced a phonograph record of 4J minutes which record is to be used to advertise the Columbus convention. It should be widely used throughout the United States and Canada for six weeks prior to the convention. Everybody in America knows that this will be the greatest convention ever had on the earth and they will want to advertise this event. Get your record quickly; order it through your company servant. The records will be shipped immediately. This record is a 12-ineh, double-faced disc and can be had at 45c. Pioneers will be furnished them free by the Society on receipt of their order, one to each pioneer. Every person using a phonograph should have one of these records to be used in the door-to-door witnessing, doorstep setups, soundcars, and every back-call and every model study. Use this record anywhere and everywhere, so that the people will know of the Theocratic Convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nation-wide Publicity</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not only will this record be used widely, but, in addition. 15,000.000 handbills are now being printed on the presses of the Society and will be consigned to every company and to pioneers not associated with companies. Pioneers in company territory will get them locally. They are free. Distribute these wisely, leaving them at every home; and after running the record advertising the convention, give them the folder as a reminder of the time and place. These folders should be distributed within the next six weeks, beginning as : soon as you get them, and having them all out by the time the convention begins. Point out to those people who are particularly interested that your local company is making arrangements to transport all people of good will to the nearest convention point or Columbus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">' Have this information for the inter-ested, so that they can travel with</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">; the brethren. Leave these folders on your magazine routes, place them with people taking the magazines on the street corners, having in mind that the greatest event of 1940 takes place July 24 to 28, and let those who wish to attend be informed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another handbill will be printed and distributed at the convention cities and near-by territory. The distribution of this second handbill will begin on July 20. At all convention cities handbill No. 1 should be out before that time. The second handbill w’ill have the name and address of the local auditorium and the time of the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the convention information marches will again be used to pub-liciz.e the big meeting, &quot;Religion as a World Remedy.” These information marches will begin on July 20 in all convention cities and near-by towns, and will Increase in intensity each day until the time of the public meeting. The information marches will be as follows: Two advertising publishers on each street; that is, two publishers placed in each busy city block and walking back and forth on that block. Each person will be equipped with placards on the front and back of his person and be distributing handbills. Hundreds of thousands of leaflets will be distributed in this manner. If you can get to a convention city a few days before the convention you can enjoy these additional privileges of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wherever possible the Society will furnish large banners for outdoor advertising. Local companies can also make up thejr own signs, to be put up wherever possible. Much work is at hand for the advertising servants at conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A Jonadab letter will be printed by the Society and mailed out by the convention cities to all of the “other sheep” whose names are on their back-call list. This letter w’ill be a special invitation to the people of good will near convention cities to attend the entire convention. and particularly to hear “Religion as a World Remedy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Special Attention</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Cities within 50 miles of a convention city should get in touch with the convention city within the next week and tell them how many letters they will be able to use, so that they can order the proper quantity from the Society. Convention cities and near-by cities can now begin to address their envelopes in which they Insert these letters when they get them. The letters will require lie postage, sent by third-class mail, unsealed. In a good many instances | the publisher will want to deliver </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">| (Continued &lt;m page 2, column 4)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rooming Accommodations a Big Problem</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Co-operate with Rooming Committee </span><span class="font2">All of the convention cities are busy at work lining up rooms in good, clean homes, as well as hotels, for the accommodation of the con-ventioners. This work begins generally throughout the country on June 1, and any time after June 1 you can write to the convention city where you will attend, at the address given below, for your accommodations. In writing for accommodations be very specific as to the requirements, setting out the following in a letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Name, street, city, state or province. Nationality, and white or colored. Date you expect to arrive in the convention city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Date you will leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Kind of accommodation you desire— residence or hotel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Number of persons In party. Number of rooms required. Number of married couples. Number of single men. Number of single women. Single or double bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">State definitely the amount you want to pay per person per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Good accommodations can be had for 75c per person per day in rooming houses, two or more in a room. One in a room, $1.00 and up. In almost all convention cities there will be some accommodations at 50c per person per day in rooming houses. Very good rooming houses will charge as high as $1.00 per person per day. Hotels will vary. The committee in every city will try to get the very best rates obtainable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So that the brethren may have an idea of what can be obtained in first-class hotels in Columbus, and most likely in other cities, the following rates are set out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Single rooms with bath, $2.50 and $3.00 per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Double rooms with bath, double bed: $3 50 and $4.00 per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Double rooms with bath, twin beds: $4.00, $4.50 and $5.00 per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Large-capacity rooms with bath, sin-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>“ The Messenger”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, in July, is certain to be the greatest assembly of Christians ever held in the United States. For the convenience of the brethren throughout tlie world, and particularly in the United States, the Society will publish </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger. The Messenger</span><span class="font2"> will cover the general report of the Columbus convention, and include many pictures, as well as all the high points of the other conventions throughout the United States. This report will be of great interest to every Kingdom publisher, and for those “other sheep&quot; who will be unable to attend the convention it will be a real blessing. It will refresh the memories of all who had the privilege of attending the convention and will bring them much joy. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font2"> will be a good publication to leave with the people of good will. Publishers having outstanding items of interest or good photographs taken at the convention may turn them over to the convention chairman, who will forward them to the Society with his report. Mark on the back of the photograph the city and state and what it is about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Orders for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font2"> should be placed through the local company servant, so that a bulk supply can be sent to the company and redistributed to those ordering. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font2"> may be obtained at 10c a copy. Remittance must accompany all orders, as no charges will be made on the accounts. All orders for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font2"> should be in Brooklyn no later than July 1, because we should like to have all the labels (for shipping </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger) </span><span class="font2">made out before the vacation period. </span><span class="font1">gle beds, 3 persons to a room, $2.00 per person per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Large-capacity rooms with bath, single beds, 4 persons to a room, $1.50 per person per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If anyone wishes to stay in a lower-rate hotel, please make request for such. The convention rooming committee will see what they can do for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your accommodations will be mailed to you. It will not be necessary to report at the rooming assignment booth at the convention on your arrival, but you can go direct to your accommodations. Those coming in trailers or house-cars or with tents will be informed by the rooming committee where the trailer camp is established, and thus save time upon coming to the convention. Columbus trailer camp is in the Fair Grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Special Request</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All brethren attending a convention should make their arrangements for rooms through the rooming committee in the convention city where they are attending: otherwise there will be much confusion. Please don’t hunt your own rooms or try to stay where you did before unless you have that assignment from the rooming committee. Persons hunting their own rooms might get rooms that are assigned to someone else and thus inconvenience the other brethren. Your co-operation will be greatly appreciated by' everyone, and particularly by those handling the rooming assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Set out below for the convenience of all are the city and state of each convention, the convention hall, the rooming committee address, and the zones expected to support each convention, if they are unable to go to Columbus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Code H—Name of convention auditorium, followed by address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">W—Address of Watchtower Convention Committee (parenthesis after address gives local city telephone number for rooming committee).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Z — Zones. The Society suggests that publishers in these zones attend the convention there named if conveniently possible and if not going to Columbus. If it is to the publisher’s advantage to attend the nearer convention he may, of course, do so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">On April 30 Brother Rutherford addressed a letter to all pioneers, advising that all the pioneers who were on the pioneer list on March 1, 1940, and continued thereon until the convention would be assisted by the Society financially on their accounts with their convention expenses, and, further, that all pioneers on the list on June 1, 1940, and continuing thereon until the convention would receive a ticket entitling them to their meals at the convention. This ticket would also be their identification card by which they would obtain literature at pioneer rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This letter and identification card were mailed out to the pioneers with their April statement about May 14. Therefore they should be in the hands of all pioneers, special pioneers, zone servants and regional servants by this time. Any who have not received their letter and card, please write tlie Society at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">New pioneei^ coming on the list after June 1, 1940, will be forwarded an identification card which will entitle them to obtain literature at pioneer rates at the convention. These tickets will be honored at Columbus and all other cities of the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses July 24-28, 1940.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Local conventions will be held in many cities of the United States and tied in with Columbus, the key convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, July 24-28. Each local convention will embrace a certain zone or territory. It will be the privilege of those within that zone or territory to take care of the expense of hall and local advertising. Contracts for such halls should be closed and signed as soon as possible, together with a down payment, so that there will be no question about the use of the hall at the time appointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Persons desiring to participate in hearing this expense in their respective zone or territory may make their contribution for that purpose to the treasurer of the convention where they attend. Each treasurer will make a duplicate list of the contributions for convention expenses, mailing one to the zone servant and one to this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wire Expense: All the conventions will be connected by land wires with Columbus, the expense for which will be charged to the Society. Any person or company desiring to participate in the general expenses of the convention and wishing to make a contribution may do so by sending the same to the Society’s office at 117 Adams Street and marking the same “Convention Expenses”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">No paid newspaper advertisements will be used at any of the convention cities. News releases will be furnished to tlie newspapers from time to time by the Society.

<p><span class="font2">From now until the convention, talk convention; but let your record do the talking. Avoid all controversies.

<p><span class="font2">Many companies are preparing signs from the handbill material that is furnished and will put these on automobiles and buses in which they travel to the convention.

<p><span class="font2">The 50,000 quota of publishers for the United States to lie reached during this fiscal year is in sight as the &quot;Battle Siege&quot; Testimony Period reports a new peak of publishers (company and pioneer) of 4S.1HG. Over 10,000 who attended the Memorial in Marell, however, failed to report any time in April. These I should seriously consider the matter in tlie light of revealed prophecies as brought to our attention in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and make every effort to become regular publishers of The Theocratic (Joikrnmum. If they do. we should lie well on our way toward a new quota by convention time in July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is a strong indication, upon analyzing the April report, as well as previous reports, that a minority of publishers are &quot;carrying Ilie load&quot; so fur as time :,ml back-calls are concerned; because, in spite of quite a number of publishers’ equaling and exceeding the quota of GO hours and 12 back-calls per month, no increase is shown for those two items. In fact, as the following table shows, compared with March there was a slight decrease, and compared with April of last year, quite a large decrease, in average hours. Each one should arrange to schedule his time so that lie can lie sure of having al his disposal a goodly share of ids time for sfbvktc or Tur.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Territory Covered?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is a tremendous amount of work to lie done if all the people of good will are to be properly informed about The Theocracy and how they may gain protection therein For that reason the necessity of being regular publishers is continually brought to our attention in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and through the columns of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> The people must be continually impressed witli the importance of definitely aligning themselves on the side of Jehovah; and, therefore, as the publishers increase these people can be called on more regularly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Proper Conduct in Magazine Distribution</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">General Information on the Convention</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Book Room</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mach convention will have its own book room, and those publishers who do not bring literature with them can obtain a supply there. Publications to be ottered will be one bound book and three booklets, on a contribution of 35c. Bring with you your phonograph and your new record, your witnessing case and magazine bag. Be ready to witness and aid the people of good will with the material the Lord has given us to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cafeteria</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At practically every convention tlie Society will operate its own cafeteria. Good, wholesome food will be served, and a small charge will be made so as to cover the cost of the food and expense of operating the cafeteria. Pioneers have been furnished meal tickets which will provide thorn free meals at every convention having its own cafeteria Every convention will need some xoluntcers to work at the convention, and anyone desiring to offer his services can send his name and address to the rooming committee at the comention, stating that he desires to help, and mention in what capacity his services can be used It would be especially appreciated if experienced cooks would write to conventions they an* going to attend. If you are qualified to be a sandwich maker, counter attendant, cashier, or stenographer, please state that in your letter, but have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in mind, too,</span><span class="font1"> that you will be pleased to accept any assigned duty. Those expecting to work in the cafeteria should bring with them their own aprons. Have in mind that everyone who volunteers his services at the convention should bring with him his field-service equipment, because we feel that not everyone who volunteers for other services can be given an assignment</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If it is your desire to work in the field all the time except when attending the convention sessions, then do not volunteer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Public-Address System and Sound-Cars</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All publishers having sound - cars, particularly No. 3 or No 4. should </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bring them to</span><span class="font1"> the convention they are attending Be sure you have them in good condition It would be well for all sound-car operators bringing their equipment to write the local convention they are attending, telling them they are bringing their sound-car and what the equipment is. It may be that they will have special use for it The following questions should be answered in your letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Kind of sound-ear, in good condition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nam»* of the operator?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How many days will you be at the convention?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Is the sound-car available for ANY use?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hospital</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Doctors and iniisi-s attending the convention should register as soon as they arrive oi write in advance that their services are available</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Immersion</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The immeis’on service is being arranged for 8 o’clock Sunday morning, at all convention &lt;_ it tes Those desiring to symbolize their consecration should bring with them a bathing suit and towed. It would be well for company servants to mention this, so that those desiring to be immersed will be properly equipped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Music</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wherever orchestras can be arranged it will be done. Musicians should bring with them their instruments so that orchestras can be formed. Those attending the Columbus convention who are able to play in an orchestra should please write the Watchtower Convention Committee, 117 Adams St.. Brooklyn, stating their name and what instrument they play, so that this information will be on hand prior to the convention at Columbus Bring your own song book with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Service in the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Certain hours at each convention city will be devoted to Held service, . so that proper publicity may be given I to The Theocracy, and particularly the public meeting, “Religion as a World Remedy.&quot; Everyone should try to engage in some form of field surv-!&lt;•♦&gt; during the convention, so that all publishers will be able to turn m a report. Thi-re are five distinct ways of witnessing;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">]. Door-to-door witnessing</span><span class="font1"> with literature, phono&amp;raph and special record. handbills, and the combination offer of one book and three booklets ori a contribution of 35e</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">2. Magazine publishers with magazine bags will be assigned special territory at the convention and near-by cities, for distributing the latest magazine. as well as handbills.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3. Special group for back-call work. All convention cities will arrange their back-calls beforehand, and these will be given to publishers desiring to spend their time making back-calls and arranging to bring those newly interested to the meetings. These publishers should bring with them the full series of the lecture “Government and Peace” or “Victory”, or some other series. Publishers obtaining new names in the territory assigned to th.em for door - to - door witnessing should <sup>!</sup> themselves make at least one or two back-calls on these during the convention time, before turning the name in for the local company to take care of.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">4. Information marches, using plac-<sup>1</sup> ards and distributing handbills. This will be done in all convention cities and other small or large towns within reasonable distance of the convention city</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">5. Sound-ears assigned spei ial territory and using the new record continually along with the musical record on the reverse side.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In making field reports each car 1 driver or gioup captain should add up the publishers’ field i eports and turn in the report each day Publishers not working in groups should turn in their individual repents for any of the above-listed field activities A complete report, including your convention activities also, should be turned in to vour hom«- company for the month of July All thoso associated with The Theocracy now know that the time is short for giving the witness. Between now ami the convention, and during the conviiilion particularly, everyone will desire to have a part in the magnifying of Jehovah's name and word, i All roads lead to Columbus or some I other assembly of the Theocratic Uon-| vention of Jehovah’s witnesses. Be on I your way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Read Carefully Letter of May 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On Muy 10 Brother Rutherford directed a letter to the Theocratic publishers regarding the proper conduct while engaged in the magazine distribution on the street. This letter is most timely and should be read at tlie service meetings a number of times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As emphasized in tlie May 15 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower, tlie people</span><span class="font2"> must desire to be on the Lord’s side. God’s Word cannot be forced upon anyone, and none will receive it until they desire a better condition than that which they have previously enjoyed. Our purpose, therefore, is to Help honest people get out from under religion to tell others about tlie Kingdom blessings, ft is our privilege to engage in the magazine work. So let us advertise tlie Kingdom and not just find fault with religion. When exhibiting the magazines speak kindly to the people, using expressions similar to the following :</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Attention, Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord’s organization K a Theocracy. All who come under it must fully co-operate witli one another to receive tlie Lord's ble-sing and in order to gain tlie best results in tlie field. Pioneers, because they put in all their time, can he used to accomplish much good, protided they co-operate with tlie other parts of tlie organization. When pioneers are sent a county assignment, notation is made on tlie assignment sheet as to any companies in tlie territory that should be conlacted before any witnessing is done by the pioneer in the towns assigned to tlie company. The pioneer's exclusive assignment is only for tlie portion of Ilie territory not assigned to Hie companies; and, as companies in many instances cover rural routes emanating from I their assigned towns, it is necessary that mutually agreeable boundaries lie arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Information is also given tlie pioneer as to the zone in which the county is located and the name and address of the zone servant. In many instances we lune sent on to tlie zone servant all good-will names for the county so that, when opportunity affords, he can get in touch with these persons. When such territory is assigned tlie pioneers, they should immediately wrile the zone servant, inquire if he lias any names, and co-operate with him in developing any goodwill interest. This will also be aihice to the zone servant that the county is being covered, as we do not advise him direct. To get results in such territory, co-operation is very necessary. Pioneers are</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Distributors’ Accounts</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies and pioneers who have opened witli the. Society a magazine distributors' account should make regular remitlance on this account monthly. You need not wait until you receive your magazine state-nient to make tlie remittance, but can make it at any time during tlie month. Itemitlanees will appear on the statement only if they are received before the first of the month, if for three months no remittance is received on your account this automatically cancels your distributors’ supply. Publishers should be making remittances weekly for magazines, and in turn the company should remit monthly on their account. Some companies have been negligent.__</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">privileged to assist companies with their studies when requested to do so. They should always direct goodwill interest to the company meetings and assist them into tlie field work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When writing in for territory </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">do not ante</span><span class="font2"> to lie assigned to a zone, or with a zone servant, but always state witli what company you wish assignment, or what county you desire.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Shall We Make Our Quota?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The lal-iem king .mil swiftly moling events that lune oicurred in the last few weeks hate greatly stirred up the ‘'locusts'’ in the United Suites to the acute realization that it is almost all up to them to make good the world-wide quota set for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign. The armed hordes of evil are running wild throughout Europe. They have ruthlessly disrupted organized witnessing in Denmark, Norway. Holland. France and Belgium, and the witness work in all countries is greatly menaced. It therefore becomes imperative for the “locusts&quot; in the United States to zealously direct all their energies and time towards fulfilling the responsibilities committed to them by the great Theoerat. The days are Indeed evil, and Armageddon is not far distant. We must clear the decks and put aside all hindrances and obstacles that are in the way of complete devotion to Jehovah and the Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the “Locust Army” Testimony Period of June and for the remaining extended days of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign to July 24, every lover of righteousness will diligently and zealously do everything in his power to help make the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowerquota.</span><span class="font2"> There are ever so many tilings in our favor: the best of weather; long days in which to witness in the evenings, until 9 p.m.: more publishers : plenty to do. and lots of literature with which to do it: and. above all, the Lord's rich blessing upon our every effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Subscriptions! Subscriptions!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The most important phase of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign is the procuring of subscriptions for the most vital magazine in the world. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> The reports up to the time this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> goes to press show we are far below our quota of subscriptions. To make up this deficit and make our quota during the remaining days of the campaign (now to July 24). we must greatly impress upon the people of good will the absolute necessity of their subscribing for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and having it come to their homes regularly. twice a month. As Brother Rutherford emphasizes in the “Instruction&quot; record. “The means provided for the instruction and aid of his people on eartli is the publication of his message in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and kindred publications. . . . Every person who hopes to be of the ‘great multitude' should possess and diligently study </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.” </span><span class="font2">We ourselves know how necessary it is to our eternal welfare to diligently study each issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font2">In the regular field service and at every back-call and model study, point out the numerous advantages of now subscribing for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> especially in view of the excellent offer of a book and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font2"> booklet as a premium with a year's subscription. With the wonderful publicity given the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine by the street-corner witnessing and magazine route, we should find the people of good will in a ready frame of mind to consider our proposition of subscribing for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> Repeatedly speak to your friends, neighbors, and business associates about subscribing for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> Continually leave sample copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> with each interested</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Campaign Extended</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">I erson you call on, and arrange to call back within a week or ten days with the &quot;Instruction&quot; record and for a subscription. Make the &quot;Locust Anuj&quot; Testimony Period the biggest w itness of any one month to date. This just before the assembly of the Theocratic Convention oe Jehovah's witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">More Time In the Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How are you getting along in your individual quota? To be up with your quota, you should by the 1st of June have obtained two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions and placed 14 books and IGO booklets. No doubt a number of publishers have done this and more, but the majority are far below their quota and must put forth every effort in the field service if they are to gain it by July 24. Carefully examine and consider the progress which the company has made as shown on your chart. This chart should be kept up weekly, so that every publisher can see just what must be done in order to reach the company quota. The company servant should keep the publishers advised weekly of just how many subscriptions, books, and booklets each publisher must place if the company is to make its quota. The publishers, in turn, must promptly submit their field reports, so that the chart can be properly kept up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">One thing is very certain; and that is, that much more time must be devoted to house-to-house field service by ail the publishers.</span><span class="font2"> June is a month in which we can all put in more time in the service than in any other month. The weather is ideal and the days are long and the publishers can arrange to put in one or two evenings (to about from 6 to 9 p.m.) a week witnessing with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font2"> booklets, taking along a few books and some </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazines for those who show real interest. Such evening work with booklets has been very productive in the past, and all company servants and zone servants should stress and arrange for this I feature of the work throughout all June and up to the convention. Start witnessing groups from the homes of those with whom you are conducting model studies, returning from the field to hold the studies. The same procedure can be carried on wherever there are book studies. It may be possible to start the studies a half hour later than usual, during June and July, to allow for more time in the field service. This arrangement will have the added incentive of encouraging the people of good will who attend the studies to take an active share in distributing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font2"> booklets, and people of good will living near the studies can be invited to attend the meeting being held that very same evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Magazine Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren everywhere are much enthused over the street-corner magazine work. This is fine. However, each company and publisher should see to it that the enthusiasm for this phase of the service does not cut down the time spent in book and booklet distribution. There is a proper place and time for every feature of I he witness. The new work with the magazines should not be carried on at the expense of the house-to-house and back-call work, but in addition to our other field service. This is evidently being done.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Convention!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">as reports to date of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign clearly show. It now becomes essential for each publisher to plan his field service for each week; otherwise the publisher will find himself neglecting one or two features of the service. Be sure to engage in every feature of the witness, but do so in a proper manner and thus obtain the greatest amount of results from your labors.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Attention, Company Servants</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Company servants should exercise more care in making remittances to this office. Before mailing a check examine it carefully. See that it is properly signed, and that you have sufficient funds in bank to cover check when presented. See that the figures and written amounts agree. Errors are expensive both in time and in money. Time is expended to look up the accounts ; for extra bookkeeping entries; for writing for explanations. There is extra postage and delay in settling accounts. Some banks make an extra charge of 25c for every error returned. Following are some of the most common errors:</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>500 New Pioneers</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>More Responding and Many More Still Required</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus instructed his followers to pray, “Thy kingdom come.” Never has this prayer been more appropriate than at this time. The world is in utter confusion, with the blood of hundreds of thousands being shed, and literally millions are losing their lifetime possessions. No one of the world feels safe and secure. The only remedy is this kingdom for which all sincere followers of Christ pray to our Father in heaven. To honestly utter this prayer, however, one must be willing to do his part in advising the people of good will about that kingdom. (Matt. 24:14) In doing so one must put forth every human effort, withholding nothing, and so consecrating one’s all to the service of The Theocracy. This was stressed in the letter of May 10 “To All Publishers of the Theocracy”, concerning pioneer service. The company should read and study this letter carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those who can now possibly arrange to devote their entire time to the service of our King should lose no time in volunteering for pioneer service. The May 15 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">aptly states: “Privileges wasted and let to slip by unused are gone, and now what is to be done to buy back time or recover from such lost opportunities must be done quickly. There is no time to waste. . . . The faithful delight in the law of God and hasten to do his will.&quot; It is the joyful doing of the Lord's will that insures one of Jehovah’s approval and salvation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Booklets! Booklets!!</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Make June the Biggest Booklet Month Yet</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The time is here for us to give serious consideration to the placement of books and booklets as well as obtaining subscriptions. For the month of April this year we are approximately one million booklets behind April of last year. The offer for this year was identical with that of last year! Why this tremendous difference in the number of booklets placed? Someone says, “Magazine work is responsible for it” : but even the 383.503 magazines placed hardly offset a drop of a million booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This matter is too serious to be lightly overlooked, particularly in view of the very important message contained in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font2"> booklet. That message must be placed in the hands of the people promptly. April is past; we cannot do anything about it; but we can do something about this condition during June and July. The excuse that magazine work is responsible for the drop can be accepted only as an excuse, at best; it is not a reason. Magazine work is an additional privilege of service to be done Saturday afternoon and evenings when we are not engaged in other branches of the service. It was never intended to replace the distribution of books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What are we going to do about it? The answer: Put in more time in the service. Daylight saving time is in effect in a large portion of the country, and in all sections the daylight extends well into the evening, enabling all of us to put two or more hours in the service after supper. Let us utilize this time for a wider distribution of the Kingdom message contained in the books and booklets particularly. Arrange special group witnessing parties for evenings. Special campaigns with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees </span><span class="font2">booklets can be put on during these periods, having magazines along also. These may be left where the interest warrants it, and then go over the same territory shortly with the regular campaign offer. Let us catch up on our booklets as well as our books and subscriptions before convention. Let us manifest to the Lord our appreciation of the wonderful table He is spreading for us in the midst of our enemies, particularly in this country, where the privilege of service is still available to the Lord's people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have enrolled over 500 publishers for pioneer service since the call went out recently, and there are a number of others waiting to start out around convention time. Why not now begin to make your plans to get started by that time? The company servant can send for necessary questionnaires for the u«e of brethren in the company that are considering putting in all their time in the King’s business. Don’t delay, but act now. while there is still time to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies are writing us of their need of pioneer help. No doubt right in their midst are publishers who can. by putting in pioneer time, take care of those needs. It is not necessary for pioneers to go elsewhere; consider your home territory first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How many pioneers will be enrolled by July 24? We hope 3.000!</span></p>

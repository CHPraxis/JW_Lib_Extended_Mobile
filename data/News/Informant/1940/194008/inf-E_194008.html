<p><span class="font3">Jehovah in his goodness and mercy poured out upon his people a blessing to overflowing, a blessing all of which could not be contained by his grateful people. The Theocratic convention of Jehovah’s witnesses came to a conclusion Sunday night, July 28, but what occurred at the convention will never be forgotten; for a witness began there which will be carried to the ends of the earth. Brother Rutherford was richly blessed by the Lord and, because of Jehovah’s favor, was able to come to the convention and address the assembly at Detroit and 17 other convention cities. It was a most joyful occasion to hear the instruction of the Lord brought to us. and the climax of the convention came when the president of the Society delivered the lecture “Religion as a World Remedy”. IIow true it was, as Brother Rutherford stated, he had to present both sides of the argument because of the failure of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to put up their man to talk in favor of religion I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Religion received a real beating at Detroit, and the exposing of that wicked organization continues as the dirt of that wicked organization is brought out and made plain to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">New Book Released</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The companions, alongside of Jehovah’s witnesses, cheered and applauded with real joy the presentation of the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> by the president of the Society. This was one of the most thrilling moments of the convention. There is no question In the minds of the brethren who attended the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah's witnesses that It was the I,ord's will that his people assemble this year in Detroit at the Convention Hall and the other convention cities tied in by direct wire. The Lord’s hand was manifest from beginning to end in all the preliminary arrangements, in trying to find a place for the convention, and in all the detailed activity of the convention itself. Even as the Lord has directed his organization for many years and continues to do so, so did he direct what should be accomplished at this convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bluff Failed</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was a glorious light from start I to finish. The enemies of The Theoc- I </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">racy </span><span class="font3">manifested their violent oppo- <sup>1</sup></span></p>

It was a tremendous witness against them and for The Theocracy. Jehovah gave the victory !</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font3"> will set out the full report of the activity leading up to the convention and what happened at Detroit and the other places, and this will be read with real joy by all the publishers of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sufficient to say here is that the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses was arranged and directed of the Lord, all to his praise. Jehovah’s servants were refreshed and strengthened and they have returned home with renewed vigor to serve in the interests of the Kingdom and <sup>1 </sup>assist the other sheep to find the I place of safety.

<h6><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Campaign Extended to End of- September</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">All of the Lord’s true people know that religion is doomed. This information, however, is not limited to the Lord's people. It is the purpose of Jehovah to publish this fact far and wide as a timely warning to all the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The origin of religion, and its effect on men and nations, and its ultimate end, must be brought to the attention of all people so that those who love righteousness may for ever forsake religion and take their stand on the Lord’s side and live and so that those who hate righteousness may be thoroughly warned before destruction comes upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There can be no question in the mind of any who heard Brother Rutherford’s thrilling speech “Religion as a World Remedy&quot;, or who have read this book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font3"> regarding religion's doom. Religion's doom is an established fact decreed by the great Theocrat, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord’s Doing</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Evidently the Lord directed the preparation for the great witness to be given during this special period. A year ago, when the 1940 Calendar was arranged, he had this special</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Messenger</span><span class="font3"> magazine, 64 pages, with many illustrations, we hope to publish within the next thirty days. This will carry a complete report of the Theocratic convention, showing the Lord’s leading and arranging of this convention and the happenings at Detroit and other conventions tied in with it. It will bring to you a vivid description of the high points of the convention, Brother Rutherford’s lectures on three different occasions, the release of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font3"> the new phonograph, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Kens</span><span class="font3"> No. 6, the threats of the enemy, and their failure to succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not only will </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font3"> be a pleasure for those of The Theocracy to read, but it should find its place in the homes of many interested, now people of good will. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font3"> is ten cents a copy. A limited edition will be printed. Order through your company servant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">period, &quot;Religion's Doom,” set so that it would follow immediately the greatest convention of the Lord's people to date and the release of the Lord’s new instrument, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion, </span><span class="font3">for carrying forward his purposes concerning The Theocracy and the judgment of the nations. The Lord has thus prepared tlie setting. He has prepared the instruments being used, and He has prepared His people by giving them such a crystalclear vision of the reasons why religion is doomed and the certainty of its being accomplished that it is now up to each and every one to do his part. Every creature who loves Cod and The Theocracy will now take his stand foursquare for the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The organization should go into action immediately. All territory is virgin territory for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fifth Column</span><span class="font3"> booklet. Therefore the company servant, territory servant and back-call servant should get busy immediately and arrange their territory for this work. Back-call names in each territory should be called upon as the territory is worked. All new publishers and good-will interest attending model studios and other studies should be supplied with a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> and should be encouraged to take </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> to their friends and neighbors.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This new design of phonograph was announced at the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, and, as was stated at the time, we are not tilling orders and not accepting orders. Please do not order this phonograph until announcement is made later as to its manufacture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All orders on hand for phonographs will be filled with the old model, and these are being shipped regularly until caught up with orders. It will help the office greatly if you will not order the new phonograph now, until proper announcement is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> No. 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tlie Theocratic convention was full of pleasant surprises for us. One of these was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font3"> No. 6, for our use in the Held work. This new instrument, provided by the Lord, shows the pitiful condition of the world today and sounds a note of warning which all will do well to heed. It shows, for the information of those of good will, why the religionists and their dupes are so bent upon persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses, and shows definitely from Scripture, as well as from facts available to all, that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy constitutes the chief moving factor in the destruction of all democracy, in the regimentation of the people, and in setting up a rule in the earth in opposition to Jehovah's Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All publishers should have and use this new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font3"> in their door-to-door work, as well as on back-calls ami at model studies. Their territory should be thoroughly covered with it. These are 50c per thousand, remittance with order. If possible these should be ordered at the same time literature is ordered. to save expense in shipping. Pioneers may have one thousand free with order for other literature. If pioneers order separately, remittance should be sent at 51 ic per thousand, because of additional expense to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your Supply</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Prior to the convention the Society shipped out more than 600.000 copies of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font3"> ready for use throughout the world. Consignments with sealed orders were sent to the larger companies in the United States, but we were not able to supply all companies, by any means. These large companies have begun distributing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> during the “Religion’s Doom” Testimony Period.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>September Will See More Distributed</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">The first barrage of this new booklet was laid down just prior to the Theocratic convention. This was nation-wide and so thorough that it took away the enemy’s breath. They had desperately tried to stigmatize Jehovah’s witnesses by accusing them of being the iift.li column In this country, and then they set their demonized hoodlums to develop and execute mob action against these publishers of the Kingdom. They felt they had things pretty well their own way and had Jehovah’s witnesses on the run, and then came the withering blast of two million </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fifth Column Uncovered</span><span class="font3"> booklets widely distributed from coast to coast in less than one month, exposing who are the real fifth column.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The evidence in support of the argument contained in the booklet was indisputable. The facts supporting the charges made were so clear and forcibly presented that there was no getting around it. This message in the hands of the reading public was a terrific blow to the Hierarchy. The effect of it upon the Hierarchy can be approximated by their desperate attempt to stop Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Quota for 1940 Exceeded by 8,000!!</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">Not only has that quota of 50,000 publishers at which we have been aiming this year been exceeded during June, with a total of 58,009 company and pioneer publishers reporting, but it is gratifying to note that 55,000 of those were company publishers, as indicated by the table shown below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The table also shows that we reached a new peak in hours, for the first time reporting over 20 hours per publisher as an average. This good record is undoubtedly due to the strenuous efforts expended by many to attain the GO-hour goal suggested by Brother Rutherford last January. Back-calls, however, took a drop, being lower than the previous month as well as the same month last year. This should be remedied by more publishers’ engaging in the back-call work and striving to reach the quota of 3 back-calls per week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As indicated in the July </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> all who signed tlie petition in June should be called back on. Therefore back-call slips should be prepared for this purpose. These will be glad to hear the lecture “Religion as a World Remedy”, when you receive it in recorded form. They are all likewise good prospects for the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> and should be given the opportunity of obtaining it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the remaining months of this fiscal year all should put their shoulders to the wheel, getting after the back-calls and model studies and using the new instruments provided for us in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion, Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font3"> No. 6. at the Theocratic convention and ever since; but, by the Lord's grace, they were not permitted to succeed. The Lord has still kept the door open so his people can continue in the service. Let everyone, therefore, avail himself of the opportunity of participating in the service with greater zeal than ever before.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Magazine Work </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Routes and Street Method</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord’s blessing has been manifested upon the magazine work since its inception, to a very marked degree. This branch of the service lias done more to draw the fire of the enemy and thus expose their true condition to the people than any other branch of the service in so short a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Have You a Route?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One main objective of our work is to expose the true condition of the enemy as well as to aid the people of good will. However, we never expected the enemy themselves to cooperate so completely in this exposure as they have done. Evidently the Lord maneuvered them to do that very thing. Their course of action in opposing the magazine distribution, and the devilish spirit manifested, has more than verified the statement contained in the literature regarding their being a part of the Devil’s organization. Therefore this work should be pushed with vigor. All publishers should establish as many magazine routes as possible and see that those people are promptly served with each issue as it comes out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Magazine street work should be consistently carried on and not in any wise diminished because of the tlireats of the enemy. The only time that it is proper to even consider withdrawing from the street witnessing in any area is when it is physically impossible to stay on the street because of mob action; and even then we should not completely desert the territory, by any means, but rather should, as directed by the Lord, be wise as serpents and harmless as doves, and plan to counteraid the offenses of the enemy by using a more telling blow against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even in many of the most violent mob action areas the brethren are continuing the street magazine dis- ' tribution. They are staggering the time of their going out, and the places to which they go. so that the enemy cannot foretell what they are going to do next and how to organ- ; ize against them in advance. They dispatch publishers from the homes I</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>The New Book “Religion”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">The new book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font3"> which the Lord has provided by the pen of Brother Rutherford, is what its front page so aptly describes, as a timely warning to all the world, treating of religion, its influence upon men and nations, and the result. Over 350 pages of the greatest material we have ever had. Each one of its twelve chapters tells its own story clearly and forcefully. The book is interspersed throughout with beautiful descriptive pictures, adding much to the force of the presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is no need to here go into the thrilling message it contains. You will appreciate that when you read the book. Each company should arrange immediately lor </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> studies at strategic points throughout their territory. These studies should be available to all people of good will. All model studies and back-calls should be worked into them so that all who are feeling after the Lord may have an opportunity to obtain the vital information contained in the book. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> studies should replace </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> studies where the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> book has already been covered one or more times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Author's Edition is 50c per copy; tlie regular edition, 25c contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">instead of from the hall, and in various other ways outwit Ilie enemy so that the work is carried on. In some places, because of these conditions it is necessary to limit the time on the street at each service to one hour or even half an hour. The fact is that tliis work can, by the Lord’s grace, be carried on in spite of opposition. The mob really works up interest in the magazines, and it is up to us to supply the people with the truth by taking advantage of every means to keep pushing the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The foregoing, of course, applies to trouble points only. Magazine witnessing on the streets in other areas should be carried forward in the regular manner. This is a real war. Let each one do his part, trusting implicitly in Jehovah and his anointed King to maneuver the forces of the enemy as well as his own organization to accomplish his good pleasure and advance the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following excerpt from a letter received in the office is quoted here because it is a very good practice to follow in street magazine witnessing:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;The ----- company have found</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">that a great increase over the number of magazines placed by the brethren on the street corners has been accomplished by approaching individuals who are either standing or slowly walking along, instead of the publisher’s merely standing in one spot all the time and expecting the public to come up to him and inquire about tlie magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Of course, care is exercised in approaching the people so that they will not become offended and so that no excuse can be justly given of any attempt on the part of the publisher to create confusion, either by loud talk or by actions unbecoming a publisher. The publishers find this much more interesting and less ‘dragging’ than to merely stand in one place and let the public take the initiative action.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">With this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> there is being mailed another letter (Aug. 20) addressed &quot;To All Publishers of the Theocracy”, concerning the pioneer work. Quite a number of publishers at the various conventions obtained pioneer applications, and these are</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>53 Countries Report During “Battle Siege”, in April</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s rich blessing was upon his people as never before during the &quot;Battle Siege” Testimony Period, in April. Despite the turmoil and distress throughout the world, particularly in Europe, Jehovah’s army of &quot;locusts” moved into action during the month of April with their ranks swelled to 78,006 publishers, tlie greatest ever. This is indeed a joy to the hearts of his people, and a marvelous number, in view of having no reports then from many of the European countries involved in the war; however, reports recently received show that the brethren there are pressing forward with the work as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is gratifying to see the great increase in the back - call work. Throughout the whole eartli Jehovah’s people are moving forward in full unity, aiding the people of good will to take their stand for The Theocracy. With the back-call and model-study work on the increase we look forward to the greatest number of publishers ever during the “Challenge” Testimony Period, in October. Set out below is the complete report for April.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Society has made or will, within the next few days, make consignments of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion </span><span class="font3">to companies having more than 50 regular publishers. All other companies throughout the United States, and pioneers, will have to order their </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> books. Companies having already received consignments and placing their supply must reorder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As announced elsewhere in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> this campaign is to be extended throughout the month of September, affording everybody an ample opportunity to have a part in this witness before the end of the fiscal year 1940. The issue is clear-cut now. No one can serve two masters. It is a matter of either taking a stand on the Lord’s side and doing his will or staying on the side of the enemy. Tills campaign affords a splendid opportunity for all of the anointed and their companions and all people of good will to demonstrate to the Lord their appreciation of the momentous times in which we are living and their implicit faith in the purposes of the Lord by uncompromisingly proclaiming religion’s doom, using </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion </span><span class="font3">and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fifth Column Uncovered </span><span class="font3">booklet, on a contribution of 25c, during the remainder of August and all of Sejitember.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">coming in now. As some put it: &quot;The Devil is forcing us into the pioneer work.” Perhaps the Lord would be more pleased if they had made up their minds to enter the work sooner, instead of being forced to do so by “circumstances”. Undoubtedly many in the companies are still making arrangements to get into this field of service, and others wondering if they should or not! Why not enroll now and get it off your mind?</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Offered Too Records Will Play Important Part</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">As the year progresses Jehovah's ambassadors can appreciate more and more the importance of the campaigns and their naming. Now we come to the “Challexge&quot; Testimony Period, which is the first campaign in the new fiscal jear. The month of September closes the Society’s twelve-month report, and with joy Jehovah's witnesses go forward now witJi Ilie challenge. Jehovah's servants in the earth will maintain their integrity and hold high the banner of the Lord, proclaiming The Theocracy. Jehovah's witnesses are “persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalilies, nor powers, . . . nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the lo\e of God . . . ” The courageous pushing on of Jehovah's witnesses with tlie Theocratic message in the face of mounting opposition is a Aisible expression of Jehovah's challenge io Ilie enemy organization prophetically slated at Joel 3:9-11 and so splendidly set out in modern terms in I’rh’r/ion, pages 318-324.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">New Booklet Released</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the close of the convention Brother Rutherford immediately made arrangements for the publication of a new booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy.</span><span class="font2"> This booklet contains the two wonderful lectures of Saturday and Sunday delivered to the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. The initial distribution will begin October 1 with the “Challenge” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion.</span><span class="font2"> a new instrument placed in the bauds of Jehovah’s servants, along with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy,</span><span class="font2"> will be offered to the people on a contribution of 25 cents. Every effort should be made on the part of I he publishers to set out the importance of the people’s reading these books. This we believe can be accomplished particularly through the use of the record P-230 (“Message of Hope”) and P-229 (Part 11 of &quot;The End”). If the person is not able to contribute a quarter but really wants to read, make every effort to leave some booklets with him; and it is suggested that a combination of three booklets on a contribution of ten cents be offered, these being </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees, Judge Rutherford Cncoucr-s Fifth Column,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">C o n s piracy Against Democracy.</span><span class="font2"> Before leaving, however, if no literature is taken, be sure to offer the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font2"> on any contribution. leaving a copy with the people free if they promise to read and can’t contribute even a penny. Where the booklet is placed, undoubtedly they will be sufficiently interested for one to make a back-call and run the series of lectures on &quot;Religion” and &quot;The End”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Speedy Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tlie booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font2"> contains a message that the people of America need, and they need it in a hurry. Millions of copies of Ibis new booklet should be placed in the hands of the people prior to November 5; therefore it will take careful organization on the part of all servants in tlie company, particularly the stockkeeper, to see that his order is in early and that he has his supply on hand in good time for a real concentrated witness in the thickly populated territory. The company servant, of course, will check all these details and see that the order is in. We suggest that you order, on tlie average, fifty copies (or each publisher in your company, and each publisher should try to the best of his ability to distribute these 50 copies to the people, in addition to five copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font2"> per publisher. This we believe every publisher can do in the 31 days of October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Intensify Back-Call Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Special attention should be given to the work of calling back on the people of good will. The order blank enclosed with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> makes provision for your obtaining the new records “Religion” and “The End”, as well as the special record &quot;Message of Hope”. This matter should be placed before ail the publishers in the company, so that they can order their individual record P-229, I’-230 for regular door-to-door work and as many sets of “Religion” and “The End” as they need to efficiently carry on their back-call activity. Since the convention we feel sure every publisher appreciates the need of making three baek-calls every week, or an average of twelve a month. Some day practically all of our work may be back-call work; so let’s get in stride now and get the names and addresses in our files.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your Order</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Have in mind that no more consignments will be made of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion, Conspiracy Against D e m o c ra c y. Kingdom Keirs</span><span class="font2"> No. G, nor of the new records. Company servants must see that their orders are placed, and we suggest that at distant points they be sent in by air mail. The factory is working day and night trying to catch up with present orders, and we anticipate that by the time you receive this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> and your Order Blank we shall be ready to take care of the onrush of orders for all books, booklei s and records preparatory to the “Challenge” Testimony Period. Orders will be given attention according to their arrival at this office. If because your order gets in here late, or there are too many to fill ahead of it, your literature does not arrive by October 1, then proceed witli the same intensity and vigor with other literature and records \ou have on hand. Make the “Challenge” Testimony Period </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">month to be remembered in the witness against the Devil's organization and for The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Brother Rutherford's personal letter “To the Theocratic Ambassadors&quot; which appears in Ihe Author's Edition of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font2"> he states, &quot;It is your commission to help tlie people of good will to see that religion is Hieir mortal enemy, and that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Christianity</span><span class="font2"> is their way of escape. Help them to know and serve Jehovah and His King, and thus gain life everlasting. ... As ambassadors of the Theocratic King hasten to carry the needed information to all who will give heed. That is your privilege, the greatest human creatures ever had.” May Jehovah guide and direct you in your preparations for a bold witness during the “Challenge” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Order Blank</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">One Order Blank is sent with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> to each company and pioneer. The company servant, along with the sound servant, back-call servant, and stockkeeper, should check their supplies and fill out this order blank as to the company's requirements. At your next meeting you should find out from each publisher who has a phonograph whether or not he wants his own personal record, “Message of Hope,” for door-to-door witnessing. They should each have it. It costs only 50 cents when ordered on this order blank. Check carefully the required number of sets you need of “The End” and “Religion” records and order these. Do you have sufficient supplies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font2"> that each publisher can have five copies for the “Challenge&quot; Testimony Period? Have you ordered sufficient booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font2"> that each publisher can have fifty of these? Have you checked all your stock? It is a good thing to be well supplied now</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Pioneers Still Coming</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Almost 4,000 Enrolled</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">For the past several months the Society has sent to each company servant a letter to be read to the company, outlining the great privileges to be enjoyed by those who elect to spend their full time in serving The Theocbacy. Those letters have borne their fruit, and the pioneer list moves on toward the 4,000 mark 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society is pleased to advise that as this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> goes to press there are 3,735 publishers enrolled in the pioneer service in the United States. All these enrolled pioneers should report their activity each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Quite a number of brethren enrolled at the Theocratic convention at Detroit and at the other conventions, and many others since as a result of the convention. We expect to continue to receive many applications for this most important and blessed service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are still some companies throughout the country requesting the aid of pioneers. These companies will be given the needed help just as soon as we have the pioneers to assign to them. However, we are wondering if there are not some right in their own territory who would be able to enroll. Keep this matter before the brethren, and if more applications are needed let us know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">England, has reached an enrollment of 1,000 pioneers!</span><span class="font2"> Surely we should have more than four times that in the United States.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Pioneer Allowance</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Some pioneers are sending in their convention Identification cards without showing on the face of them any request for allowance. We presume in such cases that those brethren do not desire any convention allowance and we are not crediting </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font2">account with any. If some of the pioneers who sent in their cards without marking the amount on them wish the convention allowance and overlooked this point, they will please so indicate on their September report card by stating specifically how much they desire, not to exceed Jf25; also the convention city they attended. If you filled out your identification card properly and forwarded it to this oilice your account will be credited; it will not be necessary to show this again on your report card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">with all the books and booklets. The first orders received will be given the first attention. We suggest that you carefully study the Order Blank, discuss it at the service meeting and Sunday evening meeting, and then get in your order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers in company territory should send their orders in with the company servant’s order, to save shipping expenses. Company servants should check with pioneers for this purpose. Remember, the “Challenge” Testimony Period is only four weeks away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Tile new series of recordings comprising •‘Religion”, Sunday's lecture from jletroit, and “The End&quot;. Satur-daj's speech, are by far the two greatest recordings vve have had to date, and for clarity, fo reef illness and powerful material they cannot be beat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The l&gt;ord used Brother Rutherford Io protide for His people the most powerful instrument against the Totalitiirian-Hierarellj -Religious combine we have ever had in recorded form to dale. Words are inadequate to describe the irresistible power of the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All of this means much more to us than simply listening to a good speech and getting enthusiastic about it. It means that the Lord is entrusting to us the responsibility of carrying this very important message to the people. As we consider how t he attending circumstances—the opposition to (he Kingdom, the Devil and his crowd's determination that there should lit' no speech delivered, Brother Rutherford's illness, and other things that would normally prohibit the preparing and delivering of sueli speeches—were all maneuvered by the Lord to give greater emphasis and importance to the speeches instead of in any wise interfering will, them, lie realize their importance in His arrangement. This also increases our responsibility in connection with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Petitioners Should Hear the Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every person vvlio signed the petition io the governor of Ohio, and every person of good will in the records of the various companies throughout the country, should be given an opportunity to hear these recordings as soon as possible. When making new back-calls arrange for these new recordings to be put on first. At the initial presentation j&gt;nt on each speech complete. Ho not try to break I hem up into model studies at the first presentation. Arrangements for model studies for the present may be continued with the previous series of lectures and retain tiie new series for back-call work and public meetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">This new publication comes as an ■answer to the question in the minds of countless multitudes who received the distributed invitations to the Theocratic convention but were unable to attend, as to when Judge Rutherford's speech to the public would appear in print. Conventioii-ers are as eager as any Io read it. In the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conxpiraep Attain'd Dcmoeraei/</span><span class="font2"> you have the full text, not only of the public address &quot;Religion as a World Remedy&quot;, but also of the special address to the convention Saturday on “Times and Seasons&quot;, including the &quot;Message of Hope&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The title &quot;Conspiracy Against Democracy&quot; calls attention Io the painful fact that democracy in the yet remaining bulwarks of this system of government is under heavy attack, and why—because in the democratic countries the proclamation of The Theocratic Government is still continuing, with increasing success, and the totalitarian henchmen of the Devil and his demons must crush democracy fina'Jy in order to stop Ilie activities of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Message of Hope”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is the title of the new introductory record. It has everything—fire, enthusiasm—and is a most gripping and convincing introduction to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Itelioum.</span><span class="font2"> and is a message every oni' should hear. Every phonograph should be equipped with one of these. The other side of the “Message of Hope’ Is Part 11 of Saturday's speech. “The End.&quot; which makes a splendid opening for arranging for a back-call. In fact, for either a doorstep setup or introducing the literature in the homes tiiese excellent records cannot be beat. The &quot;Message of Hope&quot; is so convincing that practically every unprejudiced person who hears it will also want to hear the other side. Every publisher who has a phonograph, therefore, should put in his order immediately for this record I'-229, l'-2.'’.(&gt;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This record may be had, if ordered nifli complele sets before (lelober 31. 1!H&lt;&gt;. at 5ne each. The complete series is being offered at a special rale up until October 31. There are 30 recordings, 15 discs, all of these on a &lt;•&lt; in t ri I ml ion of $7.50. After October 31 Ilie regular rale of 70c per record, or (I for $3.50, Mill apply. If you are ordering more of one speech than of the other you can figure I heir cost on the rate of 50c a disc. (Cost Io pioneers is shown &lt;m special order blank.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This campaign should occupy Ilie evenings of every publisher in the country throughout the coming fall and winter. It is of very great importance that this should be pushed with vigor while we have an opportunity of publishing lite Kingdom message in this country. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Wateh-loirer</span><span class="font2"> clearly proves that Armageddon is not lar off. It therefore behooves all of the anointed and their companions to work with even greater diligence than ever before while it is still day. There is no lime now to slack the hand. We should have at least (lo.PIHl model similes going every week. That is only an average of one model study per publisher. It can he done, and if each one realizes his responsibilily to The Theocracy he will pul forth every effort to attain this quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Theocratic ambassadors, fittingly, then. Ihe booklet's trout cover artistically displays the symbols of the two greatesl remaining democracies; to wit, Ihe Independence Hall low er against Ihe background ol the American Hag, ami Ilie clock lower of London's Parliament Building against a I’nion Jack background. It should prove very catchy to all liberty-lovers. Just 5c for your personal copy, till released for public distribution during October's &quot;I'hal* i.i.xi.i:&quot; Testimony Period. The usual rate lor self-covered booklets will be charged on company and pioneer orders.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Locust Assault-Method Foretold</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The 1949 Calendar pad designates September as the month to stress and courageously apply the &quot;doorstep setup&quot;. In support of this the pad quotes a portion of Joel 2:9. to wit, &quot;They shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Here is what the new book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lieli-tlioit.</span><span class="font2"> has to say regarding the fulfillment of this ancient prophecy: &quot;'They shall climb up upon the houses.’ God's faithful servants go from house to house to bring tile message of the kingdom to those who reside there, omitting none, not even the houses of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and there they give witness to the kingdom because they are commanded by the Most High to do so. ‘They shall enter in at the windows like a thief.' They do not loot nor break into the houses, but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">then xct up their plionopraphx before, the doors and iciudoirs</span><span class="font2"> and send the message of the kingdom right into the houses into the ears of those who might wish to hear; and while those desiring to hear are hearing, some of the 'sour-pusses' are compelled to hear.'’—Page 19G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the effectiveness of the phonograph. which is a part of the Lord's provided sound equipment, the same book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kelinion.</span><span class="font2"> says: &quot;Sm’li burdenbearers are, to wit: . . . the radio: sound-cars; phonographs : . . . and such things. The radio was used as long as it appeared to be Ihe will of Ihe Lord ami to (he extent that his will was performed; and this was done without regard to the bitter opposition of the enemy. It lias continued to he used only occasionally as the Hord permits. Jehovah’s witnesses' speaking to the people when meeting them face to face affords a better opportunity than radio does to prove their faithfulness and to maintain their integrity and to claim the attention of those of good will. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">. . . The sound machines are noir even more effective than the radio. </span><span class="font2">and the results much greater.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">September closes out the fiscal year 194(1. The report for the month of September should be in tiie Brooklyn office by October 1 (or October 2) if at all possible. We are asking the co-operation of all publishers and servants to this end. All publishers will do their part by seeing that all tiieir reports for the month are turned in to their servants by Sunday. September 29. The company servant's part is to see that the report is tabulated for the month of September and is mailed to the Society before ten o'clock Sunday night. September 29. Any publishers' reports that are not in by that time, do not wait for them: show them in the following month's report. Distant companies, particularly those west of the Rocky Mountains, are being asked to send in their reports by air mail.</span></p>

The effectiveness of this method has not weakened with the wearing off of the novelty of it to Hie people now quite familiar with it. True, it causes an instant protest from the &quot;goats&quot;, who at once identify you, but such therefore forestalls waste of any time with the unreceptive and speeds you along to those of good will who have a hearing ear for the &quot;joyful sound”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Increase Sound Attendance</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those persistent in the use of the doorstep method know, and tiie records bear il out, that this method increases the number of sound attendance and thus puts your sound equipment to greater use. A’ machine is nonproductive increased sound attendance means more good-will created: it means more literature placed; it means more back-calls and model studies; in a word, greater results. That the Lord approves this method is shown, not alone by hi&lt; blessing upon it in the past, but in that at the Theocratic convention lie caused to lie introduced a new model, a vertical-type phonograph, specifically designed for this doorstep procedure and to push it more intensively than heretofore. Wit li the thousands of portable phonographs throughout the land we should have a larger sound attendance. Doorstep setting-up exercising xxill do it. If you have been timid or indifferent about using this method up till now, faith in the Lord will be manifested by starting in with it at least during this September. So doing, we should, all together, have the greatest sound attendance reported for September that we have ever had for one month.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">&quot;The year 1940 is certain to be the most important year yet, because Armageddon is very near.” It behooves all who love righteousness to put forth every effort to advertise The Theocracy while the privileges are still open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A special privilege “made to order” is now ours of offering to those of good will the opportunity of having one year’s subscription for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine, one bound book and a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font2"> booklet on a contribution of one dollar, and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> will come to them by mail twice monthly thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our work during this three-month </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign compared with last year should be interesting to every company. The question is, Are you doing better on subscriptions, books, and booklets? You should. Have you a progressive chart or thermometer, the same as last year, showing the quota for each of the three months for the entire company, and then marking it up week by week so that the publishers can see what progress is being made on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign? This is important and will undoubtedly help all companies to make their quotas. All publishers fully appreciate that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> is the means whereby the Lord instructs the people who love righteousness. By His grace let us attain our quota during the Il’utc/i-</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">loicer</span><span class="font2"> Campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Why not fix up a chart immediately, based on the quota of three </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions for each of the publishers, 20 bound books, and 250 booklets? That would mean that the quota for a company of 100 publishers for the three months would be 300 new </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions, 2,000 bound books, and 25,000 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let Every Publisher Participate</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If every publisher strives for the above quota during the three-month </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign a marvelous witness will be given in the United States. Just now we know there are 47,091 publishers, because there were that many out in March. April should find many more; May, still an increase, all in preparation for the great convention in July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All who are physically able to do so should thoroughly cover their individual territory (and work with the company and study groups in group witnessing) presenting the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> special offer from door to door. These, as well as others not able to go from door to door, due to physical infirmities, should present the offer to everyone in the territory who has shown interest in the past, by making back-calls on them. (Re-</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">member that quota .of 12 back-calls per publisher.) Those unable even to leave the house should mention the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> offer to those who call to collect, deliver, solicit, or for any other reason. Those on their sickbeds or in hospitals should have sample </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> copies and subscription blanks handy and call the special offer to the attention of those who call and of the doctors and nurses and visitors. Those whom you have on your magazine routes should be shown the advantage of having </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> come direct to them by mail. If you have relatives and want them to have life, see that they get </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, even</span><span class="font2"> if you have to subscribe for them. In short, during this important campaign don’t overlook any privilege to get </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">It is important that every one do his part </span><span class="font2">during this campaign that the Lord has so graciously arranged for us. Endeavor to get more than your quota of three subscriptions and of bound books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Get Busy with These</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the March statements we sent out around 30,000 expiration back-calls to the companies and pioneers. Every one of these should be called on promptly and the people given the privilege of again subscribing for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> They have been taking </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font2">and are familiar with the valuable information it contains. Show them the latest issues and point out ro them why they should be receiving </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> regularly and continuously. Endeavor to obtain a year’s subscription, or at least one for six months. Subscriptions obtained from those whose names are shown on these slips should be reported as new subscriptions. If they do not subscribe, agree to personally deliver </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> to them on your magazine route.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Why Not 50,000?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The month of March, with 58,874 different persons attending Memorial services throughout the country, was the one month when we fully expected to attain to at least 50,000 field publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The May 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> paragraph 41, presents the matter: “The responsibility of Jehovah’s witnesses is to proclaim the truth, and this they cannot avoid. The responsibility is noiv upon Jehovah’s witnesses and servants to take the kingdom message to all such and sound it studying </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> is clearly and completely outlined by Brother Rutherford in the record “Instruction”, and every publisher should have one of these records and use it in his door-to-door and back-call work during this campaign. Order this record through your company. Now that the cold, rainy weather is over, use should be made of the doorstep-setup method of using the phonograph. You will find that many </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions will be obtained in this way. Where the phonograph cannot be used, present the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Testimony Card; it brings the special offer to the people very plainly and briefly.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">THEOCRATIC CONVENTION OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES! COMING?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Remember “Salvation” and “Refugees”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While we should keep stressing subscriptions as the primary offer and always open our witness at the door with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> we should be prepared to quickly present </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ReJugees</span><span class="font2"> on a 25c contribution when the subscription is not obtained. Also, be prepared to offer three booklets on a 10c contribution, or finally </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ReJugees, </span><span class="font2">on a contribution if possible, but free if the person cannot contribute. Don’t let the door be shut without your having properly presented the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font2"> booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Remembeb; Your quota is one </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription, 7 books and S3 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ReJugees</span><span class="font2"> monthly. If you did not reach this during April, put forth a special effort during May to make up what you were short.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Place “Refugees”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Twelve million booklets are a lot; do your share in getting them out. Leave one at every call you make, if at all possible. Have them with you wherever you go. Take them along with you on your magazine route and on your street-corner witnessing. Ask those upon whom yon are making back-calls to take a supply and be responsible for placing them with their friends and neighbors. Make the second lap of our three-month campaign count I within hearing even though they cannot induce rhe obslinate to hear and obey.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, even though we did not reach our quota of 50,000 publishers in this country, we did take a very definite stride toward that end. We attained during the month of March an all-time peak of 47,091 publishers in the United States. This includes, of course, regional servants, zone servants, pioneers, special pioneers and company- publishers. When all things are considered, the weather, grippe, flu, bad roads isolating other</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Magazine Bag and Phonograph Orders</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">AU publishers should please note that the Society is one month behind in filling orders for magazine bags, and twelve weeks behind on filling phonograph orders. We fill these orders according to the dates received. Companies should continue to send in their orders, and we will give them as early attention as we can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">brethren, making it very difficult for many of them to do much witnessing, this is very good. April, with its spring weather, saw most of these obstacles removed and we fully believe that what was not accomplished in March will in all probability be attained in April— 50,000 publishers. Each one should carefully consider this matter, and if anyone finds that for one reason or another he has not participated in the service during March and April and has not contributed toward the 50,000 publishers, now is the time to do something about it. The question for each one is, Have I borne up my end in striving to attain the quota of 50,000 publishers?</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Despite an increase of approximately 13,000 publishers over the same montli last year, there was a drop of over 150,000 pieces of literature placed. Our bound books showed a slight increase, but our booklets fell very far short of last year. I-’or some reason the brethren are not pushing the booklets with the seriousness that they deserve. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ReJugees</span><span class="font2"> booklet, with its message of vital importance to every person of good will that will ever attain to life, should now be pushed with energy and zeal and made accessible to each and every creature.

<p><span class="font2">Our hours are slipping, compared witli last year. This was also true for the month of February. Note the comparison and let each one determine to do something about it In May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our back-calls are struggling upward. but very weakly. We are still far from the 12 back-calls a month recommended by Brother Rutherford in his recent letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Regional servants, zone servants and company servants should take these points into consideration in their planning of tlie work and in their presentation to the brethren. Every publisher should examine them with an eye toward increasing their personal Kingdom efficiency.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">So the 1940 Calendar pad, for May, announces, and adds as an argument therefor the text, “All thy children shall be taught of the Lord ; and great shall be the peace of thy children.”-—Isaiah 54:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How appropriate all that! May is the middle month of the intensive campaign for at least 100,000 new subscribers for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font2">Quoting Isaiah 54:13, as above, emphasizes that the Master Teacher of the universe, Jehovah, has a publication on earth by which He sends Biblical instruction to His people, and that publication is admittedly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> Every subscriber and faithful reader of that magazine is convinced of (hat fact. 1’hys-ical facts today show that those who refuse Jehovah’s teaching through His chosen channel cannot get into or under His organization nor remain there, neither can those who never have the chance presented to learn of the Great Teacher by Christ Jesus. Only those who do will ever enjoy the real and enduring peace inent ioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the face of this our duty and obligation is plain, to wit, to get more </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions, taking advantage right now of this premium-featured three-month campaign ; this besides route work of delivering individual magazines to the homes. The paid-up subscription is preferable in every way. It assures the subscriber of his regular receipt of the magazine over six months or a year; no further financial worry during that period, but a sense of independence, as it puts the Society under obligation to him. It is like having wisely laid up for the future. It is cheaper, considering the 24 issues for the year as delivered individually on a route, besides which there's the free special pre-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Company Servant and Treasurer</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Companies should use the remittance slips in sending money to the Society on their accounts. Please fill them out correctly. Always show the name of the company at the top of each form. Be sure you have an exact duplicate for your files, so you can check with the monthly statement sent you from the office. All items are to be included in the company stock account listing except those for magazines or donations to the Society. Do not cross out any items or write in anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FOR EXAMPLE: If your remittance is for magazine bags, Bibles, or phonographs, that remittance should appear on the line of the company stock account. If your remittance is for magazine distributors’ account, then show what portion of the remittance is for the Watchtower magazine distributors’ account and the Consolation magazine distributors’ account. The same is true when you send in subscriptions; ’ show The Watchtower and Consolation separately on the lines provided for that purpose. This is necessary in connection with our Post Office permit. The donation line is used only for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It would be a great help to the Society if the company servant and treasurer carefully check these remittance forms and fill them out properly and list all amounts sent to the Society under the six headings mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Please remember that remittances must accompany all renewals or new subscriptions. Companies sending in subscriptions should show the name of the company on each slip and should record these names and addresses on the Subscription Record Sheet. Before inserting slips in the envelope, be sure that you have an individual subscription slip to compare with each name on your sheet, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the Kingdom interests increase throughout the land every company servant and his assistant servants should strive diligently to co-operate in line with the instructions of the Society, which will help to dispatch the work more quickly.</span></p>

Also, as surely as the Government mails operate he is assured of getting the magazine promptly, at the earliest delivery, direct, not second-handedly, and which relieves the Kingdom publishers of just that much delivery work. Let the Government do the work, so relieving the.tax-paying publishers of the transportation work involved, in behalf of their other field activities.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Are You a Subscriber?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The above applies not merely to the general reading public, the 100,000 in prospect during the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign; it also applies to the Kingdom publisher who presents to them the special campaign offer. Why be inconsistent and urge upon others something of which you do not personally avail yourself, namely, a subscription? Iio not put yourself on your own magazine-delivery route and deliver it copy by copy to yourself by extracting a copy from among the magazines you receive at a reduction for route-delivery. There may be economy in that, but it is better to be a regular subscriber at the regular rate and get your </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-toicer</span><span class="font2"> direct through the mails, as soon as it is released. The magazine is worth its weight in gold, and the contribution to the Society for the subscription goes right into the Lord's organization, and is not misspent, Let your own personal subscription boost the Society’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> list. Every financially able Kingdom publisher who campaigns for more </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscribers should be a subscriber himself. There is a feeling of assurance and wisdom and satisfaction about it. Ask any regular active subscriber. He knows!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Phonograph Spring Repair</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Some brethren have complained that the Society has sent them the wrong kind of mainspring for their phonograph motors. All phonographs made by the Society from No. 2001 up to the present number use the same size and type of mainspring. The difficulty is that the party who removes the broken spring fails to reclaim the center-sleeve from the broken spring. Brethren repairing phonographs should please note this and take the center-sleeve out of the old, broken spring before throwing it away. Then you will have no trouble in using the springs we supply.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The magazine route work must be done on a country-wide scale if we are to adequately care for the goodwill interest. All brethren who are fully awake to the “times and seasons” will see that this part of .the Kingdom work is vigorously carried on in their territory assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is not because the brethren do not see the many merits of tlie magazine route work that they fail to put this into operation. It is mainly due to the fact that they have a hard time “starting”. Let each one “start” by making a full list of all the names and addresses of the persons of good will in their assignment.

<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Frequent Calls Get Results</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 20 and the results of the January bound-book campaign strongly emphasize the importance of arranging for and making back-calls. It is the people who have already shown a kindly interest in the Kingdom message' to whom the publishers are under obligation to call back on them with additional information, and thus obey the Lord's admonition to ‘feed the other sheep’. All people on your magazine routes are excellent prospects for back-calls, and the publishers should take advantage of every opportunity to call on them with the phonograph recordings. It is by repeatedly and regularly calling on the people that we aid them in keenly realizing the grave importance of their taking a definite stand On the side of the Theocratic Government. We know it is a matter of life or death to them and that the Lord has chosen us of all peoples of earth to bring forth Uis life-giving provisions. Let us therefore do our part by frequently calling on all interested persons in our territory with the magazines,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Pioneers! Pioneers!</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">As a result of the letter dated March 11 and addressed “To All PUBLISHERS OF IDE THEOCRACY” many have written for further information about pioneer service, and we are pleased to state that during March and April over 300 pioneers were enrolled. Another letter was sent all companies under date of April 32, and by the time this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> is received this letter will have been considered by all companies at least twice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While the 300 newly enrolled pioneers will be quite an aid, they will by no means be sufficient to properly care for the needs of the various companies and the unassigned isolated territory. So each company will receive with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> one copy of Application for Pioneer Service and letter outlining the requirements of pioneers. Have someone discuss these at one of your service meetings, preferably a pioneer associated with the company. If one. in the company desires to use this application, turn it over to him and write us for any additional copies required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of effort and time. The very next time you go witnessing, call on these interested ones with either </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> and briefly explain to them the purpose and object of your call. Leave a copy of the magazine with them, on contribution or free, arranging to deliver the next issue. You cannot expect people to ask you to bring the magazine to them. You must take the initiative and just bring it to them. They will take it. Get your magazines now and see how many persons you can “bring&quot; it to regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Without a doubt the magazine route work is a big avenue for arranging back-calls and model studies and getting more publishers in the Kingdom work, which work is increasing by leaps and bounds. It is of the utmost importance that the people of good will in your territory regularly receive the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> magazines. This is your personal responsibility, and you should “start'’ this now, if you have not already done so. literature, and phonograph recordings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The ultimate purpose of back-calls is to get the people of good will sufficiently interested to want to study tlie Kingdom message and make it their own and become publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In all your back-calls and model studies begin to bring to the attention of the people the importance of attending either the Columbus convention or the nearest convention city. And, of course, begin planning now to attend yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reports show that we are not placing as many of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees </span><span class="font2">booklet as has been expected. We must all put forth more diligent efforts to place a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font2"> booklet witli each person to whom we witness, even if necessary to leave a copy free where interest is manifested. Also, get all the persons who attend model studies and upon whom you make back-calls to put out these booklets. Leave a few copies with them and request they distribute them among their neighbors, friends, and relatives.

<p><span class="font2">The cheapest way to ship literature is by freight, either truck or rail; but in order to take full advantage of the freight rate 100 pounds must be shipped.&quot; Quite a few of the large companies and some pioneers send orders in every week for 30, 40, or 50 pounds, which means that the Society sends it by mail or express because it costs a little less this way than 100 pounds of freight would cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For example: A company ordered 47 pounds of literature. By express the cost would be $2.87; by mail, $2.61; by freight, $2.72. The Society shipped it by mail and paid $2.61; but the Society could have shipped to this large company 53 pounds more of books and booklets for the $2.72 instead of 47 pounds for $2.61.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Co-operation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If tlie company servants could set a date, such as the first and fifteenth of every month, if necessary, on which orders are mailed to the Society, then you could almost always order 100 pounds, especially If you combine pioneer orders with company orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It would be well for companies to announce a few days in advance of when the next order is going to the Society, so that company publishers wanting any special.Items can order them through the stockkeeper, and the pioneers living in the company territory could also turn in their orders to be shipped along with the company order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Where pioneers group their orders together to make up 100 pounds, it will be sent to one address under the same bill of lading and then the literature will be distributed by the stockkeeper or the pioneer to the pioneers ordering. Companies that are too small to order 100-pound shipments should order what literature they need, and it will be shipped the cheapest way. Company servants, stockkeepers and pioneers, please cooperate in ordering and give your orders careful thought before sending them in. Fill out the order blanks properly, please, and you will be able to save the Society money and considerable time.</span></p>

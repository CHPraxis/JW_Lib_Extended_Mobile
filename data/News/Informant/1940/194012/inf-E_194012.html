<p><span class="font1">Prior to the receipt of this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> all preliminary preparations should have been completed by all concerned to make this “Coub-age” Testimony month the greatest ever in the number </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font1"> placements and quantity of booklets left with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In order to properly follow through, so that there may be no ‘loopholes’, constant attention will be necessary on the part of the various servants in the companies, and especially on the part of the company servant and the zone servant. The zone servant will have had information from companies in his zone as to the amount and kind of excess literature on hand, so that he can see that this is properly distributed among the companies and pioneers. If not ALL of the old booklet stock in his zone moves out, it should not be for lack of his attention or of co-operation with other servants.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>More than 10,000,000 Booklets Ready for Witness</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">By this time the preparations for the greatest of all booklet campaigns are completed. There are now over 10 million booklets on hand with the companies and pioneers, and both have ordered several million more. Therefore companies and pioneers are fully equipped, and all company and pioneer publishers prepared to start off in this campaign with a bang. It is estimated that 5 million of the 10 million booklets now on hand will be placed during the month of December. It will be done. That is a vast amount of literature ; life-sustaining food for the people of good-will, a great joy and blessing in store for all who have a part in the distribution, and a terrifying blow to the Devil’s organization. All good-will names, territory, and sound equipment should be in order and ready. Special wrappers also should be pasted and handed out to facilitate the booklet distribution. Everyone should be thoroughly familiar with the details of the special offer and the quota set for company publishers and pioneers, as outlined in the November </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Every Publisher Ready for Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A splendid example is given us in Ehud’s being fully prepared when he went forward to meet the enemy. He trusted in the Lord for guidance and strength, and when the proper time came he quickly drew the sword and with the greatest force plunged it into the belly of tlie fat king Eglon. The same thing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are several thousand copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font1"> left. These have been round to be very interesting to persons of good-will and easily placed in back-calls. The few remaining copies we are letting go at live cents a copy. Get your extra supply while they last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">literally swamp the territory with these booklets. Constructive suggestions should be made as to how these combinations may be placed in the field. Pioneers who are adept at this should assist the company publishers, both in the field and by offering suggestions at the service meetings. Regional servants should also emphasize this special campaign at zone assemblies all during December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every study group should go into full swing during this campaign, properly covering with the 7-booklet combinations the territory assigned to the group. The study conductor should arrange for witnessing on Sundays, and during the week as well for those who can put in additional time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The entire organization should (as indicated by the “Ehud” series in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower)</span><span class="font1"> go forward in harmonious action with the end in view of disposing of ALL the old booklets in stock!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">with this booklet campaign—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">preparation, courage,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">speedy action </span><span class="font1">are essential requisites. There should be a peak of publishers in December. There are ten days in particular on which everyone should get out, the “Christmas” holiday, when practically everyone will be free for field service, and the Saturdays and Sundays. All publishers should arrange their affairs so that every minute of time possible will be used in getting out into the field to place this special offer with the people. Each company publisher should be equipped with his quota of 10 combinations for the month. Remember also the foreign territory. Proper covering of the foreign territory with this special offer and preparations as outlined in the November </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> should be stressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At each service meeting a weekly report should be given. This weekly report will show the progress that the company is making in attaining its quota of combinations placed, week by week. This will enable the companies to be better prepared to attain their quota and push forward this campaign in their territory with increasing force. Every publisher will be on his toes to do his part. To make this campaign have a fitting climax it is being extended to include New Year’s Day, on which day every publisher will get out into the field and begin with the new booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font1"> in every combination, as well as begin covering territory preparatory to the February campaign.

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Pioneers Are Ordering</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The November </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> called our attention to a new booklet by Brother Rutherford—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied.</span><span class="font1"> We commence distributing this booklet on January 1, using it exclusively throughout that month in order to prepare the field for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">campaign that is to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To the anointed and Jonadabs alike this booklet will be found thrilling and refreshing beyond words; and to the people of goodwill, indispensable. These are located in the homes, in the business offices, on the streets, and even in the airraid shelters. In fact, everywhere where people congregate such people of good-will may be located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Why the Campaign?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. To carry to these hungering souls the message contained in this booklet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">2. To prepare the field for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> campaign to follow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">3. To direct the people of goodwill to look for and expect to see Jehovah's witnesses on the street with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The publishers who are faithfully availing themselves of their great privileges now are being used by the Lord in this manner </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font1"> feed and comfort tlie people with provisions from the Lord’s storehouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font1"> is consigned to each company on the basis of 30 copies for each publisher in the company, and each publisher should have a part in the campaign and see that his 30 copies are placed in the hands of the people. This should be done in the regular house-to-house work and in your magazine routes. They may be placed with the magazines on the streets, and, of course, all names on your back-call files should be supplied</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>New Folders Prepared</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The Society has prepared a new folder advertising the new series of lectures “Religion”, “The End,” “Victory,” and “Fill the Earth”. Henceforth, when orders are sent in for transcription folders this new folder will be sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another leaflet has been prepared advertising the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Religion.</span><span class="font1"> It is neatly arranged, printed in two colors, and on the inside of the folder there is a place where the company can stamp their local address and telephone number. This is designed to encourage back-calls on the part of the individual reading this folder or having obtained any of the literature. If people show interest at the door upon obtaining the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font1"> or other information, and do not desire to give you their name and address, it is well to leave with them one of these new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font1"> book folders and write in the name and address of the Kingdom Hall (if not with a copy. This campaign should be so complete that the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font1"> should be discussed among the people everywhere, and this can be done by Jehovah’s witnesses’ enthusiastically carrying on this campaign. Take them with you to your work. Have your associates in the office and factory reading and discussing it. Take them to the market places ; magazine publishers holding them before the people in the streets and in every other manner possible keep this booklet prominent during the month of January; and if we do that, much will be accomplished in preparing the field for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A New Peak in January</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are over GO,000 publishers associated with the companies. Practically all of them can get out some time during the month. At 30 booklets each, this will run close to two million copies. There are some four thousand pioneers and regional and zone servants on our list, who will he doing their share, devoting all their time to the Kingdom service. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that we can distribute between 2! and 3 million of these booklets during the month of January. If each one tries conscientiously to do his part there is not any doubt about the results. Each one who receives a copy of the booklet is an excellent prospect for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font1">We can call back on them and talk </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> understanding^ because of what they have read in the booklet, and take their subscription or at least place a copy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> with them on a contribution of five cents-with good prospects of calling back later and getting a subscription or including them in our regular magazine route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">already stamped in), as well as the telephone number. Let’s make it as convenient as possible for those prisoners </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to be freed</span><span class="font1"> now, by giving them all the aid and necessary information required so that they may get in communication with the Theocratic organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Zone Assembly Information</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The Society is providing a new form for gathering information for the zone assembly. The zone servant will send these forms to the company servant just preceding the zone assembly. Each company servant should fill in the information requested and forward it to the zone servant as instructed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The object of this work is to establish closer co-operation between all servants and publishers of The Theocracy and aid one another in more effectively discharging the obligation that the Lord has placed upon his people at the present time.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>1941 “Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses”</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">When you read the report by Brother Rutherford as furnished in the 1941 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font1"> you will appreciate more than ever before the power of Jehovah. The world-wide activities of Jehovah’s witnesses under continuous enemy fire during the past service year will be a joy to everyone. Not only will this amazing report bring a thrill to those already associated with the Theocratic Government, but the people of good-will will be astonished when they read the 1941 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Order your copy immediately. Your contribution of 50 cents will help cover the cost of this limited edition. Large companies would do well to get a few extra copies for the new interest that will be coming in during the year. A remittance should be sent in with all orders. We hope to be filling orders about the middle of December.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>1941 Calendar</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The 1941 Calendar is exceptionally beautiful and expressive under the text “Salvation unto our God . . . and unto the Lamb.” (Rev. 7:10, A.R.V.) The artist portrays the Scriptural symbolisms In modern detail of Jehovah’s “strange work” of judgment now fast reaching a climax amongst the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The date pad sets out in two colors the testimony periods for 1941, along with other field-service instruction and suggestions. The 25-cent contribution is asked for each copy, or one dollar for five copies when mailed to one address. Companies should order the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font1"> and Calendar at the same time, along with remittance. The Calendar will be ready December 15.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Trouble Affidavits</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">In response to notice in the July, 1940, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> under the heading “Mobs”, brethren filed with the Department of Justice several hundred affidavits showing clear violations of Sections 51 and 52 of Title 18, United States Code Annotated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where local state or municipal officials have either participated in mobs or knowingly permitted mobs to assault Jehovah's witnesses, or have arrested and oppressed them, and affidavits of such occurrences have been filed with the Department of Justice, it is suggested that a letter be written now to that Department at Washington, calling attention to the violation of the above statutes as shown by your affidavit on file with the Department. In such letter you can ask the Department’s co-operation and also offer to assist them in any possible way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Specific request should be made in the same letter as to what action has been or will be taken against such officials. When you receive reply send to legal desk at Brooklyn the original or a copy thereof, together with a copy of what you wrote.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The Society has caught up on all orders for the phonograph, the old model. We have on hand 220 that can be shipped immediately. It will be several months before the new vertical-type phonograph will be announced as ready for delivery, due to the impossibility of getting certain parts for its manufacture sooner. Those desiring phonographs should get the old model now and use it; as long as they last they will be shipped out immediately. The regular price is asked, $8.00, to cover the cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do not place orders for new model phonographs yet; just the old model.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>You Can Help the Office</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The company servant is to carry on all correspondence with the Society regarding the company activities. Many times we receive orders or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">letters</span><span class="font1"> from various servants or publishers in the company and time is wasted checking up to see if the one writing has any connection with the company. It is further suggested that if anyone in the company desires information regarding addresses of companies elsewhere, in the event they desire to visit them or get in touch with them, this also be requested through the company servant, to insure prompt reply.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Coupons</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">To ihe publishers of The Theocracy the placement of the Kingdom message in the hands of the people is of paramount importance. They are anxious to take advantage of every possible means available to accomplish this. Many of the brethren have found that thev can leave considerably more literature in the hands of the people if they will accept coupons in exchange tor the literature. This can be done in practically every section of the country. Many of the brethren are overlooking opportunities of giving an additional witness by not taking advantage of this provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In every section of the country where products are sold with valuable coupons offered as premiums the publishers should tell the people that they will be willing to exchange literature for these coupons. Many pioneers and companies are now successfully leaving literature for coupons where otherwise they would not be able to make any placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Coupons taken in in exchange for literature by the publishers are redeemed at the rate of 40c a hundred full coupons for the following products:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Octagon and Kirkman soap </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">products </span><span class="font0">Rumford baking powder products Luzianne coffee and tea Ballard flour</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the above, Health Club coupons for baking powder products are redeemed at 30c a hundred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These coupons may be sent to the Society, at 117 Adams Street. Brooklyn, by pioneers and companies, but not by individual company publishers. Company publishers should work only in harmony with and under the direction of the company in selecting coupons. They may place the literature with the people at the above rate. These coupons should then be turned in to the company, and sent to us by the company servant when the collection of the coupons becomes </span><span class="font1">pany publishers’ average number of back-calls surpassed that previous peak. Next month these new peaks will appear in the all-time records. It would be well for each company and pioneer to compare their monthly averages for their monthly report with tiiese tables at at least one service meeting during the month.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>“Pioneer Instructions”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">In the interest of the entire Theocratic organization, and in particular the pioneer branch of The Theocracy, the Society is sending to all pioneers, zone servants and regional servants a special sheet “Pioneer Instructions”, which will give them a clearer picture of the Theocratic arrangement and enable them to appreciate more fully the part they play in the great drama of vindication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord's people today, pictured by Ehud, which name means “united”, must be at full and complete unity; and in harmony therewith “Pioneer Instructions” says: “All appreciate the fact that the objective of the Theocratic servants, whether they be pioneers, company servants or publishers, or zone or regional servants, is one and the same, that of co-operating in unity under the direction of the Lord through his organization, giving a uniform witness and aiding the ‘other sheep’ to see the issue, that they may take their stand on the Lord’s aide.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Upon a careful and prayerful study of “Pioneer Instructions”, together with determined effort in carrying them out, there should be greater co-operation and unity among the pioneers and zone, regional and company servants as outlined in the Organization Instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">large enough for a reasonable shipment, preferably 1.000 or more full coupons, and the company’s account will be credited for the coupons sent in; likewise the pioneer’s account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Do not expect credit on your account too soon, however. After you send in the coupons time must be allowed for the shipment to get to this office, then to be assembled here and finally sent to the clearing house for these coupons. It usually takes them from two to four weeks to count the coupons and send us their । check. This check may arrive at the Society's office after the statement is mailed on the first of the month : therefore it would take an additional four weeks before the company or pioneer would actually receive notice that the account has been credited for the coupons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When sending coupons to us. please carefully observe the following instructions :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">1. Always send a letter giving the necessary information concerning the coupons you are sending. This letter may be attached to the outside of the package &gt;&nbsp;or sent separately. If the letter contains a money order, report cards, orders or anything else besides the information pertaining to the coupons, send it separately ; do not attach it to the package. and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">never put a letter 'inside the packaae.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">2. In your letter state the different* kinds of coupons, the total full value of each kind and the total full value of all coupons in each package. We are not interested in knowing how many half coupons are in the package, but only the total number of full value coupons. Two half value coupons should be counted as one full value coupon. Thus, if you have a package of 2,000 half value coupons they should be listed and counted as 1,000 full value coupons. Only coupons from products listed above should be sent to us. Other brands cannot be redeemed for cash by the Society.</span></p></li></ul>

If, because of rain or some other such reason, the magazine publishers are unable to get out on the street on a Saturday afternoon or night, or any other scheduled night, tlie magazines should be pushed in the regular door-to-door work at all times, placing them singly at 5c (or older ones free as samples to be used as ‘seed’ for a subscription later on) or in combination with books or booklets. For instance (except during the special booklet campaign), a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> could be placed with a bound book and a self-covered booklet on contribution of 30c. or with booklets on a 10c contribute</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Routes</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As more publishers see the . of holding and properly covering individual territories, a corresponding increase of magazines placed by tlie route method is apparent. And this method aids the publishers in becoming better acquainted with those of good-will in their territory and builds up their back-calls and model studies. Weather conditions will not cause placements of magazines on routes to fluctuate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Street Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tlie street work continues to be an excellent means of placing magazines, especially with persons who would not otherwise have tlie opportunity of receiving them, due to living in inaccessible territories. Not only does the street work provide this additional outlet for tlie magazines, but, just as important, it serves as a means of public identification of Jehovah’s witnesses, as well as identification of both the “other sheep” and the “goats&quot; by their course of action toward the Lord’s people. The current issues of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font1">should be offered on the street; never offer “out - of - date” issues. However, in the case of continued articles, if some are left over it would be in order to have the preceding issues containing those articles in the event request is made therefor. Magazine work should be arranged for several nights during the week. Select another evening as well as Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Magazine Bags in Stock</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Standards bearing the slogans suggested in Brother Rutherford’s letter of May 10, and also shown in the June, 1940, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> and the magazine bags, serve to call attention to the magazines, thus obviating our shouting loudly and otherwise creating unnecessary attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Magazine bags are again in stock. Companies and pioneers may &lt;&nbsp;i' these as needed. Fifteen cents . li; or seven for $1.00. Increase the magazine witness ; which will mean more publishers engaging in it and more hours.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">3. Coupons should be carefully counted and tied together in bundles of 100 full value coupons. Thus, 200 half value coupons should be tied together to make a bundle of 100 full value coupons. These bundles should be made up of coupons of the same brand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">4. Always state the pioneer or company account that is to be credited with the value of the coupons. Companies should be especially careful to give the name of the company that is to be credited.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Memorial First Day of Siege</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">It is with real joy that we look to the Memorial of 1940. Jehovah, through His Theocratic Government, arranges for the “Battle Siege” Testimony Period, and all of the anointed and their companions will join in this “Battle Siege” having in mind the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Refugees&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The president of the Society has been blessed of the Lord in bringing fortli the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees,</span><span class="font4"> which will greatly aid the people of good will in taking their stand. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees </span><span class="font4">is a new weapon of warfare for this “Battle Siege” Period which will expose religion and help people who love righteousness appreciate the Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ten million copies is the first printing of this new booklet, and thpse of The Theocracy should do great work in the advertising of that government through the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">World-wide Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even though our brethren in tlie war-stricken territories are unable to put in as much time as they would like to or used to in the Kingdom interests, they are, nevertheless, working with the literature that is gotten to them through great difficulty. In the last </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> it was pointed out that in October, during the “Theocracy” Testimony Period, there were 73,469 publishers in the field. It is believed that during April, May, and June, this new peak of publishers will have gone up to 100,000, because the refugees will be seeking God’s organization and taking their stand for the Kingdom and will assist in advertising The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is hoped that in the United States 10,000 more publishers will join the great multitude that is now proclaiming the message. The factory has been working day and night and week-ends in order to provide large quantities of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees for</span><span class="font4"> England, South Africa, Australia, Canada, and the isles of the sea. Translations of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font4"> have begun in many languages, and we hope that shortly these will be off the press. Everyone is pressing hard in the initial preparation for this, the greatest of all world-wide campaigns, the “Battle Siege” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tlie “Battle Siege” Testimony Period marks the spring campaign and the pressing of the siege against religion and all its allies. Because Memorial comes late in March, the spring world-wide </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign will begin with that date. March 23. This falls on a Saturday, which should give almost everyone of the Theocratic Government an opportunity to be in the service that week-end, March 23 and 24, and continue thereafter for three months. The campaign includes the “Battle Siege” Testimony Period, in April, and closes with “Locust Army” Testimony Period, in June. What a warfare for those in the Theocratic Government!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most important publication that the Lord lias given us today is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer.</span><span class="font4"> We learned last year, beginning with the campaign in January, that thousands of people were anxious to read this mag azine regularly. The special offer this year will be the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine with any book, particularly </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation, Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees,</span><span class="font4"> all on the contribution of one dollar, which is the amount usually received for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> alone. This means that tlie people will get the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer </span><span class="font4">magazine for twelve months, twenty-four issues, and, besides, will receive free a clothbound book of their choice and the new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Not 52,495 Publishers in March?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Possibilities for Many More!</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 20, “To the Publishers of The Theocracy,” provided food for serious thought for all companies and for each publisher. It seems profitable also to consider this letter from the standpoint of the country as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Checking over the reports of the company publishers in the United States, it is found that there are 73,156 persons who are associated with the organization, and only 36,323 are actively engaged in the field service. This is less than fifty percent of those associated! In addition, there are 16,172 irregular publishers, that is, publishers who are not dependable and do not get out regularly in the field. There was a peak of 46,307 publishers in the field during the past three months; that is, this number were in the field service at least once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we consider the figures above shown the force of Brother Rutherford’s further remarks is brought feel inclined to take the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">offer immediately, then present one book and a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font4"> on a contribution of 25c. If this is not accepted, then offer three booklets on a contribution of 10c, including </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees.</span><span class="font4"> Wherever the people are really interested in the Kingdom and show the spirit of good will, but are too poor to make the regular contribution, leave them </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font4"> free, or for a penny. When you do this, tell the people you will call back a little later with some more of the records and publications of the Society, and really help them to find the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This special offer of a bound book and a self-covered booklet free with a year's subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-towe.r</span><span class="font4"> applies in all languages in which </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is published. Have in mind that the regular yearly subscription rate of the magazine is asked for and they receive free a book and a booklet in their language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Campaign Will Help “Watchtower” Routes</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The magazine publishers who began the new work of distributing </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font4">February 1 will find that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign beginning March 23 will help them increase the number of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> needed in their routes. This will be an excellent opportunity for all the publishers of the Kingdom to begin routes in home to us. which is: “There must be a lack of appreciation on the part of some. Everyone who is consecrated to Jehovah, and who appreciates The Theocracy, should now be an active publisher, bending his effort to bear witness to others. Those who fail to do this fail to meet their obligations and miss many joys.” Please note that if all the regular active publishers and the 16,172 irregular publishers went out in March there would be 52,495 reporting in one month. Why can’t it be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each company should check its local figures and see to what extent it is contributing toward this delinquency as a company and see what can be done to reduce this gap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each individual should examine himself and see whether he is a regular publisher and meeting his obligations and experiencing tlie joys that may be his. The attainment of 50,000 jiublishers reporting in one month is easy if all those associated with the companies, the 73,156, begin service in March. their territory, because the publishers will be talking </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font4"> at every door they go to. If the people say they do not want </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> for a year, or cannot afford it, but would like to read it, then tell them that the provision is made for delivering the. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font4"> magazine the first and fifteenth of every month at five cents a copy and that if they cannot at the moment take advantage of the special offer of a book and booklet with tlie magazine, then you can place the book later when making regular deliveries. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font4"> routes should be greatly increased during April, May, and June of this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All will remember with what excellent success the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font4"> campaign of 1939 went over, when we had approximately 30,000 publishers in the field. Now we have well over 40,000, and look to 50,000 soon; so the quota in new subscriptions should equal that of last year's four-month campaign. It is expected that, beginning with the “Battle Siege” Testimony Period and ending with “Locust Army” Testimony Period, 100,000 new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions, in all languages, throughout the world, will be obtained. Additionally, 1,000,000 bound books, in all languages, and 12,000,000 booklets. particularly </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How can this quota be reached? Brother Rutherford, in his letter of January 20, said that the brethren in America should take advantage of the freedom we now have. He pointed out how our brethren in other lands have been working against great odds. Will the greatest portion of this quota be made up in the United States by the publishers here? It can be, if every one of the publishers diligently strives to put in his sixty hours a month and makes his twelve back-calls. If we each strive to attain to this high mark of serving the Theocratic Government, then this quota suggested by the Society for the world-wide report can easily be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">See how simple it is: One </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription per month for each publisher. That would mean, in the United States alone, well over 120,000 new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions. We should easily have these 100,000 new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions, in addition to many thousands that will be added to tlie routes which all the publishers will be building up by that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As to the books, one million copies would mean about seven a month per publisher if the United States were taking on the whole burden of 350,000 bound books per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As to tlie booklets, twelve million being the quota for tlie world, the 50,000 publishers in the United States would have to place 80 booklets a</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Watchtower</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Campaign Will Speed Up</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Route Arrangements</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The much wider distribution of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font4">magazines which began February 1 has started Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions on the most far-reaching campaign in which they have ever been privileged to participate. This magazine work will gain added impetus and tie in with the three - month world - wide campaign for new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions which begins March 23, the date for celebrating the Memorial. It is expected that by Memorial time all publishers will have engaged to some definite extent in this magazine work, either in developing a route or in street corner distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This wide distribution of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> magazines will go a long way toward bringing out into the open the “sheep” and “goat” classes, as well as proving the faith and integrity of the servants of the Lord. Since 1920 to September 30, 1939, there has been distributed throughout the world the stupendous total of 309,484,991 books and booklets. During the January campaign just ended over 500,000 bound books alone were placed. Millions of people have our literature, and a large number of them have yet to seriously look into it. One of our big tasks is to awaken the people to the necessity of reading our publications, and this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> magazine distribution will greatly aid in this respect; for it will most forcibly draw the attention of the people to Jehovah's witnesses and their part in the &quot;strange work” of advertising the Theocratic Government. So many people have told us in just so many words, if not by their actions, that what we have just told them about the Kingdom message is all very good and that they have two or three or more of our publications and they have all the intentions in the world to read them, but after we leave them their interest dies out and they permit the cares and duties of life to so envelop them that they &quot;forget” to read. Even though the witnesses come to their doors four to six times a year, this is still insufficient to get them to really read. Such people, and there are many, many thousands of them, must be reminded often in order to get them to study and from there become interested enough to want model studies in their homes and eventually become fully associated with the company. The magazine work, by means of regular routes and street cornel- distribution, is just the thing to arouse these people to action. Not only will they take and read the magazines, but they will also look into the other publications, all of which is necessary for them if they are to come from under Satan’s organization to Jehovah’s Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Distribution Has Large Potentialities</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font4">distribution work has just started and is but on a small scale as yet. Just to what extent this distribution can be increased is clearly illustrated by the work that was done in Germany in 1932 with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> magazine. With a peak of less than 15,000 publishers the brethren in Germany were distributing 4-10,000 copies of each issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> most of which were placed by means of the route method. With already 45,200 publishers (including pioneers) reporting in October, or more than three times as many publishers in the field here in the United States, it is possible for us to increase the distribution of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> to at least 500,000 copies of each issue. But, to do this, it will mean that each publisher will have to be continually on the alert to develop the magazine route in his individual territory and, as opportunity affords, get out on the street corners in the busy sections of the town whenever lie can, and especially on Saturday afternoons and evenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This wide distribution of the magazines will open the way toward getting in direct touch with the people of good will who have their permanent addresses in hotels and private or exclusive apartments, which residents up to the present time have been practically inaccessible to the publishers. A case of this kind very much to the point has just come to our attention. A person living in a hotel writes the Society, in part, as follows, in letter dated February 3: “Not more than yesterday, your magazine, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> dated January 24, 1940, came to my attention, and in looking over the same I find it is a mighty fine little magazine, and it deals with interesting facts. I have already read it to a friend of mine and he, also, proclaims it as such, too. It is too bad that this little magazine has not more publicity. It should be distributed more among workers, so they could become acquainted with what is going on.” He then orders 14 books and also subscribes for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> for one year. He additionally states, “I assure you that I will loan these books to whoever I think will be interested, and I will not be a bit surprised if they order </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> by the year, too.” For the benefit of persons similarly situated and for the welfare of all people of good will everywhere, we are determined that it can no longer be said, “It is too bad that this little magazine has not more publicity”; for from now on the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> distribution will increase to such an extent that almost everyone will know of these two magazines and that religion is the biggest of all rackets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Organize Regular Routes</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As it was successfully carried on in Germany, magazine routes must be organized in every territory and these must be served regularly without fail. Start a route even if there are only two or three persons at first. Serve these promptly and regularly, getting the magazines to them as quickly as you receive them. All people in your territory on whom you are now making back-calls or with whom you are having model studies, and who are not yet subscribers for both </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> should be on your magazine route—you will find that they will be only too glad to take advantage of this service. Another thing, don’t be satisfied to leave regularly either </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> with the people; encourage them to take </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">both</span><span class="font4"> magazines regularly. All people very much need both magazines, as well as the other helps the Society continually supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As far as possible, it would be well for the children and those who for any physical or other reason are unable to witness much from door to door to carry on this magazine route. This work must be carried on efficiently, and if a magazine publisher becomes careless or indifferent or can no longer do his job, then the one in charge of the magazine work (the advertising servant) should promptly arrange for a zealous publisher to take over the route. Iloutes should continually be on the increase, and this despite the opposition that is bound to arise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Street Corner Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This should prove to be the most interesting feature of the magazine distribution work. Care should be taken to see that every busy intersection is properly covered with magazine publishers. In every town or city schedule as many magazine publishers on the street corners as possible and at different times of the day. Also, with a number of publishers simultaneously on street corners and before railroad terminals, etc., it will greatly attract the attention of the passers-by. As has been demonstrated with the information marches, by the time the last march has gone by even the most blase have taken a folder; so, by the time the people have passed by the last magazine publisher, they will have, at the very least, been impressed that there is a magazine like </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font4">and that it is evidently backed up by a big and growing organization. This will all tend to awaken their curiosity, and when the publishers come to their doors in the regular witness work they will be found anxious to investigate further. It is therefore now advisable for all publishers, when witnessing from door to door, to carry along with them at least one or two copies of both </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation, </span><span class="font4">so as to leave them with the people who show more than the ordinary interest. From now on there will be a demand for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> magazines by the public, especially in all the territories where the route and street corner distribution is carried on on a large scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While on the street corners, the publishers should point out to the people passing by that the magazine they are offering “Exposes the religious racket”, &quot;(Publishes facts no other magazine dares to print,” is “Free of advertising”, and that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> explains The Theocratic Government”. The magazine publisher should cry out some such brief statements so as to arouse the interest of the people, and not merely stand on the corners offering the magazine at 5c a copy. By boldly advertising the high points and articles of the magazine, the publisher creates a more than ordinary interest in the magazine. We want people to know what we have; and the only way they can find out is for us to “tell” them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has already been demonstrated that it is well for the magazine publishers at street corners, and on routes, to have along with them a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> book, some booklets, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font4"> and folders containing the address of the local Kingdom hall of the company. Let each one be so supplied in order to properly satisfy the inquiry and interest of the people who ask for information about the Watchtower work, whether such people take a magazine or not. Do not enter into long discussions with the people while distributing magazines on the street corners. Neither are the magazine publishers to openly offer the other publications (books and booklets) ; for their specified job is to distribute the magazines, and these other publications are on hand only for the purpose of caring for additional interest when inquiry is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Bags</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society has magazine bags available now and is filling orders for them. They are very appropriate for this work, for use in routes and in street corner distribution. The bag has printed on both sides in two colors very attractive lettering. When you are distributing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine primarily, that being the issue of the week, then you can display the side of the bag saying, “The Watchtower explains The Theocratic Government. 50 per copy.” The reverse side of the bag can be used during the week that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> magazine, is stressed. This reads, “The Watchtower and Consolation, 50 per copy.” The word “Watchtower” has almost become a household word, and tying the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> magazine in with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> will arouse much interest in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font4">magazine as well as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer.</span><span class="font4"> In both instances the “50” is made prominent, which will show the people the price of the magazines and thus will aid in the distribution. Many will spend the nickel on curiosity and in this way may eventually obtain the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The bags are 15 cents each ; seven for one dollar, when mailed to one address. Remittance must accompany the order; they will not be charged to account. Magazine publishers should order these bags through the company servant. Each company should find out how many bags they need, and order them.</span></p>

If the names sent to the company last year have been properly filed and the back-call names from that date up to the present have been properly taken care of, each company should have an up-to-date file containing all these names. We send you each month the names of those who do not renew their subscriptions. These may be called upon, and if there is no real interest manifested your files might be adjusted by removing such names. The names of any who manifest interest and renew their subscription should, of course, be kept on file.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Calendar Pad Instructions for March</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The Calendar pad, for March, calls </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font4">attention to both the back-calls and the model studies and the scripture “Visit the fatherless and widows”. The two are directly related, for our commission from Jehovah is to “comfort all that mourn; . . . to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness ; . . . that fJehovah] might be glorified” (Isaiah 61) ; and this comforting work must be done by continually calling and back-calling on those of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the ‘widow’ organization of “Christendom”, which claims God as its Husband and Head, but which God has rejected and turned away from Him, are sincere persons to whom the word ‘widow’ might rightfully apply. Having been misled by their false shepherds, they mourn and are in great affliction and cry because of the abominations that are done in “Christendom”. These of good will in such organization of the Devil are “fatherless” because they are ignorant of God’s provision of salvation, and are suffering affliction even as the “fatherless”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is, as Brother Rutherford points out in his letters of January 1, 1939, and January 20, 1940, our privilege, obligation and joy to be used by the Lord in Informing the people of the “complete change from wicked rule to righteousness” and that “those who fail to do this fail to meet their obligations and miss many joys”. Many have thought that they were fulfilling their commission by merely placing the literature in the hands of the people. But experience has shown that many people, take the literature because they think it is so reasonably priced, or because they think it is “helping some religion along”, or to salve their conscience, and they do not appreciate the fact that the books contain information that, if properly acted upon, will result in their salvation and without which they may suffer destruction. This fact must be impressed upon them; and, as Brother Rutherford further points out, “back-calls are one of the best means of informing those who are somewhat interested of their privileges and the necessity of service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">All Publishers Can Make Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Rutherford’s letter of this January sets a new quota for the publishers of The Theocracy, namely, three back-calls per week, or twelve per month. If it took special training to do this work, then this quota would be burdensome; but anyone can make back-calls who engages in the regular door-to-door service and who appreciates the Kingdom and is anxious to advance the interests thereof. On an initial back-call a publisher should take with him his phonograph and records and play for the person one or more records. He should have sample </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation, </span><span class="font4">for calling attention to these magazines, and folder with the company address and time of meetings, and, of course, the necessary books and booklets. At this back-call he should endeavor to arrange to call back later, at which time a model study could be started. The difference between engaging in the regular field witnessing and doing back-call work is that, in the latter case, the person already has some knowledge of the Kingdom or is expecting you. You are not calling there merely to place additional literature, but your primary purpose is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4"> stimulate his interest in the Kingdom and show him his privilege of also saying “Come”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Model Studies Necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As with back-calls, so likewise any publisher can conduct model studies. The equipment necessary for this work is your phonograph with one of the series of recorded lectures, and its companion booklet and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font4"> booklet. You should have sufficient </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font4"> booklets and several Bibles with you, so that all can have a part in the study. It is in the model study that the proper groundwork is laid for one’s becoming a publisher; for the fundamental truths so necessary to a proper appreciation of one’s relationship to the Creator and to His Theocracy and the necessity of shunning religion are there clearly set forth, and the scriptures bearing on each point under discussion are read and applied for the satisfaction of the inquiring one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Start Your Own Model Study</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A very small percentage of the publishers have engaged in the model study work in the past, and, as a result, the work has not progressed as it should. Where this work has been taken up enthusiastically the Kingdom interests have advanced, to the Lord’s glory. Every publisher who makes back-calls, as well as those who have not previously done so, should enter into this model study work with the conviction that it is a provision of the Lord and therefore to be seriously considered. Why not, in addition to setting the new quota of three back-calls a week for yourself, also determine to get at least one model study a week going in your territory? Brother Rutherford’s letter urges all publishers of The Theocracy in this connection to advertise The Theocracy “by devoting more hours to the field service and endeavoring to largely increase the number of back-calls and gather together </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">groups of </span><span class="font4">interested and show them how to conduct a model study”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Expiration Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society is sending out a considerable number of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> expiration back-calls to the companies. These should be taken care of promptly and the people urged to again subscribe. As indicated on these slips, six colored-cover ■booklets may be left with such person, not associated with the organization, for whom you enter a year’s subscription, and this may be reported as a back-call and as a new subscription. If preferred, a bound book may be left in place of the six booklets. These are all good prospects for model studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Co-operation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The companies should have all back-call names in proper order and should periodically call on all those for whom they have slips in the back-call files. Where a territory remains unassigned for a period of time, back-call slips should be turned over to someone to make the back-calls, so that the files may be kept up to dt.te. Those companies whose files are up to date will be in position to notify these people by card of the Memorial celebration on March</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">23. Co-operation on the part of all publishers (ineluding pioneers) is necessary in order io keep these files in proper order. Back-Call Follow-Up Reports should be turned in promptly on all back-calls and model ' studies, and when the territory is turned in all Back-Call Slips should likewise be turned in. so as to be available when the territory is again assigned. Some pioneers still persist i in refusing or failing to report to the company the progress of their | back-call work, and we urge these to consider carefully the “Organization Instructions” under the heading “Pioneers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the convenience of those who desire.it, the Study Conductor’s Report may be used in addition to the Back-Call Follow-Up Report in the matter of reporting model studies, in this way: Always turn in a Follow-Up Report for every model study (which is, of course, also a back-call) ; where a model study lasts a month or longer, a Study Conductor’s Report should be turned in, filling in all information called for.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The King’s Memorial of Joy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">As announced by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font4">the time for the yearly feast in celebration of Jehovah’s name and to the sacrifice of the Lamb of God, Christ Jesus, is after 6 p.m. on Saturday, March 23. At that time, therefore, all companies and units of The Theocratic Government on earth will meet together for the purpose and will invite all persons of good will in their territory to attend, so these may become acquainted with the Lord’s provisions as represented in the Memorial and the reality which it prefigures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Announcements</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be entirely in order for tire one conducting (he Memorial to point out to all attending the Memorial the great privilege that is now set before the anointed as well as their companions in sharing in the vindication of Jehovah’s name; also to make announcemqnts concerning the local service arrangements, the service meetings and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies, and an invitation to take part in the “Battle Siege” Testimony Period with its special campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Send In Attendance on Report Card</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each company or unit should show on the bottom of March report card to the Society and zone servant the total number attending the Memorial and the number who partook of the emblems. Pioneers who attend Memorial with companies should make no notation on their report cards; but where isolated pioneers meet together, one of them should make such notation. Use the following method; Memorial attendance.............Number-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">partaking ............. If your company</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">attends the Memorial service of another company, then state on the bottom of your report card “In attendance with ........................................</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">company” (filling in name of company).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All who attend the Memorial should be able to obtain sufficient copies of the new booklet and such other supplies as are required to be properly equipped for the “Battle Siege” Testimony Period. The company stockkeeper, therefore, should see that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees,</span><span class="font4"> sample </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-toioer</span><span class="font4"> copies, bound books, etc., are on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Please note that you are to include on your March report card all work done during March, including your work from March 23 to 31, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">also the Memorial report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Your Plans Now to Enjoy Pioneer Service </span><span class="font4">Already in response to the January </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> for more pioneers in the spring, we have received a good number of applications for and inquiries about this very important work. The brethren who have not as yet written us about the full-time service, and who are seriously giving this matter thought, should write us about their plans as soon as possible, so that we can arrange to get them properly located by springtime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We know that there are many companies who need and would welcome pioneers in their territory. In order that we can be certain to have all these on our list, we request the company servant or zone servant on his visit to each company wanting or needing pioneer assistance to write us to that effect and to state how many pioneers they need at one time for their territory. In addition to company territory, there is much open territory for pioneers; so no one need be afraid of not getting sufficient territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is brethren who make the Kingdom interests their first interests in life that get ahead in the pioneer and company publisher service. It takes careful planning to make pioneer time; also, to reach the company publisher quota of 60 hours a month. Just how much this helps is illustrated by a letter received from two company publishers who stated, in substance, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘They first were convinced in their own minds that the “60 hours a month” quota was the Lord’s will and therefore could be accomplished, even though both were engaged in secular work. They then began to figure the best way to do His will. They decided to adopt a budget plan and to follow it regardless of any interference or opposition. They planned as follows: 7 hours every Sunday in general door-to-door work; 3 hours every .Monday night with back-calls and model studies ; 3 hours every Wednesday night in back-calling; and at least 3 hours Saturday evening. Total, 16 hours weekly; making 69 hours monthly. They do not always reach this mark, but the figure is set high as a mark toward which to aim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘They hold an Individual territory and have 55 names of interested persons on file. If there is a bad storm, they call back on these interested ones; hence it is not a hardship, no matter what the weather may be. They daily consult their schedule and try to keep ahead or at least abreast of it. When they do fall below par they put on steam and catch up even if it does mean missing a meal or getting less sleep. When the weather is fair, or on the Devil’s holidays, they make up all the extra time possible to compensate for time missed because of sickness or some other cause. By making their quota of hours—and they have thus far averaged better than 60 hours a month—they have exceeded every other quota suggested by the Society: in books, booklets, subscriptions, and back-calls. Thus proving it can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘They have signed up as magazine publishers, and look forward to February 1, when this new work begins.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Isn’t it easy to understand why these brethren succeeded? They planned carefully, and, having a true vision of the Kingdom, let nothing interfere with their plans. If each one will also take to heart the Kingdom interests the results will be proportionately greater, to the honor and praise of the Almighty Theoerat, Jehovah. Will you be a pioneer by springtime?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It Is with the keenest of pleasure we announce the excellent results which were obtained during January, a month which witnessed the severest winter weather in years. Despite this and numerous other obstacles, the publishers of The Theocbacy in America placed the astounding total of 552,178 bound books and, besides, 578,507 booklets. This surpasses by 201,002 bound books the previous record month of December with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font4">books, when at that time 290.51G books were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the companies and pioneers fairly outdid themselves during this campaign. A number of company publishers placed as high as 100 to 300 books, and there were a good many companies that averaged from 20 to as high as 45 books per publisher. The Lord certainly richly blessed every publisher who earnestly engaged in this book campaign, as these results so clearly Indicate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A very interesting fact driven home during this campaign was the great importance of having back-calls available for all kinds of weather and for special offers. The weather was so extreme everywhere that most of the publishers could</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">stand but a few hours of door-to-door witnessing; they were therefore forced to devote much of their time to making back-calls, and it was by means of these back-calls that most of the books were placed. The number of back-calls made in January by the companies was 140.-173, which Is a good average of 3.7 back-calls per month per publisher. This is an encouraging start in the right direction of three back-calls per week per publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One reason why there were not many more publishers in the field during January was that not all the publishers had back-calls to make or some failed to take advantage of the back-calls available. There were only 40.278 publishers out during January, which is 4,922 publishers under our peak of 45,200 in October. We hope that from now on all the publishers will take to heart Brother Rutherford’s timely admonition for many more back-calls and thus make it easily possible for all publishers to engage in the witness work some time during every month, regardless of weather or other conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let us now take the fullest advantage of the books placed during January by getting the people to read them. This we can best do by calling back on them, and by pressing the distribution of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> magazines.</span></p>

This is to advise that no official or other person has the right, under the guise of any kind of ordinance or law, to interfere, because (1) this work is commanded by Almighty God, Jehovah, to be done thus, and no man has authority to Interfere; and (2) the United States Supreme Court’s protection to distribution of the books and booklets, as expressed in the case of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Schneider</span><span class="font4"> vs. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Irvington, </span><span class="font4">308 U.

That’s something each publisher can strive for; but even if they don't make it, this world-wide quota will be reached, because the brethren in Canada, England, Australia, South Africa, and in war-torn Europe, and elsewhere, are all going to do their share of distributing the literature; but with the greater responsibility placed upon us here in America, and the opportunity of freedom, we can try, can’t we? It is a big quota to accomplish in</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Here’s the way the new booklet opens up:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Why are there so many people fleeing from their homes, and hunting in vain for a place of security? In ’most all the nations multitudes have been driven from their native land, and are wandering aimlessly throughout the earth. ’Most all people now seem to be in fear of losing everything they have. What are we coming to?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just those few lines from the first page of this new booklet will certainly arouse interest. The front cover itself shows these refugees from every nation, kindred and tongue on the highway—one road will lead them to destruction, and another to life. It is the great privilege now of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions to show these people the proper way, and only way to life; therefore this 64-page, self-covered booklet should be placed in every home where the people will promise to read it. The first printing Is ten million copies, and already millions of them have been sent to foreign lands where they will be distributed, and millions more are being printed for the publishers of The Theocbacy in the United States. Place just as many of these new booklets as you possibly can in the hands of the people. You will enjoy this booklet yourself; read it carefully and take it with you on all back-calls. Jehovah richly blessed Brother Rutherford In the preparation of the booklet, and great is our joy that we have the opportunity of distributing it now to the refugees.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Consignments of &quot;Refugees”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society is preparing a consignment of booklets for each company. The consignment that it is making will probably only keep the company publishers going for the first month of the campaign, because it is impossible, prior to March 23. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">for the</span><span class="font4"> factory at Brooklyn to produce all the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font4"> booklets that will be needed for the entire three months and longer. In making the consignments the Society will charge t'.', - con p uiies at a iowet rate than usual for the self-covered booklets. The pioneers also receive a special rate; and this special rate to companies and pioneers will remain in effect until the end of June. Thereafter the booklets will revert to the regular charge made companies and pioneers for self-covered booklets; therefore the companies disposing of their consignments should order early to replenish their stock and have sufficient literature on hand for the publishers to attain their quotas set out above. Keep all the publishers of the Kingdom well supplied with literature, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">sample copies, plenty of the books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation, Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font4"> and thousands upon thousands of copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As your initial consignment of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font4"> is used up, order more. Pioneers will receive no consignments ; they should order now the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font4"> needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Is your local company prepared to take care of the siege in your territory? Is each of your study conductors ready to lead into the field those attending his study and see to it that the territory around his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> study or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study is thoroughly covered with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> or some other bound book, and particularly with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees!</span><span class="font4"> Are all your interested people being furnished a copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant!</span><span class="font4"> and are you pointing out to them the importance of becoming publishers during the “Battle StiiCE&quot; Testimony Period?

<p><span class="font4">from the Society will be covered in these three months?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do you have enough </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers </span><span class="font4">to supply each of your publishers with the required number of sample copies? Do you have a good stock of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation, Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, </span><span class="font4">and of other books? Do you have plenty of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription blanks? Is your secretary prepared to send in the subscriptions the same as last year, using the Subscription Record Sheets (S-10) for the convenience of the office here? Do you keep a copy for your own files? Do you check to see that you have a back-call slip in jour file for all subscriptions sent in to the Society? Have you informed the publishers of the spe&lt; ial record which announces the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Wali-htn—' r</span><span class="font4"> magazine, the title of which is “instruction'’ (P-154)? This record is a very good one to use in obtaining </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions. Some brethren may desire a testimony card. The Society will provide these on your order. There are many things for the company servant and each one of his assistant servants to look after. Check all the details and be prepared for the “Battle Siege”. Remember, it is a battle siege that will affect every part of your territory and every publisher will be needed to make this the most successful onslaught against (he Devil’s organization and his demon-operated religious system ever carried forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As this siege is carried on against the Devil’s organization, thousands of people of good will will read of the truth and leave the prison-house of the Devil and come into the “cities of refuge&quot;. What a glorious privilege is ours during this world-wide testimony period! What a privilege is ours here in America, where we still have the freedom to go forth advertising The Theocracy ! This campaign, beginning with the Memorial, should be the greatest of all testimony periods to bring to the people the greatest offer, the message of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> a bound book, and the new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees.</span><span class="font4"> Will your company have a new peak in number of publishers? Watch your chart and compare it with last year’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign, which began in January, and keep apace; in fact, keep ahead of it. Watch your personal quota of hours in the field and of back-calls; and as this is taken care of bj’ you the final results of the “Battle Siege” will be the reach-<sup>1</sup> ing of the world-wide quota—a great ! witness to the name of Jehovah I</span></p>

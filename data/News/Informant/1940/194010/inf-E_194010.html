<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>New Record, “Message cf Hope,” to Aid Distribution</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The ''Challenge” Testimony Period. October 1 to 311 What an incentive this is to all publishers of The Theocratic Govfknment as we start the Society's new fiscal year of advertising the King and the Kingdom! All Indications point to the fact that this year's activity will be the greatest and most interesting yet known and that the month of October will witness one of the most decisive blows ever Io be handed Io the Devil and his wicked crowd who are determined to destroy God’s faithful servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To merely make the above statements doesn’t make them true, but it is now the privilege and responsibility of every supporter of The Theocracy to see to it that be makes them established facts and faithfully carries out his assigned part of God’s side of the “Challenge”. All of Jehovah’s ambassadors appreciate the meaning of the &quot;Chal-lengl&quot; and realize the importance of informing others of good will about it; therefore it is to be expected that the Lord would provide the proper equipment io use in sounding this message throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A new booklet, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy,</span><span class="font3"> which contains Brother Rutherford’s Saturday and Sunday talks given at the Theocratic Con</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Back-Calls Our Big Work</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Use “Religion” and “The End”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The new recordings “Religion&quot; ami “The End” are being shipped, and should be in use everywhere. Keep in mind that these lectures were not broadcast and the only ones who heard them were the comparatively few persons who were able to get into the eighteen convention auditoriums. Tens of thousands were turned away from these places because of lack of seating capacity. These and millions of others who have been accustomed to hearing the special lectures by radio are depending upon the publishers of the Kingdom for this information now. Every one of us must be up and doing to see that they are given this opportunity while it is possible to still continue preaching the Kingdom message in this country. You who have already heard the message know its power and its importance, and how necessary it is that those vention of Jehovah’s witnesses, will be ohered to the public for the first time beginning October 1. This booklet, together with the new book. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font3"> will be placed with the people on a 25c contribution. These two publications clearly put the issue before all persons, showing them Jehovah’s challenge and what course to take in order to have life under His righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To aid in this distribution a new record has been provided, and every Kingdom publisher owning a phonograph should have one to use in this campaign. It is “Message of Hope”, B-2311. and Part II of &quot;The End”, P-229. Use it extensively I It has been suggesled that those not taking a combination of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Ayainst Democracy</span><span class="font3"> on a 25c contribution be offered a 10c combination of three booklets, namely, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees, Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font3"> (or any other three-booklet combination including </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy).</span><span class="font3"> If not agreeable to that, the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy</span><span class="font3"> A </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">g a i n s t Democracy </span><span class="font3">should be left with the party on any contribution, or free where they cannot afford a small contribution and yet really want to read the booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Preparation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By this time all arrangements should have been made for a successful campaign in your company. It is necessary that the company servant co-operate with all servants regardwho have not heard this message be given an opportunity to hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This wonderful fall weather should not be wasted, but should be utilized to the glory of the Lord, ami. in addition to the various other features of the Kingdom work, back-calls should be made on the people now with these new series of recordings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every publisher, of course, is going to have the special record P-229, P-230 (“Message of Hope”), so as to properly introduce the Kingdom message to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord is evidently maneuvering the enemy so that it has been possible for Jehovah’s witnesses to obtain more publicity during the past few months than we had ever received in the past. This is, undoubtedly. going to create a certain amount of curiosity in the minds of many people. Your back-call will help these folks out. They will want to know more about Jehovah's witnesses and the Kingdom message they present to the people. It is up to the publishers to take advantage ing the “Challenge&quot; Testimony Period. and particularly the stockkeeper, territory serrant and the back-call servant, to see that sufficient supplies of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font3"> are on hand for every publisher. Each publisher should be able to place at least five of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> and 50 copies of the new booklet in the hands of the people during the month. All thickly settled territory should be thoroughly covered during the campaign and all goodwill interest called upon at least once during the month. Companies not yet receiving their new literature should go right ahead with what books and booklets they have on hand, not letting any time slip by in which a witness can be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Testimony Cards</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is consigning a new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Religion)</span><span class="font3"> testimony card to all companies, and this should be used during the campaign. Pioneers will receive theirs with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font3">This initial supply should be preserved : there will be no reprinting of this testimony card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having all things in readiness, and determined, by the Lord’s grace, to put forth greater effort than ever before, all servants of the Most High will go forward during the &quot;Challenge” Testimony Period declaring themselves entirely against all wicked schemes of the Devil and wholly on the side of The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Our Year’s Kingdom Work</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Now that our new fiscal year is starting, all companies will wish to prepare a chart to indicate the progress being made by the company. A sample of such chart was set out in the October. 1939, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant;</span><span class="font3"> however, the current chart should have an additional space for “Individual Magazines&quot;. We look forward to this year with joy and seek Jehovah's guidance in our Theocratic service I of this situation. Even though in practically all cases those writing the news articles for the public press do it with the intent of misrepresenting and ridiculing the Kingdom work. Ihose people of good will who are hungering and thirsting after righteousness will be able to get sufficient out of it to make them want to know more. The Lord assures us that He will even cause the wrath of men to praise Him. Let us, therefore, give great diligence to the back-call work during this fall with this new series of records. We hope to have something more definite for you on the model studies with these recordings at a later date.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>How to Place 100-Pound Orders</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Combine Orders</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">On the first page of the Cost List there is set forth instructions on ordering, including how to estimate 100-pound orders. All company servants, stockkeepers and pioneers should be well acquainted with these instructions. Inasmuch as we ship the orders from the factory in the most economical way, which is by freight, it must be remembered that orders weighing less than 100 pounds cost the same amount to ship as those that weigh 100 pounds. This means careful planning, so that it can be determined when to order (and to estimate 100-pound orders) efficiently. If every company would keep a progressive inventory it would enable them to know well in advance just what stock will be needed. Small companies that cannot place 100-pound orders should also carefully arrange their orders, so that they will need to make up only one order about every two months. Pioneers working with companies (especially small companies) can make arrangements with the company servants to combine their orders; meaning that the pioneer can include his order in the same envelope with that of the company, with instructions that the orders be shipped together. This will greatly aid in making 100-pound orders. Following the above rules will save the Society money, which can be used to further advance the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font3"> is now being mailed out, a limited edition having been printed. This is a splendid journal for all Kingdom publishers to now use extensively, while it is fresh, having in mind the back-call work in particular. The people of good will on our back-calls, having heard the new series of records, which are the best that have ever been made, will be so inspired that they will want to have a complete report on the greatest Theocratic convention ever held on earth. Now the back-call work is being intensified, and all should possess a copy of this magazine. It will enable them to visualize the magnitude of the publishing of the Kingdom message and the unity in action of the Lord’s people. Therefore, order more of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font3"> now, while there is still a supply on hand. They are 10c a copy, and a remittance should accompany your order.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The Inventory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Each pioneer and company is being furnished two Inventory blanks. You will note that these should be made out and one copy sent in to the Society by October 1. As indicated elsewhere in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font3">we are preparing for a mammoth distribution of booklets during December; and it is therefore imperative that we receive the Inventory blank promptly, so that we can determine the quantity of booklets on hand throughout the country. Your copy will be valuable in determining your needs for making up combinations and, maybe, using some of your stock to supply other companies or pioneers.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>A Suggestion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Many of the brethren have found it profitable to review </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoner</span><span class="font3"> of September 15, 11)39. and of November 1, 1939. These two articles can be read with real profit, considering carefully all scriptures set forth therein.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Courage” Testimony Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Three Million Booklets to Go Out</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Check Your Stock Now, and Plan</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">By the time December rolls around we shall have had four months in which to offer the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion, </span><span class="font3">and the results will probably show that this book has had a wider distribution than any other one book in the same period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">December has always proved to be a good month in which to make a “special offer”; and so again it will be set aside for that purpose. Seven booklets on a 25c contribution, or three on a 10c contribution, has always been considered a good offer, in view of the fact that most publications of that size generally “sell” at ten cents or more per copy. But now, for the month of December, all precedents are shattered, as we make available </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">seven</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ten cents,</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">three</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">five cents;</span><span class="font3"> booklets that answer practically any question a reasonable-minded person can ask. This offer should certainly “take”, and every publisher of The Theocracy should make upward of ten placements of seven booklets during the period.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Take Subscriptions for Magazines Published, Only</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">For the information of all publishers :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Due to the war, some of the Society’s magazines have been discontinued. The Society at Brooklyn continues to mail out regularly the following magazines:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower:</span><span class="font3"> English, Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Ukrainian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation:</span><span class="font3"> English, Greek, Portuguese, Spanish, Ukrainian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do not take subscriptions for any other languages. Those brethren who have subscribed for magazines no longer mailed out may have their subscriptions transferred to the English edition or any other language at the moment available.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">All Should Carry the Magazines</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is not at all sufficient for the magazine publishers to have a good supply of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> magazines. All publishers should take along a supply of these magazines with them when they go out in the field or on back-calls. Each time a publisher goes out witnessing he should take along at least two copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font3"> or of both. Every Kingdom publisher should become </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower-</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> - conscious. Discuss this at your service meetings, and let the advertising servant order sufficient magazines to care for the needs of the entire company. Each company should be ordering at least two copies of each magazine for every regular publisher, besides the number of copies required by the magazine publishers. Take this all into consideration, and increase your distributors’ order accordingly. This is, without doubt, the most important work we have ever undertaken. Let us show we appreciate the great importance of this work by wholeheartedly engaging in it. We know the Lord’s rich blessing and favor is upon this magazine distribution; for His due time is here to gather together the great</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to be able to make such a generous offer to the people, all company publishers will be charged at one cent each for all booklets, colored-cover and self-covered, English and foreign. The companies will, on application to the Society, be allowed a rebate on all colored-cover booklets used from their stock. Everything in stock should be moved out!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If we are to place three million booklets with the people, it means that proper advance preparations must be made by all companies and pioneers, so that all will be adequately supplied for the campaign. Your Inventory will have been taken and you will know what you have on hand and what additional booklets you will have to order to care for your needs. If you act promptly, we shall be able to get these to you well in advance of the December campaign. With the September statement, which will be mailed out about October 10, will be sent more details and a special order blank which you will use in acquainting us with your booklet needs. Do some planning now for the December, “Courage” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Special Notice</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Neutrality</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Advice for Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font3"> were furnished to all publishers free, by the Society through the company organization. Some publishers have been careless and misplaced their copies of these booklets and have asked the company servant for a new supply. The Society cannot continue to furnish these booklets free. Anyone wanting extra copies can place an order through the company at 5c a copy, as long as they last. Remittance must accompany order.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Mail</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The Canadian Post Office advises the United States Post Office Department that an order has been issued in Canada prohibiting the delivery of all mail addressed to or coming from the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society in Canada. We advise that the American brethren no longer write to persons in Canada concerning the activity of Jehovah's witnesses, as it is prohibited.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>November Witness</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Due to the rush of work here, not all companies and pioneers will receive their supply of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font3"> new records or the new booklet for use in October. By November 1, however. probably every publisher in the country will have available to him all the new literature and records. So continue throughout November with the same campaign as outlined for October. There can be no slacking now in the zeal of the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">multitude of people of good will. Truly our hearts rejoice in the salvation of Jehovah, and it is therefore with much joy that all those who have a vision of The Theocracy press on in the wonderful work now set before them.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Feed the Multitude</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord Jesus gave the commission to Peter, and which extends to the remnant and their companions, the Jonadabs: “Feed my sheep.” That commission is not fulfilled by merely placing the literature, containing the spiritual food made available by the Lord, in the hands of the people. In order that those of good will may assimilate that food and take their place in the &quot;cities of refuge”, studies must be arranged for their benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Model Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Rutherford, in his letter of January 20 of this year, emphasized back-calls and model studies as being “one of the best means of informing those who are somewhat interested of their privileges and the necessity of service”. And so </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">every publisher,</span><span class="font3"> in order to help fulfill his commission, should determine to immediately arrange for, and conduct, model studies in his individual territory. The publisher should let the people in his territory know that he is interested in their acquiring an accurate knowledge of Jehovah's provisions and that he will be glad to go over with them any questions they may have. A long discussion is unnecessary (and usually out of place) at the initial call when the literature is left. But every placement of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> should be made the occasion for a back-call with the ultimate object in mind of starting a model study ; and this can easily be done if the new record “Message of Hope” (P-230) is used when the literature is introduced. Let each publisher set the quota of. and continuously care for, one model study and two more back-calls per week. The company should set its quota accordingly. The company, and back-call servants should assist every publisher in starting a model study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Religion” Book Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As indicated In November, 1939, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> book studies should be established at strategic places throughout the company territory and such be used as study and service headquarters, under the direction of the study conductor and company servant. The study conductor should follow closely the instructions contained on Study Conductor’s Report, except that hereafter the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> will not be available for distribution. (See notice elsewhere concerning this.) The publishers attending these studies and living in the territory assigned to them should recognize their responsibility of attending the studies and co-operating in every way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is proper that such study groups use the latest book publications of the Society. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> has been the book so used. Now that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> is available, this will be used where </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> has been covered once. All new studies established should use </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Watchtower” Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of course, every company should have a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study and service meeting at its headquarters, and all those conducting model and book studies should always mention these at their studies and if possible arrange to bring the newly interested there.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Supplies and Report Cards</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">A year’s supply of Report cards, with a letter of instruction on reporting, and three Pioneer Daily Record Sheets, will be sent to each pioneer on or about October 1. Also, and at the same time, each company will be sent a year’s supply of Report cards, with a letter of instruction on reporting, and one Company </span><span class="font4">Monthly Record Sheet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Be a Publisher</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Plan Now for Biggest Month</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">For the month of I lecember, “Courage” Testimony Period, the Lord 1ms opened the way for a tremendous witness with booklets. Now tiie opportunity is here for the biggest booklet month, and each and every one will embrace it witli enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All publishers realize that these booklets contain food convenient provided by the Lord and essential for the welfare of the people. The message contained in these booklets plays a very powerful and vital part in the great drama of vindication now going on; consequently they should be in the hands of the people, and not on book shelves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Good-Will People</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Undoubtedly there are thousands among the good - will names, and those attending model studies, and even attending company meetings and going out in tlie service, who have not read the very important message contained in many of these older booklets, such as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Angels, Intolerance, Dividing the People, The Crisis,</span><span class="font5"> and numerous other booklets. All of these persons should read these booklets. Therefore see that these booklets are made available to every person of good-will associated with the company or in your back-call file; 7 on a 10c contribution, 17 on a 25c contribution, or even 35 on contribution of 50c. What an offer!!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to these, the message must be placed in the hands of the tens of thousands of other people of good-will whose names are not now on our files. Therefore each and every one should take advantage of this splendid opportunity to push this booklet campaign with vigor and enthusiasm. The time is short. The amount of work to be done is great. Therefore let each one do his part in devoting as much time and effort as possible to this campaign. Take care of your part of the quota!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the latest inventory sheets there are more than ten million booklets in the hands of the companies and pioneers throughout the country. These should be placed with the people quickly. The campaign includes both English and foreign-language booklets, so that everyone can participate in it and every type of territory can be thoroughly worked, morning, afternoon and night, seven days a week. These booklets are to be placed at 7 on a contribution of 10c; or where the people are unable to make a tencent contribution, 3 booklets may be offered on a 5c contribution, or one on any contribution the people are able tto offer. Don’t forget, too, 17 booklets on a contribution of 25c, or 35 on a 50c contribution; try it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>on 10c Contribution!</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This is a real booklet campaign; let’s do all we can in the interests of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If each of the 50,000 company publishers will place 10 combinations of 7 booklets during the month, that will take care of 31 million of the 10 million booklets now in the hands of the companies. Can the company publishers do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneers, of course, will enthusiastically participate in this campaign also, although provisions are made for them to Include other literature where desirable. Each pioneer will try to average 5 combinations, or 35 booklets, per day. 3,800 pioneers, putting in full time, should place about 3,000,000 booklets themselves. Therefore there seems to be no reason why, between the companies and pioneers, at least 5 million of the 10 million booklets now on the shelves of the companies and pioneers cannot be disposed of during tlie “Courage” Testimony Period. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy </span><span class="font5">booklet may be included in each combination of the older booklets placed. It will be of Interest to see if the 3,800 pioneers will place as many booklets as the 50,000 company publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Careful Planning</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The company servant should check up as instructed in tlie other correspondence sent to him and see that there is sufficient literature on hand to make up the quota of combinations for the publishers in your company. That would mean sufficient booklets for 10 combinations for each publisher. Accept this as the Lord’s direction in the matter and see that that many booklets are on hand. Some servants think their judgment in matters of this nature is better than that of tlie Lord through his organization and they refrain from ordering sufficient stock, and, as a rule, the stock they have on hand is disposed of before the campaign is half over and the rest of the month they just indifferently plod along with anything they can make up. With the large number of booklets available for this campaign there is no excuse for anything like this to happen now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Checking Progress</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An accurate check should be kept of the progress of the work each week. At the end of the first week an average of 3 combinations per publisher should be in evidence, and if the company is falling behind in their quota an effort should be made to ascertain the cause and overcome it. Similarly, by the end of two weeks an average of 5 combinations per publisher should be placed; and by the end of 3 weeks, 8 combinations. By watching the progress in this manner results can and will be obtained. By the end of the month each company should have a new peak in publishers, showing their “courage” in giving the testimony, and all average the 10 combinations. What will your company do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These booklets are to be supplied by the companies to tlie publishers, from the stockroom, at 1c each. This includes self - covered and coloredcover booklets, and applies to both English and foreign languages. The kind of booklets to comprise each combination will be determined by the stock that is available in the company; consequently each publisher should co-operate with the stockkeeper and the other company servants in disposing of the booklets that are in the company’s stock. Generally speaking, 4 colored-cover booklets and 3 self-covered booklets will comprise a combination. However, if there is a large supply of self-covered booklets on hand and not so many colored-cover, the number may be changed to 4 selfcovered and 3 colored-cover booklets. Adjust the combinations to dispose of your local stock first. Additional supplies may be obtained from the Society to make up combinations. Instructions regarding this are supplied the company servant and stockkeeper; also, the servants are receiving full information regarding the adjustment of the account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following suggestion is made in the interests of a wider distribution of the booklets. Those companies west of the Rocky Mountains should feature </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People Angels, Uis 'Works, Uis Vengeance, Beyond the Grave, Supremacy, Intolerance, Righteous Ruler,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis,</span><span class="font5"> of all of which we have a good supply in that territory. Those in the vicinity of the St. Louis and Brooklyn depots should emphasize </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Safety, Government-Hiding the Truth: Why?</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis, Intolerance, Angels,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">December can be made a month wherein the Devil's crowd can see the courage of the Lord's people despite all opposition.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Yearbook</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Calendar</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">The 1941 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s ■witnesses</span><span class="font5"> and the Calendar are being prepared. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> contains the complete report, written by Brother Rutherford, of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses for the past year, which will be a joy to everyone. The Calendar contains the text for 1941: “ ‘Salvation unto our God . . . and unto the Lamb.’ —Rev. 7: 10.” Both of these should be in every home where they will be a comfort to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> can be had on a contribution of 50c; and the Calendar, 25c (in lots of five or more, to the same address, 20c each). Orders for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> and the Calendar should be placed through the company servant. For the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font5">and the Calendar, company servants should send their orders in to the Society around December 1.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>1941 Quota</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">I 5 Million Hours</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Average 60,000 Publishers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has poured out a rich blessing upon His people during the past year. The greatest amount of work ever accomplished in the United States was done during the past twelve months. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> now being prepared, will give you the president’s report of the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world, which, of course, will include that of the United States. At this time we look forward to the work ahead compared to that which has been accomplished in the way of publishers and their hours in the field. During the past year there was an average of 47,702 company publishers and pioneers in the field service every month. In the United States we reached a peak of 58,009 in June. The peak that we were aiming at for the year, of 50,000, was surpassed. Many of the “great multitude” saw the responsibility and joined in singing the new song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This group of publishers put in more than 121- million hours in the field service. The company publishers averaged 15.9 hours per month, and the pioneers 111.9 hours per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is estimated that during 1941, having in mind a like increase over the previous year, there will be an average of 56,500 company publishers in the field and, on the average, 3,500 pioneers and zone servants reporting regularly. The above total of 60,000 publishers for the United States is an average we hope to attain for the twelve months of 1941; but, as a peak for the year, it is expected there will be 70,000 publishers proclaiming the Kingdom message. That will mean that every company organization will strive diligently to increase their number of publishers approximately 25 percent over their peak for 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Hours</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having in mind what the publishers have been doing in the past, it is believed that, with 60,000 publishers (3,500 of these being pioneers), a total of 15,500,000 hours will be spent in tlie proclamation of the Kingdom in 1941. By the Lord’s grace that amount of time can be spent in field service and will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every person interested in The Theocracy should strive diligently to be a publisher and then do all within his power to put in as many hours in the field as possible and strive toward that quota of 60 hours per company publisher or of 150 hours per month for pioneers, having in mind, too, the 12 back-calls per month per publisher. Publishers, hours and back-calls should be kept prominently before the minds of the brethren throughout the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the publishers of the Kingdom put in a total of 15,500,000 hours, then it can be expected that upward of 2 million bound books will be placed in the field, 15,000,000 book-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column</span><span class="font5"> 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In these days of great distress and perplexity the new booklet, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied,</span><span class="font5"> is something that people of good-will will want to read and study.

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Have You Shared in the Proclamation?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> will set out the detailed report of what was accomplished in the United States, but sufficient to say now is that the greatest number of publishers ever to engage in the field service in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">U. </span><span class="font5">S. A. were privileged to share in that blessed work during 1940. In the United States alone there was a monthly average of 47,762 publishers engaging In the field service. The company publishers averaged 15.9 hours, and the pioneers 111.9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What are the publishers of the Kingdom going to average during 1941? It will be interesting to watch your Kingdom activities chart from month to month. Our prayer is that all the brethren will take advantage of all the opportunities now extended to them; first, of being a publisher and putting time in the field, making back-calls, arranging model studies, carrying on the magazine work, engaging in the door-to-door witness with the phonograph, attending the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study regularly, as well as service meetings, and arranging for sufficient studies for all the people of good-will in the territory. Jehovah richly blessed the Theocratic arrangements of last year, and we look forward to 1941 for His guidance and direction under the Theocratic arrangement.</span></p>

The purpose of this work is to prepare the territory for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> Campaign, which will begin on February 1. Each company and pioneer should select for the month of January a certain portion of the territory which they expect to cover thoroughly, beginning February 1, for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscriptions. You will appreciate the need of this arrangement after you read the new booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied.</span><span class="font5"> It is a splendid booklet to prepare the minds of the people for the reading of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font5">and the booklet properly distributed</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Hundreds of Thousands of Foreign Booklets Can Be Placed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">A definite part of the “Coubage” Testimony Period, during December, will be getting out the Kingdom message in their own tongue to the people of good-will who do not understand the English language so well. There are people of this type in practically every company and pioneer territory. Some of these have never had a fair opportunity to receive the message of the Kingdom because the majority of the publishers have carried with them only English literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to properly carry on the work of “Courage” Testimony Period each company and pioneer should determine to make the message available to these foreign-language territories, so that the people therein may know of the Kingdom and its attendant blessings. Quickly determine what languages are required and approximately how many booklets can be used, and send in your order promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the larger companies have a good supply of the foreign booklets on hand, and should embrace this opportunity of getting them out into the hands of the people of good-will. Special arrangements should be made to cover tlie foreign-language territory thoroughly, possibly by group witnessing. Set at least one weekday aside during each week of the month for that purpose. All foreign booklets, including the old-style, large booklets, will be offered on the same contribution as the English, namely, combination of 7 on a contribution of 10c, or 3 on a 5c contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are approximately three-fourths of a million foreign booklets in the hands of the companies and pioneers. Place them with the people. The zone servants know of foreign territories in their zones, as well as the quantity of such literature in the hands of the companies. They can materially assist in getting these booklets where they are needed.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Lost and Found</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">There are a few articles left over from the Detroit convention &quot;Lost and Found” department for which we have received no inquiry. Anyone who lost any articles at the convention, please write the Society regarding them; they may be on hand here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Considered Pioneer Service? </span><span class="font5">throughout the territory means that the people in your territory will also expect you to engage in magazine street work at definite hours each week. The booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font5"> will be a very good publication to discuss carefully at your service meeting. Portions of it can be discussed on various evenings prior to January 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Consignments</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Should the company want a few copies immediately for their own use amongst the brethren they can order them right now at five cents a copy. Consignments will be made to all company organizations throughout the country so that you will have them by January 1, 1941. Pioneers will not receive a consignment, but should order them and engage in a similar campaign. The details of this campaign will be furnished later.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Special Wrapper to Aid Booklet Distribution</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">To assist all Theocratic ambassadors in placing booklets in the hands of the people during December, the Society has printed and is consigning a special wrapper which is to be used in making up packets of seven booklets eacli for the “Courage” Testimonj' Period. Since the offer during this campaign is seven booklets on a 10c contribution, these convenient and attractive wrappers will greatly aid all Kingdom publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All companies are being sent a consignment on the basis of 10 wrappers to each regular publisher, while pioneers will be sent 100 each. Please do not order any extra wrappers, as only one printing was made. Each company can make their own arrangements for pasting this wrapper together. It may be suggested that several get together and complete the entire company consignment and have the wrappers all ready for the publishers when they get their supply of booklets. A pasting mark has been printed on the wrapper so that all will be uniform. Giving the booklets a slight bend will aid in putting them in the wrapper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This bright-colored wrapper bears a testimony on the front and back sides and will be handy for reading however picked up. The top and the bottom booklet can be placed face out, thus providing further testimony from either side.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Your Orders</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Some companies have written in saying they have not received their </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font5"> booklets or their new records. We feel sure that all companies will receive their supplies during the month of November. We are still several weeks behind on orders, due to the failure of the manufacturers of the records to supply them fast enough. It is believed that within the next ten days the manufacturers of the records “Religion” and “The End” will have sufficient supplies delivered to us to fill all back orders except those being filled from the West Coast depot. We appreciate very much the hearty co-operation on the part of all of the brethren in being patient and waiting until they have received their orders. During the last month we have shipped out from the Brooklyn office more than 230,000 bound books and 3,800,000 booklets. In fact, it was everything that we manu</span><span class="font4">factured. We hope to catch up soon.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Use Your Sound Equipment!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">“And seven priests, bearing seven trumpets . . . went on continually, and blew with the trumpets.” (Joshua 6: 13) That is the text for this month in the 1940 Calendar. Here and also in Joel 2:9 Jehovah foretold the great work that would be carried on by his organization at the present time by means of the sound equipment, and which is so vividly set forth In the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> in the chapter “United Servants”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has provided his servants with the splendid new recordings, “Message of Hope” to aid in distributing the literature and arranging for back-calls, and the two new series “Religion” and “The End” for use in the back-call work. All publishers of Tlie Theocracy should put this equipment to good use at every opportunity. During November the same offer will be used as that for the month of October, the latest book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font5"> and the new booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy,</span><span class="font5"> on a contribution of 25c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Setups</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the use of the phonograph in the door-to-door witness work (always being ready to make a doorstep setup) it would be entirely ineffective and improper In introducing the recorded lecture by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">asking </span><span class="font5">the person who answers the door if he would like to listen to the message of the Kingdom. In answer they would most likely say “No”, or “I am not Interested”. On the contrary, words to this effect should be used: ‘I have a very interesting message on this record, which you will be glad to hear, I am sure’; and then set the needle down on the record immediately ; thus doing our utmost to enable the people to have every opportunity to hear the good news of The Theocracy. At the command of the Lord through Joshua, the priests of tlie Israelites sounded the trumpets, and did not ask for permission to do so, but went straight ahead, trusting in Jehovah. This does not mean that we should be rude and try to force the people to hear the message, but Instead, if one refuses to hear the record further, we should politely withdraw immediately and use our time only to seek those who are of goodwill and who desire to know the way of escape and safety. “And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” (Rev. 22:17)</span></p>

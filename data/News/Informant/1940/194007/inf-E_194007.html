<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>That’s the Title of a New 32-Page Booklet Released July 13</span></h3>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2,000,000 First Printing</span></h5>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>To Be Distributed in 10 Days</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah's witnesses in the United States have encountered an intense wave of persecution on every side. A few weeks ago, in Texas, organized moiis. formed at the instance of the Hierarchy to “get” Jehovah’s witnesses, went into action. Since then magazine publishers have been stormed on street corners by mobs and run out of town; automobiles have been upset, and run into lakes; officers of the law have protected the mobsters and incarcerated Jehovah’s witnesses. Jehovah’s witnesses’ halls have been burned, people have been dragged out of their homes, many have been put in jail without trial or just complaint; no one has been allowed to see them. They have not even been permitted to communicate with a lawyer. Zone assemblies have been broken up; decrees set forth by city officials that no longer may Jehovah’s witnesses meet in halls; conventions canceled, and brethren being ordered out of the state. These conditions have prevailed in many states in the Linion. The same Nazi, Fascist, Catholic Hierarchy method is being used in this country to stop the witness work as has been used throughout Europe. The Hierarchy declared years ago that 1940 was their year to take America. They are trying to do it through mob action. The time has come for them to strike and they are stinking. The only organizal ion on earth today that is completely free from their influence is Jehovah's Theocratic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Do</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the privilege and responsibility of the Lord’s people to reveal the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in all its hideousness so that reasonable-minded people of good will may be able to distinguish between what comprises the Lord’s organization and what constitutes the Devil’s organization and make an intelligent choice. The booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Judge Rutherford Uncovers l-'iflh Column</span><span class="font3"> is unquestionably the divinely provided instrument for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are not going to try to describe the contents of this booklet for you. We could not do justice to it if we tried. Read it yourself and receive the thrill of your life. Then go forward and put it out in the strength of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If ever Jehovah’s witnesses were required to put on a strenuous campaign it is now. and, by the Lord’s grace, they shall not be found wanting. Jehovah’s witnesses know full well that Jehovah, through His King, Christ Jesus, is directing His Theocratic organization and instructing</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DIFFICULTIES</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">Brother Rutherford made the following statement the other day:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“1 am sure the difficulties that the Lord has permitted the enemy to bring upon His people He will cause to work to His own glory. We have the assurance that all things shall work together for our good and doubtless the great opposition will bring the Lord's wit-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">His people through His organization. Therefore they obey with gladness of heart and ready hand. The Society's factory at Brooklyn is working day find night printing this new 32-page booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The booklet is being consigned to companies on the basis of from 20 to 40 booklets per publisher. Each publisher in the company should get his supply on or before Friday night, July 12. A special meeting should be arranged by the company servant lor that night, that tinal preparations for this campaign may be completed and publishers receive their literature, assignment of territory and final instructions. Go forth into the field Saturday and Sunday and let those who wish to know read I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This booklet is to be placed on a contribution of be a copy or whatever contribution the people are able to make; and if they are too poor to contribute but really manifest interest and want a copy, leave it with them free. Take their name and arrange for a back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Host publishers should be able to dispose of their allotment of booklets in a few days’ time and then help those who may be unable to handle all of theirs. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">This work of placing the first two million booklets is very important.</span><span class="font3"> It is essential that we get going quickly ; and when your supply is placed, order more for the rest of your territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fight is on 1 Let the Catholics carry on their mob action and try to stop Jehovah's witnesses 1 We do not fear them! We know that Jehovah God is maneuvering the enemy as well as his own organization and will fully back up His work. It is our great privilege now to show what &quot;Theocratic action”, inspired by the spirit of the Lord, can do. Let each one give all diligence in covering the territory with this message, regardless of the cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Consignments</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These 2,999,009 booklets are being consigned to nil companies. Pioneers working in company territory, if they hate not received any, should get their supply from the company, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">remitting direct to the company for the number they obtain.</span><span class="font3"> We hope to have the consignment in the hands of every company by July 12. If you should not receive yours until a day </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">nesses more prominently to the front. It will also make the enemy more prominently against them, and this will have much to do with dividing the people. The Lord’s children should be encouraged by these circumstances, rather than discouraged. I am sure they will rejoice to bear any burdens that come upon them, which the Lord permits, and which will redound to His praise and glory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">or so later, have your special meeting and all preparations made and go to work as soon as your supply arrives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers who have orders now being filled from Brooklyn office will find that such orders will be Increased by 100 copies of this new booklet. Pioneers in isolated territory should order as many as they can use immediately. These booklets will be charged on company and pioneer accounts alike at Ic a copy.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A Petition Sweeps the Country</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h6><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>“Locust Army” Period Winds Up with Swift Action</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">It came as a shock and great surprise to all the publishers of the Kingdom that the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses might not be held In the Ohio State Fair Grounds because of the cancellation brought about by the politicians in charge under pressure from the Catholic Hierarchy. Not only on Columbus was the strenuous opposition by the Catholic Hierarchy brought to bear, to stop this convention, but also In many other parts of the country. It was necessary to take legal action to try to counteract their influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Preparations for the convention are going on, however, and it is a source of real joy to all who have a share therein. Never before has there been so much opposition to the preparations for any assembly of the Lord's people. The Devil knows his time is short, and he Is “out to get” Jehovah’s witnesses, but, by the Lord’s grace, he shall not be victorious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Brother Rutherford authorized a petition sent out, first in Ohio, the brethren went into the work with a zeal peculiar to the Lord's house. Mobs were formed in many parts of the state. Petitions were taken away from the brethren and torn, in some places. This, however, in no wise intimidated them; they went forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Following close on the heels of the petition to the State of Ohio, Brother Rutherford authorized a country-wide petition sent out. The As soon as the company can send in the contribution received for these booklets more of them can be printed. When your supply of this booklet is exhausted and more are needed to cover your territory, place an order immediately. We will try to fill it as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time has come to inform the people of these momentous events. Brother Rutherford has given the public press an opportunity to so Inform the people, but up to this time they have refused. The booklet will tell why. All who are on the side of the great King will enjoy to the full this new booklet and will express to the Lord their appreciation of being allowed to have some part in its distribution. Press on in this battle, putting your full trust in Jehovah, having full assurance that “to Jehovah belongeth salvation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">brethren throughout the land were thrilled. As soon as the companies received their sample copies of the petition and letter of instructions a great many of them began mimeographing forms so that they could start to work Immediately and later use up the regular petition forms which were coming to them by mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A total of more than 160,000 petition blanks have been sent out from here, in addition to all the homemade ones. This would be sufficient for over three million names. If half of these are filled in, what a wonderful witness against the rulers it will be! Scores of telegrams and hundreds of air mail and special delivery letters have been received stating that all blanks are filled and more are needed. The results of this work have been unparalleled. It is evidently the Lord's doing, and marvelous in our eyes. You will be advised of the results of the campaign after the presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time spent in obtaining petition signatures should be counted as hours in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Record of Petition Signers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the petition sweeps the country it is encountering considerable vicious opposition from the enemy, showing tli at those who do sign it are people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A list should be made of all petition signers and placed in the company's back-call file. All of these people will want to hear the series “Religion as a World Remedy” as soon as it is available. Therefore make a list of the names of all petition signers for that purpose.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">100,000 Subscriptions by Convention Tune! </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Make Your Quota of Books?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>One Thousand New Pioneers by Convention!</span></h4>
</div><br clear="all">
<h6><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>New Booklet Will Help on Your Booklet Quota</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">Ilie special offer of a year's subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine, a bound book and a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees </span><span class="font3">booklet, on a contribution of $1.00 ends July 23. The importance of the people’s having this literature now, of all times, cannot be overemphasized. This is one of the reasons why the publishers of The Theocracy are anxious to do everything in their power to persuade as many people as possible to subscribe now. We realize that all people who love righteousness and hate lawlessness must quickly take their stand on the Lord’s side if they are to receive his protection in Armageddon; for, as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoivcr</span><span class="font3"> and the physical facts clearly indicate, the “strange work’’ is rapidly coming to a close. It is only by studying the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine and kindred publications that they can get the needed life-giving knowledge. There is no other source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the 50,000 and more publishers of The Theocracy should, during the remaining days of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign, earnestly push this special offer. Between now and convention time each publisher should make it his or her business to get one more subscription, and so help us to go over the top of our worldwide quota of 100,000 new subscriptions. Even while distributing the latest booklet, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Judge Rutherford Uncovers fifth Column,</span><span class="font3"> keep your “eyes wide open” and grasp every chance</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>“More Publishers”</span></h4>
<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>July a Month for a New Peak</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">The Calendar pad, for July, focuses our attention on the fact that all brethren associated with the Lord’s organization should now without fail be in the Held service each month. In other words, this means more publishers. It further points out that this increase in activity cannot come by conscription or force: it must be an entirely voluntary offering of one’s self as clearly indicated in the text. &quot;Thy people will freely offer themselves in the day of thine army.”—Psalm 110: 3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You will rejoice to know that in the month of Slay in the United States alone there were 51,740 publishers in the held. Jehovah’s people have looked forward to the time when we would have over 50,000 publishers in the field in the United States. We sill greatly rejoice in the fact that we ha\e arrived at that time. The persecution forced on Jehovah's witnesses throughout the United States by the Hierarchy has had an effect the very opposite of what they anticipated. Many of our brethren have been forced out of their secular employment. Instead of sitting down and bemoaning their fate they immediately made application for pioneer service, determining from hence forth to find employment in The Theocracj where neither man nor devil can force them out. We feel sure that, despite all the efforts of the Hierarchy and the rest of the Devil’s organization to the contrary, the month of June will show a very definite increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the brethren joyfully participated in the petition work. Many brethren who never participated in the work before have joyfully undertaken this. to make known to all those who show unusual interest in the message the special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> offer. Many additional subscriptions can be so obtained, if the brethren will only be on the alert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are behind in our world-wide quota of subscriptions, bound books and booklets. Each company and publisher is aware of what must yet be done to reach the quota set for the company and himself. Therefore every publisher should strive hard to get at least one more subscription and to place many more bound books and particularly </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font3"> booklets. Concentrate on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOUSE-TO-HOUSE FIELD SERVICE, MAKINO AS MANY BACK-CALLS AS YOU CAN. </span><span class="font3">Company servants should organize evening witnessing groups with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ReJugees</span><span class="font3"> booklets, and, after July 13, with the new booklet. Arrange to quickly cover all the territory that has not yet been gone over with this special offer. By all means leave a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees</span><span class="font3"> booklet or one of the new ones in every home where they will read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The enemy is doing everything it can to break up the witness work. But, by the Lord’s grace, the work is going forward, and with added zeal and power! This is the time to set aside everything that can be humanly ignored and to turn one's full attention and devotion to serving Jehovah and the people of good will —and to arrange to personally attend the convention at Columbus or nearest convention city.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Watchtower Organ Records</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has arranged for the recording of some fine organ musie which can be used by the brethren at model studies, public meetings, zone assemblies, on sound-cars, and on other appropriate occasions, and is pleased to announce that these are now available. They are the regular 12-inch double-faced discs, and may be ordered by number as follows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">WO-1 The Palms (Faure)—To a Wild Itose (MacDowell)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">WO-2 Traumerei and Ilomanza (Schumann)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">WO-3 Second Mazurka (Godard)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">WO-4 Caprice Viennois (Kreisler)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These two discs are available at the regular rates, 70c per disc; six to one address, $3.50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the special work commencing July 13, when the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Judge Rutherford Uncovers fifth Column </span><span class="font3">is distributed, everyone who attends any of our meetings and who has a real desire to see the vindication of Jehovah’s name will want to have a part in its distribution and have a share in exposing the wicked agent of the Devil. Make every arrangement for this campaign immediately. Every company should anticipate many more publishers in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We feel that the Lord has directed the details of the preparation of the Calendar, knowing that this condition would exist in midsummer, and everyone vho professes to be on the side of the Kingdom must take his stand now in the active service of the King. &quot;Thy people will freely offer themselves in the day of thine army.” Now is the time for the Lord's army to move forward as one bod.v praising Ins name. We expect July to see an all-time high for publishers in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is very gratifying to see the wonderful response to the invitations sent out by the Society for Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers to engage in fulltime service of The Theocracy as the number of pioneers steadily increases. As this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> is being prepared, over 800 have been enrolled. This brings the total number of pioneers in the United States to more than 2,600.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The pioneer letter sent out to the companies in June calls attention to the fact that this is the time to &quot;bring all the tithes into the storehouse&quot;, that is. to be a full-time publisher. That letter may be considered in connection with this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society would be negligent of its commission from our Lord and Master if it did not call attention to the righteous requirements of The Theocracy, and so these reminders are brought to the attention of the brethren. As indicated elsewhere in</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Theocratic Convention</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">In view of the petition circulated many of the brethren are wondering regarding the convention. The Society is pushing on with this convention believing it is the Lord’s will to have it. Where it is going to emanate from we cannot say definitely at the present time. However, we will mail to all companies early in July a letter giving them all the details regarding the final setup for the country-wide convention. Pioneers and other brethren en route should inquire of the various companies with which they come in touch for the latest news regarding final arrangements for the convention and the correct address of the point of origin. All have the great privilege of bearing this matter before the Lord in prayer,</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>“Remedy” Record</span></h5>
<h6><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>20,000 Shipped</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">The “Remedy” records, advertising the Columbus convention, have all been shipped. 20,000 of these were made, but this was not sufficient for all the requests. However, it seems to be sufficient to advertise the convention in all parts of the country, and foi' the present no more will be made. Those who did not receive their order at all or received it only in part will receive credit on their accounts. Let those who have them use them diligently in the field prior to the convention. After the convention this record will be an excellent introduction to “Religion as a World Remedy”, which we hope will, by the Lord’s grace, be recorded by that time. When playing “Remedy”, inform the people of the opposition to the convention by the Hierarchy and thus arouse their interest and create a desire on the part of the people to listen to the series &quot;Religion as a World Remedy”, which will be recorded simultaneously as it is sent out to the various convention points. I'lease do not order this series of records, however, until you are Instructed to do so.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Photographs</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">In view of the mob action now in operation throughout the country it seems advisable, where such conditions exist, to have some brethren equipped with good cameras, so that they can take photographs and get actual scenes of these disturbances when they are actually in operation. The brethren should be sure that the mob does not get their cameras and destroy their films. this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> however, the service of a Christian must be voluntary and the Lord Jehovah is not pleading with His people to be faithful or to be active in Uis service. Nor is there coercion that any of Jehovah’s witnesses spend their entire time in the service. Such (pioneer) service is wholly voluntary — a willing, “reasonable service”; no other kind would be pleasing or acceptable to The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let each one, then, carefully examine his affairs, make up his own mind about the matter, and then act in harmony with Jehovah’s purposes. By the time the Theocratic Convention opens, there should be at least </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ONE THOUSAND NEW PIONEERS IN THE HELD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We firmly believe that by the end of July there will be 3,100 reporting regularly in the pioneer service. Will you be one of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This issue of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> will not be mailed in bulk as here with a copy for every publisher, are mailing to each company four or five copies. These are for the company servant, secretary, stockkeeper and back-call servant, and, of course, are to be available to the other servants of the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> should be read at service meetings, and all points thoroughly discussed and plans worked out for carrying out in detail the recommendations therein. For the present the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> will be mailed first-class to each company servant. This will insure better service and less likelihood of the enemy’s finding out our organization arrangements. Company servants will, therefore, have to plan their service meetings with great care, give the brethren all the information, and go with them into action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the beginning of the year Brother Rutherford, in his letter of January 20, called our attention to the following fact: “The year 1940 is certain to be the most important year yet, because Armageddon is very near.” The facts transpiring today throughout the world, even in the United States, prove this statement without any question of doubt. In the latter part of the same letter he states, “The privilege of advertising THE THEOCRACY will soon be completed. Be sure that you do your part.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">MOBS</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Armageddon” Very Widely Advertised for Sunday</span></h5>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Are You Coming?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord’s people throughout the eastern part of the United States are eagerly looking forward to the Newark convention. The opening day, Friday, October 16, is rapidly approaching, and soon a great throng of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, the Jonadabs, will be on their way to take part in what we hope will be the most effective witness ever given in New Jersey. Letters coming in to the office indicate that the brethren are overjoyed with the prospects. It will be a season of rich blessing from the hands of the Lord, and they are making every effort to get to the convention. Much enthusiasm is being manifest, and everyone who truly loves the Lord will be glad to have this opportunity to engage in battle with the enemy, that the “refuge of lies” of the Hierarchy may be further exposed and the name of Jehovah magnified. It seems quite evident that more than 5,000 persons will be In attendance, and everyone within any reasonable distance of Newark will make an earnest effort to get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are pleased to announce that Brother Rutherford will address the convention Saturday afternoon at three o’clock, and again on Sunday, when he will deliver the public lecture on “ARMAGEDDON, THE GREATEST BATTLE OF ALL TIME”. All attending the convention will want to have some share in advertising this lecture. Every effort that can be made in advance to publicize it has been arranged for. It is hoped, by the Lord’s grace, that the crowd turning out to hear the public lecture will be so great that there will not be sufficient room in the Armory to hold the multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the three days there is a territory to be covered that has a population of more than two million people. That means a lot of work, and it will take real determination and complete devotion to the Lord to cover this territory thoroughly. Are you going to be one of the publishers in this glorious campaign? It promises to be a most happy occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I5e sure to have your name on a registration slip. The car driver will turn </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">it in to</span><span class="font1"> the field service department as soon as he arrives. Get your territory and have a share in proclaiming the Kingdom message in a section of the country dominated by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Those with sound cars, when applying for territory, should mention that they have a sound car, and these. Remember your banners advertising the public meeting. Have these mounted and in order before coming to the convention. If you are one of the newly interested and want to symbolize your consecration, be sure to bring your own swimming suit and towel. Come prepared to enjoy all the blessings that the Lord lias in store for you.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>European Conventions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">By Jehovah’s grace, Brother Rutherford has safely returned from overseas, after a survey of European conditions and a season of Intense activity in behalf of the Kingdom interests there. Every Kingdom publisher will want to read the forthcoming issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, </span><span class="font1">containing extensive reports of the European conventions and of the great popular demonstrations at the public addresses by Brother Rutherford, which serve as an index of what you may expect at Newark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Referring you to the fuller reports to appear in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font1"> we here set out some of the noteworthyitems. You’ll see the Lord’s blessing. No matter in what country the witness is being given; no matter what language is used, the same spirit of earnest zeal is seen. Brother Rutherford was greatly used by Jehovah to give what is probably the most effective public witness and warning yet given in the European countries visited. Great opposition was manifested by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Within the last decade, the city of Glasgow has increased its “Catholic population” until now there are as many Catholics as Protestants. Brother Rutherford delivered the message of warning in that city on August 2, 1936. So great was the interest that it required three auditoriums to hold the people that came. “Armageddon” was the subject used, and the message was received with greater enthusiasm than at any other time in Scotland. Over </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">7,000 people </span><span class="font1">crowded into the auditoriums, and many were unable to gain admission. Of course, the Hierarchy was busy warning its “population” not to attend the meetings, but this only served to make a large number of honest Catholics come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah’s witnesses attending the convention in Glasgow threw themselves into advertising </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the big</span><span class="font1"> public witness. Over 1,000 participated in the “sandwich sign” parades, 35 up to 100 in a group, walking up and down the busy streets of Glasgow announcing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font1"> public meeting in this very effective way. Over one hundred autos covered the city and outlying districts with banners and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On Sunday, September 13, 1936, London, England, was warned of the near approach of Armageddon. About 3,000 joined in publicizing the big witness. Over a thousand joined in the “sandwich sign” parades. Crowds came to the Alexandra Palace; some got in, many heard on the outside. Powerful loud-speakers served from the roof of the building. The speaker’s voice was thus carried a great distance from the Palace into the densely populated area. It would be impossible to estimate how many people heard in this way. Never has Great Britain had such a witness in two of its largest cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On September 4, 1936, there gathered in the beautiful and historic city of Lucerne, Switzerland, a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. On Monday, September 7, there was to be a large public witness. Over 3,500 publishers of the Kingdom message attended, from twenty-one different countries. One motive, one thought, dominated all: the honoring of the name of Jehovah. Some had traveled far on foot; others had come a jour-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 3)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Use “Riches” Throughout October </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Battle Shout” Publishers, Keep in Field</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Regularity Is the Thing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">The “Battle Shout”, that great international testimony period of October 3-11, enables the new fiscal year to get off to a flying start, and sets the pace for the Lord’s people for their continued vigorous work with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font1"> During the remainder of October, let </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> be stressed. That publication is filled with information which the people must have now, and which is essential for the great multitude that the members thereof may manifest themselves. So our work for all of October is, primarily, with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the international testimony periods many awaken to their privileges of service and take an active part in carrying to others the message of Jehovah’s kingdom wherewith their own hearts have been made glad. These brethren make it a point to put forth an extra effort on such occasions, so that they may Join with the Lord's people throughout the world in the concerted attack on Satan's organization of falsehoods. It is very good that such an occasion as offered by the testimony periods be taken advantage </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Of,</span><span class="font1"> and this benefits the publishers greatly. These publishers should now continue in the field regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This matter of being regular King-</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Reporting Time in the Field</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>New Method Now Effective</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font1"> other books, booklets, sound cars, phonographs, transcription machines, all of these are included in the war equipment in the hands of the remnant and their associates, for field service. All of these are used in the field, carrying the message of the Kingdom to the people at their homes, and the time of the publishers thus engaged is all reported as hours of field witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If you have not yet carefully studied the special </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> issued in August, “Jehovah’s Service Organization,” you should do so at once; and if you have not carefully studied the subheading “Monthly Reports”, especially paragraph “(4)” thereof, and therefore do not have clearly in mind this new method of reporting time, by all means get out your </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> now and give the matter the careful consideration it must necessarily have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Number of hours in actual field witnessing, bringing the message to the people at their homes with literature and with sound equipment, this is the time to be reported, and includes time spent in phonograph and transcription machine back calls in the people’s homes when delivering orders, as well as in carrying the publications from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">dom publishers should have the attention and consideration of all the brethren. By each one planning his time, setting aside certain days each week for the most important work under the sun, the Kingdom service, he can doubtless arrange to witness regularly, and not merely once in a while. Thus the greatest good can be accomplished, good in advancing the witness, good to those to whom the message is carried, and good to those who are privileged to thus have a larger share in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Time in the field means publishers in the field; and this results in an increased witness. Jehovah has given his people much work to do that they, in performance thereof, may prove their loving devotion to Him. It is necessary that all who love the Lord do what they can to carry the Kingdom message to others in obedience to his commandments. Therefore, for many of the brethren, may the special testimony period of October be the beginning of regular, systematic, weekly field service, that all may share in the war which is now on, the publishers increase, and the hours of witnessing manifest the zeal of those on the side of the Most High coupled with the effective use of such time as is available to each one.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Everybody a Publisher</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Autumn Is a busy time for those in Jehovah’s service. The fall season is in many respects the most favorable time of the year for the service, and this November promises to be no exception. Every one of Jehovah’s people is to have a personal part in the field service. November gives us an opportunity to finish the fall campaign by stressing booklets, inasmuch as along with the continued placing of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font1"> and any other books when opportunity is had, booklets are to be stressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this work with booklets during all of the month of November, the chief placement will, of course, be the ten-cent combination: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing, </span><span class="font1">another colored-cover booklet, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Loyalty</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of ten cents. The publishers, however, should not confine the booklets they carry with them to just three, but should have a good assortment of booklets with them (there are more than thirty different ones), as well as .Riches, so as to be able to take advantage of the many opportunities for placing more. Also, as you have found in your service, often those people whom you</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Sent Yours for September?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By this time every company servant, auxiliary and pioneer should have already sent to this office the report for September, but this is just a reminder for any who may have forgotten to make the report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We earnestly hope that during this new year all will report promptly as they should, sending the reports in immediately at the end of each month. It is not a hard matter to do this, but each month in the past many reports have been late or missing altogether. Your co-operation in this will certainly be greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Sent</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Your Inventory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Inventories are due from every company, auxiliary, and pioneer, showing the stock on hand September 30, 1936, as announced in the September </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font1"> If you have not sent your inventory in to this office on the inventory form enclosed ■with the September </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> it will be appreciated if you will do this at once. In this case it will be well for you to read again the suggestions for making out this inventory, contained in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> mentioned. Regardless of the balance on your account at this office, the inventory is necessary, even if you have paid for all the stock you have on hand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">It is entirely in order, and is advisable when it can be done, for larger combinations of booklets to be placed, such as six, on a contribution of twenty-five cents, or thirteen, on a contribution of fifty cents. The point to have in mind is that November is a booklet month. The more booklets placed, the greater the witness ; so, in addition to the placements of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font1"> carry booklets, a good assortment of them, talk booklets, present booklets, place booklets. The brethren have on hand testimony cards presenting three-booklet combinations, which they may use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Order the booklets and other literature you will need for November’s work now, including </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, </span><span class="font1">remembering that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> will be pushed again during December. You will wish to have a good stock of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> in the foreign languages necessary for your particular territory, and these may be included in your orders. As advantage has been taken of previous booklet campaigns to dispose of old stocks of booklets, the stocks of the companies and others will need to be well replenished for the November and December work; so check up and order.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Do not forget the importance of calling the attention of the people to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Gold&amp;n Age.</span><span class="font1"> All who manifest interest in the Kingdom message should be subscribers for these magazines. These should be particularly stressed in the back-call work. Each publisher making a baek call should have a copy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font1"> to demonstrate to the people.

Brother Rutherford was served with a notice from the city president that arrest would follow any attempt to hold the meeting.

As the message was carried to the outside through loud-speakers placed in the lobby of the auditorium, the crowds there cheered and shouted. Needless to say, it was clearly pointed out who was behind this attempted stopping of the witness; and from the comments heard throughout the entire audience it was seen that an even greater witness had been effected. Satan always overreaches himself. Jehovah always prevails. Some few disgruntled ones demanded that the police officer in charge have the loud-speakers shut off that were serving the people on the outside. The officer said: “I have no authority to do any such thing. I am only here to carry out the orders I have. That speaker can stay on just as long as it likes; I’m not going to touch it”; and he said this with a smile. Copies of the Resolution were handed out to the police who were forming a cordon around the building, and many read it with much interest.</span></p>

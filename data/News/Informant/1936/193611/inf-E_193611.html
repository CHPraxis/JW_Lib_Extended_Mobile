<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Jehovah Richly Blessed His Organization</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">From every state in the Union cars rolled into the city of Newark. The brethren were tired on arrival, but everyone overjoyed with the expectation of serving Jehovah in the enemy’s own back yard. The very first thing the publishers did was to register for service. They obtained their territory and prepared for the fight; and it was a fight. All the police departments of every city were duly informed of the convention by letter and were told what the conventioners were going to do. The letter also invited the officials to the public meeting. The higher-ups gave the police their instructions at once and saw to it that some of Jehovah’s publishers were put behind the bars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Details of the convention, the arrests and persecution will all be set out in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age No. 448.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During Friday, Saturday and Sunday the publishers pressed on in the battle distributing the special </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> which contained Brother Rutherford’s letter to the president of the United States as set out under the heading “Will Roosevelt Support the Hierarchy?” as well as the articles “Haters of God in Germany, Quebec and New Jersey”. This </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> didn’t set well with the authorities, because it dragged them out into the open; nor did the combination of the booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing, Universal</span><span class="font2"> IFur </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Near</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Loyally. </span><span class="font2">The people of New Jersey were being given the opportunity of learning the truth, and it is the truth that hurts the Devil’s wicked crowd. Each day found an increase in the number of publishers, beginning with 1,000 on Friday, 2,000 on Saturday, and reaching a peak of 4,247 publishers on Sunday. In spite of downpour of rain on Saturday, at times torrential, the brethren moved forward as one army into the outdoor field service. It seems as though the Devil put every obstacle in the way of Jehovah’s witnesses, but this did not deter them. They were there to serve the Lord, and they were neither surprised nor dismayed at obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">12,000 Hear Brother Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The public meeting Sunday was the big feature of the convention, and all the publishers did everything possible to advertise this public meeting. “Sandwich sign” parades were arranged which thoroughly startled the inhabitants of Newark. They could not figure it out; here were well-dressed people, sober-minded persons, not radicals nor strikers, walking through the streets unashamed with “sandwich signs” on. That’s something that isn’t often done. All the automobiles and cars, which numbered approximately 2,000, had large eight-foot signs on them, or placards, and this in itself was a real witness and directed the attention of the people to Armageddon, the greatest battle of all time. The people came. They heard a most thrilling lecture which took Brother Rutherford nearly two hours to deliver. The audience paid rapt attention; applause broke out again and again. The orderliness, the quietness, the intense interest shown by all present, were an eye-opener to the police and the authorities in the Armory. To hear Brother Rutherford deliver that lecture on Armageddon was a joy to everyone’s heart. The argument presented was so convincing that at the close, when the “Declabation and Wabning” was read to the people, 12,000 who packed out the auditorium stood up as one man. There was no hesitation on the part of anyone. As the people left the auditorium a printed copy of the “Declaration and Warning” was presented to every person, and, additionally, there were 9,671 books and booklets distributed at the public meeting. A wonderful witness was given to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name. WBBR, the Society’s own station, carried the lecture, which covers splendidly all of the New Jersey area, and was heard even as far north as Troy, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah brought to His people rich blessings Saturday afternoon, when Brother Rutherford spoke on the prophetic drama of Joseph and his brethren. This was a great comfort and aid, meat in due season, to everyone. There were well over 6,000 conventioners in attendance at this meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneers Rejoice</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pioneers came from every nook and corner. Those registering showed that they came from their territory in forty different states and there were quite a few there from the various parts of Canada. The pioneers were thrilled beyond words at the privilege of being there, and appreciated the arrangement the Society made for taking care of their expenses to and from the convention as well as providing them with a free meal ticket. With it they could get anything that was offered at the cafeteria. It was interesting to note that all these pioneers were on hand Friday morning ready for the service. They all registered, got needed literature, and went out in the field</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Newark convention is over, but the witness there commenced will continue. Of those in attendance 114 were arrested for the offense of worshiping Almighty God in New Jersey. The following cities joined in the conspiracy to jail Jehovah’s witnesses:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">Caldwell Harrison Hoboken Jersey City Lyndhurst Middlesex Montclair</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">North Arlington Orange Prospect Park Ridgefield Park Union City Weehawken</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At Hoboken 35 have been sentenced to prison for thirty days each, and one for sixty days. At Jersey City 17 have been sentenced for ten days each. At Weehawken 5 have received thirty-day sentences. Trials are still pending in 34 cases. Others have been released without trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The trials of these brethren were a disgrace to any community that claims to be civilized. Judges acted in a dual capacity of court and prosecutor. Convictions were entered without evidence. A thirty-day sentence was given in one case for declining to testify. Many were sentenced just for being in the city with Bible literature in their possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Back of this cruel and outrageous maladministration of justice is the conspiracy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to suppress truth, rightuntil the first meeting Friday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There were many other brethren who came Friday also and prepared for the field service. By Friday afternoon there were approximately 4,000 in attendance at the convention. Every provision was made to assist the brethren in obtaining rooms and directing them to their territory. Their territories were laid out plainly, so that they could understand. Free parking was provided. A trailer camp with ample facilities was arranged for the pioneers and others who came in housecars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A splendid cafeteria operated by the Society served wholesome food. It was observed that very few of the brethren attending the convention went outside for meals, because of the splendid provision made at the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The electric signs were used to point out where the various departments were located. It gave the brethren a good idea of how these signs can be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Field Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A most remarkable witness was given in New Jersey. Jehovah richly blessed his organization in carrying his message to the people. During eousness and freedom of worship. A prominent “child” of the Catholic church is Mayor Frank Hague, of Jersey City. Hague is the political boss of New Jersey, and his power is such that a word from him is law in most of the state. There is good reason to believe that Mayor Hague is co-operating with the Hierarchy in this Inquisition. These persecutors pose before the world as clean men. Fittingly applied to them are the words of Jesus at Matthew 23: 27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">NOW is the time for every one of Jehovah’s witnesses, every Jona-dab, and every person who believes in freedom of worship to protest forcibly and vigorously against such shameful and infamous proceedings. Will you write a letter at once to each of the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mayor Frank Hague, Jersey City, N. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Governor Harold G. Hoffman, Trenton, N. Jt</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In your letters call attention to this abominable treatment of Christian people, and strongly condemn such acts of religious persecution. Make demand that the governor institute a thorough investigation of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the three days’ convention nearly 100,000 pieces of literature were placed, in 43,890 homes. Not only was there a considerable amount of literature placed, which the people can study, but 137,301 people heard the message by means of the sound equipment. Many truly interested were found in the territory, and 522 requested that a back call be made or turned their names in at the public meeting so as to have someone call with the phonograph.

<p><span class="font2">The October </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> carried the following statement: “What a fitting climax to the year 1936, ‘His Victory’ testimony period, December 5-13!” Since that article was written events have been happening thick and fast: the Newark convention, the opposition of the Hierarchy, the arrests and imprisonment of a large number of our brethren, their thrilling testimony before the rulers by both word and act, clearly testifying that they were for the Lord first, last and all the time, and their willingness to seal this testimony with their lives, if necessary; and upon all this, Brother Rutherford’s challenge to the Devil, the Hierarchy and their New Jersey representatives in his public address, “Armageddon, the Greatest Battle of All Time”—all leading up to the grand climax of 1936, “His Victory” testimony period!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Other notices in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">regarding the “correspondence campaign” to be carried on will keep this issue definitely before the enemy and before our brethren who are privileged to participate in the various features of it up until December 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A large majority of the brethren throughout the country were unable to have a very direct part in these preliminary skirmishes; however, we shall all have an opportunity to have a part in “His Victory” testimony period. Will each and every one take advantage of this opportunity with the same zeal and enthusiasm manifested by the brethren at the Newark convention? We are confident that they will. The brethren throughout the country were with the eonventioners in spirit and were kept away only because of conditions beyond their control. Now </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column </span><span class="font2">the affair and hold open hearings thereon, in order that those guilty of the unholy conspiracy may be brought to justice; state that such actions are destructive of American liberties and a disgrace to the state of New Jersey, and that all officials supporting or condoning such proceedings are responsible before Almighty God therefor. Tell Mayor Hague that if he has any regard for public decency and the rights of Christian people he will use his influence to bring such unholy persecution to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren incarcerated are from many states. If one or more are from your area, write to your local congressmen and senators and protest to them over the treatment given a citizen of their state. Advise them to investigate and demand a Congressional investigation of these inhuman and pernicious tactics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Write these letters in your own words. Make them short, concise and strong. Demand action. ‘Rise and shout against her’ with all your might. Write on only one side of the paper. Use a typewriter if possible. Keep a copy of your letter. Don’t wait. Do it now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is an opportunity to assist your brethren who are behind prison bars, and to assist in giving further testimony against the enemy and for Jehovah. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">DO IT NOW.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Edward M. Boehmer, 16 Abbey Ave., Dayton, Ohio those who were unable to attend the Newark convention are privileged to unite in this final campaign of the year 1936. Let one and all determine, by the Lord’s grace, to make definite time quotas during this period if possible. Pioneers, at least 40 hours; auxiliaries, a minimum of 20 hours; company publishers, a minimum of 10 hours; and all, of course, as much more as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our equipment for the campaign is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, Choosing, Universal War Near</span><span class="font2"> and a self-covered booklet, on a contribution of thirty-five cents. The Hierarchy issue was brought to the fore at the Newark convention in Brother Rutherford’s speech and literature distributed. Let the brethren throughout the land continue to “push the battle to the gate” with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> book and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing </span><span class="font2">booklet particularly. These rip right through the Hierarchy’s refuge of lies and expose her for what she is to all people of good will, and the Lord’s people, both anointed and Jonadabs, will rejoice in making “His Victory” testimony period one of tireless activity against the visible representatives of Satan on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Plan your territory, urban territory, of course, as this will be practically a winter campaign. Arrange now to plan your time, your means of transportation, and other details that can be taken care of in advance. Sound cars and publishers should be assigned to territory for each day of the period. Let the company servant, the service committee and publishers all get busy now and do their part in making the necessary preliminary arrangements for this the banner witness period of all time, a campaign that will be worthy of the title: “His Victory.”</span></p>

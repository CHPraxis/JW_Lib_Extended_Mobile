<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Let It Resound August 1 to 9 The Next Testimony Period</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Check over your stock o£ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> 1, 2 and 3, and see that you have a good supply on hand, ordering all you will need. Use from your storage stock, getting this ammunition in the hands of the publishers ahead of time, because these three volumes are the special campaign pieces for ‘'Jehovah’s Praise” testimony period, August 1 to 9 inclusive. These three will be presented, on a contribution of 50e, and any of the brethren may use </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font1"> 1 and 2 and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font1"> along with the three </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> books, on a contribution of a dollar, or place these others with those who already have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication.</span><span class="font1"> What an offer to the people I Special three-book wrappers will be sent with the next </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font1">as well as testimony cards presenting this special offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the 50c combination cannot be taken, drop to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of 25c; and if a smaller combination is desired, present three booklets, two colored-cover and one self-covered, on contribution of 10c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is the midsummer campaign, and is vacation time. Those brethren who are engaged in secular work, why not try to join the Bethel family in having your vacation to embrace “Jehovah’s Praise” testimony period, and make this your big period of the year so far for hours in the service? Good news in respect to this special offer of literature: It does not end with the 9th, but is to be continued throughout the entire month of August, only!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The company territory should be covered with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> by the end of July. Those who have received </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> should be specially called on during August, as they should certainly be anxious to have further Kingdom instruction. Aid everyone in the company and associated therewith to take part in the service at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehu, his work; Jonadab, his antitype ; the man with the inkhorn, his commission, and what he foreshadowed : this is all of great importance to those who take their stand on Jehovah’s side before Armageddon. In detail, these and other related truths are dealt with in the publications offered to the people during this period. Let everyone show his love for the Lord by his efforts in singing Jehovah’s praise with these special provisions, and, additionally, in using the sound equipment during the August campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fight is on ; the battle between truth and entrenched lies. Make your share in the battle as effective as possible by getting in time in the field. All-day witnessing, lunch in the territory, weekday service: these will help build up your hours and results to Jehovah’s praise. The ambassador of Jehovah speaks to His people saying, “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle” !</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Prepare now, laying out your territory, checking over your stock of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> books. Arrange your vacation or what time you can so as to make this a week to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark7"></a>&quot;NAME</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">With God’s children there should be nothing in a name to furnish an excuse for the exaltation of men. Some persons appear to gladly seize upon the meaning that may be placed upon a name as an excuse for self-exaltation or for unnecessary criticism of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name “Director'', by which this paper has been known for some time, means in the English merely one who transmits information concerning the directing or instructions relative to field service work. In some languages, however, the word when translated appears to have a different meaning. Eor instance, the name “Director” translated in one language is given the meaning of “Commander, Big boss, or Important one”. All such names are displeasing to the Lord and should be avoided. Eor reasons assigned, this paper hereafter will be designated as informant. That name means merely one who or that which gives information. The purpose of this paper is to give information to the field workers about the work and the manner in which it is to be done, so that all may work harmoniously. When you receive your copy you may expect to find therein up-to-date information given out by the Society organization for the benefit of those who do the publishing work concerning the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a man desires to be approved of men, the Devil seizes upon that selfish desire to induce such a one to exalt himself and thus cause friction in the Lord’s organization. It seems best, therefore, that the following changes should be made in the names or titles of positions held in the organization, to wit: Instead of using the name or title “company director”, hereafter that position will be known as “company servant”; instead of using the name “regional service director”, hereafter that position will be known as “regional servant”; instead of “divisional leader”, hereafter that position will be known as “divisional servant”. Remember the words of the Lord Jesus: ‘For one is your Master, even Christ, and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased.’ (Matt. 23:9-12) All the true followers of Christ Jesus are servants. There is no excuse or justification to exalt one above another. To whatsoever position one in the Lord's organization is assigned, he should serve obediently and joyfully and without murmuring, complaining, or faultfinding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where a number of companies are working together, for instance, such as the area of Greater New York or London, the person who takes the lead and transmits the instructions received, instead of being known as “service director”, will hereafter be known as “servant of companies”, and the servant of the separate companies in this organization will be known as “captain of service”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hereafter none of the servants in the field will be known as “sharpshooters”. That is eliminated, and all such workers are considered as companies or integral parts of companies. If there is just one isolated person in the community, instead of being known as “sharpshooter”, he is merely a servant, meaning, of course, servant of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us see to it that no excuse is furnished for self-exaltation of any creature. We are all brethren in Christ and delight to serve one Master and one God. All at unity in Christ will work exactly in harmony and will be willing and anxious to carry out the information received through the INFORMANT, or other means that proceeds from the proper source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Heretofore the Society’s representative at a branch office has been known as “manager” or “director”. Hereafter such representatives will be known as “branch servants”, meaning the representative of the Society at a branch office, acting with authority from the main office of the Society and, of course, as servant of the Lord. All branch offices, please be governed accordingly.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>New Phonograph</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Weighs Only 9% Pounds</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The use of the phonograph is becoming more pronounced every day. Its use in the field is bringing splendid results and presenting clearly to many of the “great multitude” the truths which sweep away the refuge of lies. Do you have one? and are you using it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Society has just completed a newly designed phonograph, the size of which is 1-1x13x5 inches, covered with brown cloth and having rounded corners. Its weight is 9 pounds 13 ounces, and one can carry three discs. With the three discs it weighs 12 pounds 6 ounces. This machine is made very compact, which could be accomplished only by use of a removable tone arm. It is a very simple matter to attach this in its proper position, and it is ready for use immediately. The volume is just as strong as of the previous model, and its tone is of the best quality. When the machines are sent out from here they are timed properly, at 78 r.p.m. Do not change this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The phonograph is being placed with the company publishers and auxiliaries with three discs on a contribution of $10.00. If you already have records and prefer this phonograph it can be had for .$8.00. Special rates are made for pioneers. Order your phonograph now. Keep them busy in your regular door-to-door witnessing, back calls and loaning to parties who will use them extensively. Have in mind that this new phonograph is 5} pounds lighter than our last one.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Riches</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Studies</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to carefully roading </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font1"> the brethren of all company units will wish to study this publication. There should be available in every unit a study of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The &quot;Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> book which all may attend. It is recommended that those companies that have not already done so institute </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches </span><span class="font1">studies even if this necessitates the changing of some of the other book and booklet studies which are now being held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As soon as possible, therefore, all studies of newly interested, including the studies developed from transcription and phonograph meetings, should use </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> as the textbook. The information contained therein is of great importance and will prove most valuable as a study, not only for those recently coming to a knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes, but to all the Lord's people, the anointed as well as those of the Jonadab class, and a careful study will prove most profitable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers Increased;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Hours Dropped</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The result of “His Strange Work” testimony period has been waited for with anticipation by the brethren everywhere. Herewitli find a comparison between “His Strange Work” testimony period of April this year and the“Anointed’s Thanksgiving” period, of April last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> book went splendidly. It has exceeded any other single bound-book distribution we have ever had by over 35,000. In fact, the increase in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> placements over its closest competitor, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation, </span><span class="font1">was greater than the total placements for special periods a few years back. We placed 140,491 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> during that week, to compare with 104,553 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span><span class="font1"> The figures in this comparison speak for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let each one of the anointed and their companions, however, study them very carefully, compare them with their own personal activity and see how the Lord really blessed them by permitting them to have a part in contributing to this splendid increase, and also let each one examine himself and see to what extent he was responsible for the decrease in time spent in the service.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Each company (which from now on, of course, includes all organizations which were formerly known as “sharpshooters”) will receive from June 11 to 15 a special letter addressed “to all publishers of the Kingdom”, and it has to do with the pioneer and auxiliary service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The company servant is being instructed in each case to read the letter to the largest assembly of publishers at the first opportunity</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">New Radio Folder</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A new radio folder is being prepared advertising the stations throughout the United States now carrying the regular five-minute series by Brother Rutherford. It has been changed considerably, and one point of importance that should be noted by the brethren is the announcement that a special service is carried on by Jehovah's witnesses, namely, the use of the phonograph, by which these lectures can be brought to their home at the time convenient to the person desiring these lectures. This notice closes with the statement, “Address Watch Tower, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N. Y., or Phone.” The brethren can stamp on these radio folders their phone numl&gt;er and local address before' distributing them in their territory. It might be well to choose the phone number of some individual where there is usually someone at home. 1’ioneers in isolated territory, if at some rooming bouse, might obtain permission from the landlord to stamp his phone number, and explain to this party to get the name and address of anyone you might phone. The truth should be made available to all persons, whether we find them at homo in our regular door-to-door witnessing or not. Radio folders should always be left at homes when no one is there. I’o not, however, leave them in the mail boxes. Slip them under the door or in some other convenient place where they will lie found. ers in the field during “His Strange Work” period, this year, than there were during “The Anointed’s Thanksgiving” period, of April last year, we are 16,521 hours short of last year. In other words, the average number of hours per publisher dropped from 11.3 hours last year to 10.3 hours this year. That drop, on an average of one hour per publisher, meant just 13,500 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches </span><span class="font1">books. In other words, if we had maintained last year’s average, each publisher putting in 31.3 hours, we should have 13,500 more </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> in the hands of the people than were placed. There is much food for serious thought here on the part of each and every one of us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Transcription records of “Separating the Nations” translated into Spanish have recently been consigned to the companies and pioneers using sound equipment and located in Spanish territory. The Society has now on hand some other Spanish transcription records (334-r.p.m.) formerly used over the radio. This supply is made up of the following lectures: “Commerce,” “Way of Escape,” &quot;Effect of Holy Year,” “Kingdom Blessings,” “His Organization,” “World Recovery,” “World Control,” and “Flee Now”. Upon request a supply of these records will be sent without charge to any company or pioneer able to use them effectively among the Spanish-speaking people. When making your request, specify which lectures you would like to have. This also applies to the brethren serving under the Brooklyn office but living in Cuba. Costa Rica, Panama, Canal Zone, and Colombia.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Servants to Order More if Needed</span></p>

Everyone in the service should receive the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> regularly, and read it. that he may be well informed as to the witness campaign and can take part therein. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> should be studied at the service meetings. The chairman of the various study meetings of newly interested can supply those attending who do not get it at the service meeting, so that all who desire to do so may receive it. If your company is not receiving a sufficient number of copies of each issue to supply all, the company servant should advise us at once of the quantity needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Cars and PTM Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A wonderful work is being carried on in the field by means of the sound cars and the portable transcription machines. Many of the brethren who have only the portable transcription machines have the wrong idea that this can be used only indoors. If you do not sight, but are anxious to see the provision God has made for their eternal welfare. The pioneers and other publishers should take occasion to find out the interested ones who have lost their natural sight, and do what they can to help them. We suggest they write to the Society’s department for the Blind at 1210 Spear St.. Logansport, Indiana. You cannot fully appreciate the real pleasure the blind people have in reading the truth in the Braille language.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Vacation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Place Your Orders Now</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">No Mail Will Be Answered</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The factory and office at Brooklyn will be closed from July 25 to August 9 inclusive. During this period of two weeks, members of the Bethel family can enjoy the privilege of witnessing in the field with other Kingdom publishers. No orders will be filled and no shipments made of literature during this time. If you need a supply of books or booklets, order sufficient for the two weeks of vacation and at least the four weeks following. Every company servant and pioneer and auxiliary publisher should check your stock immediately and within the next two weeks place your order. Do not run short of literature. Have plenty of ammunition to carry on during the “Jehovah’s IT.aise” testimony period, which is August 1-9. Please bear in mind that orders cannot be filled during vacation period, as no one will be here to answer letters or telegrams. The mail will be given immediate attention on the reopening of the factory on August 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Any new territory required should be written for now. Please do not wait until the last minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“There Is No Want to Them That Fear Jehovah”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That is the statement on the July Calendar pad. You can appreciate this assuring expression because we understand that the fear of the Lord is to hate evil, pride and arrogancy. Those who are in Jehovah’s organization surely hate the Devil and all of his wicked arrangements, and because of their devotion to Jehovah they have no want. The Lord has furnished the people with a bountiful message contained in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font1"> and during the remainder of June and all of July the special combination will be made of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> and three booklets, on a contribution of 35c. By June 15 more than 1,200,000 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> books will have been shipped out at the Brooklyn factory alone. The demand Is as great now as it was two months ago. if not more so. June and July should be big months for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font1"> Do not forgot to keep a good supply on hand, particularly for the vacation period. Maybe you would better check your stock, and order, along with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, Lir/ht </span><span class="font1">1 and 2 and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font1"> for the August campaign, unless you have a good storage of these books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">have a sound car, and even if you do, put your transcription machine in another car, set the horn on the roof and operate these transcription machines throughout your territory just as you would a sound car. The transcription machine which you have has sufficient power to be heard for one or two blocks, and the machine can be used right along with the publishers in the territory. Put your equipment to use. Time in the service with these sound machines, sound cars and phonographs is as essential as your door-to-door witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For those of you who have ordered sound car equipment No. 3 the Society is manufacturing them as fast as possible. We are hack on our orders and we are trying to fill them in the order in which they were received. At the present, orders are being received faster than we are making them; but do not let this deter you from sending in your orders, as everything possible is being done to dispatch them. Summer is here. Keep the sound cars and PTM machines busy in Kingdom work.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Will You Be One of Them?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">For many years past the publications of the Society have pointed out how Jehovah’s witnesses have faithfully carried on in New Jersey in face of much opposition and persecution on the pari of the Hierarchy. The common people, we dare say, are anxious to learn the truth concerning Jehovah’s purposes but in many places have been hindered in learning this truth because of sinister influence. It is Indeed a joy to those who have taken their stand on the side of the Kingdom to come in convention assembled to hear the refreshing truths by which Jehovah assures His people that they are </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font4">the right side and that their course of action is the proper one. Such a convention will be held at the Armory, Sussex Ave., Newark, N. J., on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, October 16, 17 and 18, 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regardless of threats, coercion and vicious opposition, the faithful have pressed on proclaiming the message of the Kingdom. Will you join them in that state during this convention? The witness work in New Jersey will afford everyone an opportunity to be a publisher, and it may be your privilege to come up against some of this opposition.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Information</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The Information booth will be found near the main entrance of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">Armory. This booth is for general information as to location of various departments and where found articles may be turned in and inquiry made for lost articles. If you desire any information concern</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font4">your territory and its location, inquire at the Service Department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BOOK ROOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Book Room will be at the extreme end of the auditorium, opposite the main entrance. The books will be supplied at company and pioneer rates. The pioneers, however, will have to show their identification cards. Announcement will be made later as to what literature will be used. Combinations will be made up in small packages, so that it will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">not be </span><span class="font4">necessary for anyone to return books for credit at the close </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BULLETIN BOARD</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This board will be located just inside the main entrance, on the left, and is for telegrams and important notices only. No announcements will be made from the plat</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoiccr</span><span class="font4"> magazine and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Aye</span><span class="font4"> have submitted the proof without question that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the sin-ister influence behind the movement to crush and destroy the activities of Jehovah's Kingdom. The brethren who have been active in New Jersey have been privileged to go through several years of hard work, and it will be a privilege now for their brethren to join them in this territory to the praise of Jehovah’s name. The area to be covered during the three-day convention takes in a population of more than two million people right where the Roman Catholic Inquisition of America operates at its best, and it will require a goodly number of publishers to thoroughly cover this territory with the Kingdom message and advertise the public lecture by Brother Rutherford on </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Armageddon”.</span><span class="font4"> Jehovah’s witnesses and Jonadabs who can possibly arrange to be at the convention will be there. There is every reason to believe that 5,000 to 8,000 publishers will be in the field, and the instructions set out elsewhere in this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> should be considered carefully so that Jehovah’s organization can move into action. And now, onward “For Jehovah and for Gideon 1” form except announcements relative to the convention itself, and these will be made by the chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CAFETERIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A menu will be provided, showing what foods are available at the Cafeteria. Good wholesome food will be served throughout the convention period. Arrangements are being made so that the pioneers can obtain their meals free. The pioneers must register at the Pioneer booth. The small amount charged other persons for the food will be to cover the cost of their own and that which the pioneers will take. See the program for the time that the Cafeteria is open. Breakfast will be served each morning from 7 to 9, at which time a box lunch will be prepared to take with you in the field. Every person should take this box lunch with him when he gets his breakfast each day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Please keep the auditorium neat and clean, and throw all waste material into cans provided for that purpose. Do not leave dirt on the floors or chairs. Tickets must be purchased in advance, from the cashier, to obtain food at the Cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD SERVICE</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">On the last day of the convention, Sunday, October 18, at 3 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, by the Lord's grace, Brother Rutherford will deliver his now famous lecture, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Armageddon.”</span><span class="font4"> Brother Rutherford has been enjoying many privileges of service given him by the Lord on his trip through Europe. In many of the large cities abroad the public meetings were packed to capacity, the audiences intently interested in </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;Armageddon”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This important lecture will be advertised widely, so that the people of good will throughout New Jersey and New York city will have the opportunity of hearing it delivered by him in person. Armageddon, the greatest battle of all time; that’s something people must learn of today. They ask, What is it? Why must it be fought? When will it be fought? and who is involved? The answer to these questions will undoubtedly be appreciated by the au</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Signs Placards Handbills Sound</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">There is no greater organization in the world today than that formed by Jehovah. He has instructed His people to preach this gospel of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness, and that, by His grace, they will do. Conventions such as this one at Newark require much advertising, and the Lord’s people appreciate this opportunity of putting forth an extraordinary effort, particularly in an area where more than 2,000,000 people will be informed of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Advertise</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All ears coming to the convention at Newark who can arrange it, should prepare large banners which can be mounted on the top of their car, the printing to be painted on sign muslin. Attractive colors should be used, and it should be done neatly. Some might prefer to have tire covers, bumper streamers, anything to attract attention and advertise the lecture. In addition to signs on your</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fight”. Additional points to have in mind: Be sure to work thoroughly the territory that is marked on the map, doing the streets inside the boundaries and the one side of the street marking the boundary. This means you are to witness to all homes, streets, factories, business districts. Phonographs should be used right along in the service work. Names of the interested parties should be taken. If you can make dience. The Armory, having a capacity of 10,000, wo can feel confident will be packed out. Are you coming to the convention at Newark to help advertise this speech and co-operate in advertising the Kingdom interests generally in New Jersey?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you are coming to the convention in a car, be sure a big sign painted in attractive colors is on the car, so that as long as you are in Ilie New Jersey area people will be informed of the speech</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PARKING AND TRAFFIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are two very convenient parking lots which will be free to all of Jehovah’s witnesses. These are marked on the map.

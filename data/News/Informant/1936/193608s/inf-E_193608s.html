<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Service Organization </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">To Be Studied Carefully by Publishers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Wherein Can Your Witness Work Be Improved?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The purpose here is to set out clearly the organization of those who love Jehovah, so that all who have taken their stand on Jehovah’s side may take part therein. All active persons are “publishers”, because they publish or make known to others the truth they have received from Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Company Organization</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">A company consists of two or more publishers who are regularly devoting a combined total of eight or more hours (average) a month in carrying the Watch Toweb publications to the people from house to house in accordance with the campaign outlined in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> but who are not serving as pioneers or auxiliaries. If there is just one isolated publisher, he is merely a servant, meaning, of course, servant of the Lord. To be enrolled, he will spend eight or more hours in field service. Each company is identified by the postoffice town in which it makes its headquarters. It has a company servant appointed by the Society. Also, where there arc two or more publishers, a secretary, with whom the Society may communicate as necessity may require. A service committee Is necessary only in companies averaging eight or more publishers a month regularly in the field and whose time averages more than 100 hours a month for all the publishers exclusive of pioneers or auxiliaries. In companies smaller than this there is no need for a service committee, the company servant attending to all that work, with such assistants as he may ask the company to elect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The responsibility for determining who shall be recommended for company servant, and who shall serve as members of the service committee, rests upon the company as a whole. Anyone, in order to be properly selected, must first show that he has and manifests the spirit of the Lord, that he is kind and considerate, that he deals justly with his brethren, and is personally active in the house-to-house service and will perform the duties given him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COMPANY SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He will receive the Society’s instructions regarding service, and, co-operating with the company and the service committee, is to apply these to the activities of the local organization. He is to keep the company field records, report monthly to the Society, see that tiie company territory is properly assigned to the publishers, that file field witness and sound machine service are carried on, that all interested are supplied with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> ami all publishers with testimony cards and everything necessary for the service. He will mail to the Society remittances and orders for literature and other supplies, and carry on all correspondence relative to the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When a company is not large enough to require a service committee, the company servant will personally be responsible for assigning territory, issuing literature, advancing sound machine activity, reporting field activity to the Society and keeping check on the company’s account and stock, and reporting on these items to the company each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Beyond the above the company servant has no supervision by virtue of his appointment as company servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SECRETARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each company of two or more publishers is to have a secretary on the Society’s records for communication with the company, and also attending to such correspondence as the company may request, other than service matters. Also, this one should keep the minutes of the business transacted by the company and the service committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE COMMITTEE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This committee is composed of not less than three and not more than seven brethren elected by vote of the company. Sisters should not be selected if there are capable brethren available. All those selected for the service committee should be active and competent and manifest the spirit of Jehovah, being devoted to him and willing to obey organization instructions. This committee should be selected once each year, the term of office being October 1 to September 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As soon as possible after the company has been notified of the Society's appointment of company servant the service committee will by vote appoint the members of the committee to the various duties specified herein, as secretary, sound servant, stockkeeper, treasurer, and present these nominations to the company for their approval by vote. The committee may select its chairman. It will also appoint the study chairmen of the various study meetings. but these need not be confined to the members of the committee; but select capable brethren for this service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUND SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He works with and under the general supervision of the company servant in advancing the sound machine activity in the company territory in accordance with the instructions sent to the company servant by the Society for phonographs, sound cars and transcription machines. He will take part in the service meetings from time to time, devising ways and means of following the instructions in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">made out to Watch Toweb Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, by the treasurer, and turned over to the company servant for mailing to the Society. The money due the Society on the company book account is not to be used for anything else at any time. Remittances should be sent to the Society regularly by companies, pioneers and auxiliaries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Credit Arrangement</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">If necessary, a small supply of books may be had on credit, with tin' understanding that they will be paid for as placed with the people. However, no company, pioneer or auxiliary should run into debt, and if it is possible for you to accompany each order with remittance to cover, this is preferable. If not, the cost of the books must be set aside as they are placed and be sent to this office in regular payments. If you strictly adhere to this practice, by the time you are in need of more books your account will be sufficiently reduced to warrant the making of another shipment on credit. If you do not follow this procedure we cannot extend credit to you. A company account is the responsibility of the entire group, and the service committee should look after the interest of the company in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AUDIT OF ACCOUNT</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every three months there should be a careful examination of the treasurer’s books to see that everything is correct, all the money accounted for. It will be the duty of the service committee to appoint each time one to do this work, who will go over the record of all business transacted by the company, contributions, book fund, account and stock, see that the record is correct, and, if not, wherein lies the error, and what steps are necessary to correct the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INVOICES AND STATEMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For every charge on your account an invoice will be sent. These should be checked over at once to see that they agree with-the number of books you have received and that no error has been made in the charge. If any errors are found, notify us at once, referring to the invoice by the number appearing at the top. Do not return the invoice, but keep it for your records. We have a copy here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A statement of your account will be mailed to you regularly, being sent to the company servant and direct to pioneers and auxiliaries. This will show the date and total of each invoice and credit memorandum sent to you during the month. The totals of the invoices will appear in the column headed “Charges”, the credit memos under “Credits”, and in the third column, “Balance,” appears the balance of your account as each entry is made. The last amount in this third column is the balance on your account after all charges and credits put through before the end of the month are entered. If you see stamped on tiie statement, “Balance Due You,” you know that the amount in the third column is not owing the Society, but is to your credit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Check over each statement care-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">and other instructions, enabling all the publishers to participate therein. In large companies this may require one or more assistants. No one is to operate any sound equipment to the exclusion of his personal participation in the door-to-door witnessing with the literature. All transcription records and other supplies will be sent to the company servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">STOCKKEEPER</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All of the company’s stock, including transcription records and supplies, should be under his supervision, and he is to supply the publishers with literature. He is to assist in making up orders to be sent to the Society by the company servant. All money received by the .stockkeeper from publishers at the time literature is placed with them is to be turned over to the treasurer, and proper receipt for same be received from the treasurer. Literature placed with the brethren on credit should be properly Issued on statements made out in triplicate and signed by the party receiving the literature. The original may be given to the party getting the literature, the first carbon copy turned over to the treasurer for collection later, and the other carbon copy should be retained by the stockkeeper. The total cash on hand, money due from the publishers, plus stock on hand should always equal the amount due the Society. A physical inventory should be taken twice a year at least. At any time the stockkeeper may figure what is on hand from the record of literature put into the hands of the publishers since the last inventory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">STUDY CHAIRMEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These are brethren of the company who are active in the service and capable of conducting the various studies of the company. As it is advisable for these to be rotated, they should be scheduled by the service committee so one will conduct a study for not more than three months at a time before being changed to another study. These are to assist the study group in the liouse-to-house witnessing, leading them in the field, furnishing them with each issue of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">(when they do not procure this at the service meetings), and all other supplies necessary. The study chairmen should attend all company service meetings so as to be fully informed of tiie company activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TREASURER</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to the book money, every company will have some expenses which are met by voluntary contributions of the brethren in the company, the contributions being dropped in a box provided in the meeting place. It is against the policy of the Society’ for any “collection plate” to be passed at any time. There is to be but one treasurer in a company, who handles all the company funds. He will collect all money from the brethren who obtain literature on credit, a statement of which will be supplied to him b.v the stockkeeper regularly. All remittances to the Society will be made by check, draft or money order</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">fully with your invoices and credit memos to see that all entries are correct. Compare by date, number and total amount. A remittance or order not received at this office until the end of the month will not appear on the statement for that month, but will be on the statement for the month following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In writing about your account, do not return your statement, but keep it for your records. Al explanation of what is wrong is sufficient, since we have a record here. In writing about orders, refer to them by their date and number on the duplicate which you keep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REMITTANCES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mail all remittances direct to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N.Y. Do not under any circumstances send any remittances to any of the depots. Do not send currency through the mails, because it is liable to be stolen. The check will be drawn, or money order or draft be obtained, by the treasurer and mailed by the company servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Remittances sent in without orders will be acknowledged on credit memorandums. Remittances sent in with orders will be acknowledged at the bottom of the invoice on which the order is charged. Thus every remittance will be acknowledged.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Divisional Campaigns</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">From time to time companies in an area participate in concentrated witnessing in divisional campaigns. The divisional servant is appointed by the Society, and his sole duty is to convey to the publishers the Society’s instructions to him and lead in these campaigns. The divisional servant’s duties end there, and, as such, he has absolutely no jurisdiction in any matters aside from the specific divisional campaigns. Brethren participating in divisional campaigns make a special report at the campaign and also include this activity in their regular monthly report to this office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>General Instructions</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CHANGING ADDRESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Be sure to notify us of all changes in your address. Use a regular letter or post card unless you are a pioneer or an auxiliary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following applies to pioneers and auxiliaries only: These are always to use the “Change of Address” slips furnished by the Society. Mail a slip with the change thereon to this office before you move. Change of address notice on orders or report cards or in letters is not sufficient; a slip must be used. Allow two weeks from mailing notice to make the change if in the far west, or one week if near by. If in the party there are two or more wishing to have their address changed, please always send a slip for each member of the party; and this applies to man and wife, too. “Change of Address” slips are for the use of pioneers and auxiliaries only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CORRESPONDENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All your letters, orders, requests for territory, remittances, reports, etc., in English or foreign languages, should be addressed to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N. Y. Be sure to mark the envelope in accordance with the status of your enrollment, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies: “Company Service.” Pioneers: “Pioneer Service.” Auxiliaries: “Auxiliary Service.” Correspondence or complaints regarding the filling of orders, nonreceipt of orders, goods received in bad condition or shipments that have been lost should not be sent to any of the depots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Be sure to show at the top of the first page of your letter your initials and last name, street address or post-office box or “General delivery”, name of city, and state, to which you wish reply directed. Make all letters as brief and to the point as possible, and avoid all unnecessary letter writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DAILY RECORD SHEET</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These are furnished for your convenience in making out your monthly reports. Pioneers should use them also in keeping accurate record of their work in the territory on which they will report to this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO ORDER</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the present time the Society maintains three depots besides the Brooklyn office, for the purpose of filling orders, shipments being made from the following four points:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, 11 S. Newstead Ave., St. Louis, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3345 Fern wood Ave., Lynwood, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, 800 Broadway, Seattle, Wash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The states of Washington, Oregon and western Idaho are served by the Seattle depot; and California, Nevada, and western Arizona, by the Lynwood depot. Most of the rest of the country can be more economically served by Brooklyn, with the exception of Missouri points south of Hannibal and Kansas City, Arkansas points that cannot be served by boat and rail freight from Brooklyn, and those Illinois points within a radius of about forty miles of St. Louis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All orders should be sent direct to the Brooklyn office, 117 Adams Street. Only when rush orders are needed should the order be sent to the depot. Always try to anticipate your needed supply of literature far enough in advance to send your order to Brooklyn and allow it to be routed in the most economical way. At least two weeks should be allowed for freight shipments to points within 600 or 800 miles from the depots, and three or four weeks for distant points, from the time the order reaches this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In extreme cases where a telegraphic order is to be shipped by express or parcel post you may send your order direct to the depot nearest you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society’s policy is to prepay all charges on shipments and send them the cheapest way. The cheapest way is by freight, and if shipment by mail or express is desired, you will be charged the difference in transportation costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Endeavor to order in 100-pound lots, as freight charges are made on the basis of 100 pounds minimum weight, which means that the Society is charged just as much freight for a small shipment as if it weighed the full 100 pounds. Weight may be ascertained by figuring that 145 clothbound books weigh 100 pounds, or about 7/10 of a pound per book. One hundred booklets will average about 10 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mark each order as to the date the books will be needed, for our guidance in shipping them. If it is necessary to ship the order by express or parcel post instead of by freight in order to reach you In time, state specifically on the order to so ship; otherwise it will be sent by freight. If you receive mail at a post office where there is no freight depot, always give us the name of the nearest railroad depot when ordering books, as well as giving your mall address. On freight orders give the address to which the order is to be shipped. If you wish to be notified at another place, fill in that information. It is well to have orders shipped together, to make the weight 100 pounds; but orders to be shipped together must be sent in together. If you wish to have your order shipped with the order from some other person or company, send in all such orders to this office in one envelope, with definite shipping instructions marked at the top of each order. Call for freight shipments promptly on arrival, or arrange to have someone claim them for you. Storage starts on a shipment 48 hours after its arrival at the depot. If you are unable to claim the shipment within two days, notify the freight agent; and if you are leaving the territory, make arrangements with the freight agent before you leave regarding forwarding the shipment to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before accepting a shipment, be sure to see if there is any shortage or damage, and if so, refuse to receive it until the freight agent notes same in writing on the freight expense bill. All goods leave our hands in good condition, and you accept damaged goods at your own risk. Report to us Immediately all shipping charges and damaged shipments, sending us the original bill of lading along with the freight bill with the freight agent’s written notation on it. This procedure will greatly facilitate in the collection of damage claims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INFORMANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> is the monthly publication sent to all companies, pioneers and auxiliaries to inform all publishers as to what is to be done in carrying on the witness campaign. Every company should receive a sufficient number to supply all interested in the territory of the company, and the company servant should request additional copies of each issue when more are needed. It should be read and studied at the weekly service meetings. All activities of the company should be along the lines recommended in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Literature provided by the Society at special pioneer, auxiliary or company costs is really the property of the Society entrusted to the brethren. The company as a whole is responsible for the stock, and each publisher is to take care of it, keep it in good condition, and contribute as it is obtained, or as placed with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The policy is that any company publisher may have literature from the company stock at the contribution for which the Society furnishes it to the company, if the publisher is averaging two or more hours a week in the service. It is up to each individual to decide if he or she will contribute only company cost or more. No one in the company may withhold company rates on the literature from any publisher on the ground that the publisher is not getting in sufficient time, as the matter is between the individual and the Lord. If a publisher desires to contribute the entire amount he receives, he may, of course, do so. The company, however, has no right to vote that this must be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All literature is to be placed on the contribution established by the Society. Publications are not to be placed until released by the Society for public distribution. During the time certain books and booklets are specially stressed, these are to be used and left in all cases, if possible, and, of course, it is in order to place literature in addition thereto when there is an opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From time to time the Society may send literature on consignment to companies, or others, and may make large consignments to companies for storage without the companies’ having ordered it. These consignments and storage stock will be charged to the company account and are to be well taken care of, kept clean and dry and in good condition. The company may at any time place literature from such storage stocks, the same as from any part of the company stock. All orders are to be sent in by the company servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No leaflet, card or any other matter is to be inserted in the books or booklets, or placed in conjunction with the literature, and nothing is to be printed, stamped or written thereon, unless there is first obtained from this office permission for this to be done. The radio slips supplied by the Society, of course, are to be used in the door-to-door service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MONTHLY REPORTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every company servant, pioneer and auxiliary is required to submit a report to this office at the end of each month. Always use the report cards furnished by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">White cards are for company reports only. The company report is to include all company publishers and the results of their work, but not to include pioneers or auxiliaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pink cards are for the use of pioneers and auxiliaries only, reporting direct to this office only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Six items of information are asked for; namely:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(1) Total number of bound books (including Bibles) placed during the month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(2) Total number of booklets placed during the month (including booklets placed without contribution). Do not report sample copies of or subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(3) Number of company publishers taking part in the door-to-door service with the literature one or more hours during the month. As pioneers and auxiliaries are to report only their individual activities, they will leave this third space on their cards blank.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(4) Number of hours in actual field witnessing bringing the message to the people at their homes with literature and with sound equipment. Time witnessing from house to house with literature, and the time using sound equipment in conjunction with the placing of literature, are Included in the hours of field service. Every publisher should report his own work with sound equipment as stated above, regardless of who owns the equipment. In the case of company or individual machines, let each person using the equipment report the hours on daily report slips. If sound equipment is used by different companies during the month, each company reports its own work therewith. If two or more pioneers use one machine, each is to report his own hours of use of it. The one person operating the machine reports the time. Pioneers would also report their own work with machines owned by companies, or vice versa. Equipment privately owned by others than pioneers or auxiliaries should be reported through the company of which the owners are part. Time reported also includes phonograph and transcription machine back calls, and time spent in the people’s homes when delivering orders; all of this is time in the field service. However, time used for transcription series, phonograph series or study meetings is not reported at all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(5) Total number of persons obtaining literature during the month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(6) Total attendance at all sound machine meetings during the month.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">This should be those persons who hear a lecture for at least </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">4i</span><span class="font2"> minutes or more, but not to include the operators of the sound machines. This would include listeners to sound cars, PTM’s and phonographs, whether used in door-to-door witnessing, back calls or series of meetings held in homes with sound equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The activities for the entire month are to be reported in the upper row of spaces, including, of course, activities of any special testimony period during the month. The activities of special nine-day testimony periods are to be reported in the row of spaces marked “For SPECIAL PERIOD REPORT only”, and on the same card with the entire month’s report. Always check over your reports and send them in immediately at the end of each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLISHERS’ DAILY REPORT SLIPS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These are provided free to all companies asking for them. They are to be used by the brethren in reporting their work each day to the company servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SUBSCRIPTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> should be accompanied by remittance to cover. Here are a few hints that will aid to better service:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Always use special subscription blanks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sign </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font2"> name at the bottom, not the subscriber’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">State in a letter accompanying the blanks the names and addresses of the subscribers appearing thereon, so that in case of difficulty we shall have a record from which to make adjustment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do not send in more than one blank for each subscriber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do not use </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> blanks for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions, or vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you accompany subscriptions with remittance for more than enough to cover, the price of the subscription will be deducted from the remittance and the balance credited to your account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Company publishers are to send their subscriptions and renewals through the company organization or direct, and not through pioneers or auxiliaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SUPPLIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When additional order blanks, subscription blanks, or any other supplies, are needed, ask for these in your regular order for literature, as, generally, they can be sent along with your books and booklets. Pioneers and auxiliaries should use the special labels for ordering supplies, sending the labels in attached to their order for literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TESTIMONY CARDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Testimony cards are supplied to all the publishers, and each company servant is to see that a sufficient number of these are on hand. They are available in foreign languages as well as in English, and are for the purpose of aiding the publisher in the placement of the literature. When calling on one in the witness work, the publishers present the card, asking the one addressed to kindly read it carefully. A few appropriate remarks may be made in doing so if found advisable. After the card is read the publisher presents the literature referred to on the card, and, with such remarks as are necessary and appropriate, places this with the person on the established contribution. The publishers should always be equipped with the testimony cards, and their use is recommended, supplemented by further demonstration of the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the reverse side of the testimony card is the identification and authorization of the publisher. Each publisher should print his name on the first line (at the top), and at the bottom sign the name and also fill in the address. It is not necessary for every individual who reads the testimony card to read the back, but if he wishes to read it, let him do so. Tliis is to be used particularly In case of arrests or opposition on the part of policemen or other individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TRANSFERRING LITERATURE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You are not to turn over any books or booklets to another pioneer, auxiliary, or company or receive literature from any of these and expect an adjustment to be made on the accounts at this office without first receiving from this office permission for the transfer of stock to be made. If you run short of books before your order arrives from headquarters, and feel the need of borrowing a few from a company or another publisher, then replace the same at once upon the arrival of your shipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Company publishers should get their stock from the company stock, and not from pioneers or auxiliaries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Jonadabs</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Have in mind that the commandment of the Lord is that His message must be carried to the people of good will, otherwise known as “Jonadabs”. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> each issue, shows matters that are of present-day interest to the Jonadabs, and for this reason every Jonadab should be encouraged to subscribe for and receive </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and study each issue carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NEWLY INTERESTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When pioneers or others find interested persons these should be put in touch with the local company, so that they can take advantage of the company studies and be lined up with the local organization. The new radio folders, stamped by each company with the local address and phone number, will aid in this, and also the new study invitation slips. Each company should have a complete file of the names and addresses of all in the company and of all in the territory who are really interested, so that these latter can be contacted from time to time and aided to get into the organization if they so desire. When territory is assigned to publishers the names and addresses of interested ones in the territory may be furnished with the assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Persons really interested who are not in the territory of any company should be put in touch with this office as soon as possible, so that a new company can be organized. While in the territory, the pioneers can take these out in the service, and assist in establishing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies. The group should select one to act as chairman after the pioneer goes, so that the studies can continue. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">should be received by all such, and they will get this when enrolled as a company. They may make special request direct to be placed on the mailing list for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> prior to enrollment, if they desire. As soon as possible they should order literature direct from the Society. The activities of the newly interested working with pioneers should be reported to the Society, but are not to be shown on the pioneers’ report cards. Separate publishers’ slips should be made out and forwarded to the Society, showing their activity and the complete name and address.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Pioneers and Auxiliaries</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers are those who are giving their full time in house-to-house witnessing, serving Jehovah ‘with all their heart, mind and time’. They are special representatives of the Society in a close and confidential relationship to headquarters. These are appointed by the Society, after making proper application, and are responsible to the Society to fulfill the obligations laid upon them by their pioneer commission. The Society arranges for the special consideration which is given to these faithful witnesses and establishes the requirements which are to be met by them, and their primary obligation is to get in their time in the house-to-house service. The very minimum number of hours for pioneers is 110 each month, and this is to be exceeded in order that an effective witness may be given and the pioneer get on well. The pioneer service is not a secondary job of less importance than some secular work. To be a full-time publisher of Jehovah’s kingdom is the greatest of privileges and responsibilities, and a pioneer does not have time for all the odd jobs that come along and that would interfere with his getting in his pioneer hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All pioneers are assigned territory by the Society. When assigned to witness in conjunction with a company, they obtain their local territory from the company servant. A pioneer, however, makes all reports to the Society only, and not to the local company. It is necessary that each pioneer report regularly to the Society each month (even though kept out of the field work for some reason during the month), and also send in such territory reports as may be asked for at the time the territory assignment is made by this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Auxiliaries are also special representatives appointed by the Society, and the responsibility of auxiliaries, even as in the case of pioneers, is to the Society’s office in Brooklyn, to which all auxiliary reports are to be made each month. These brethren, while not devoting all their time to the service, or unable to get in pioneer hours, enjoy great privileges and blessings. All who can do so should change from the status of company publishers to that of auxiliaries or pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The minimum time for auxiliary service is 50 hours a month in the house-to-house witness. Most auxiliaries are serving in co-operation with various companies, obtaining their local territory from the company servant, but reporting to the Society only. It is entirely in order for brethren who are pioneers or auxiliaries to be elected as servants by the company with which they are associated, if the company wishes to do so and such service does not interfere with their getting in pioneer or auxiliary time and otherwise meeting their obligations as such.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Quotas</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">To aid the publishers in seeing the importance of time in the field, which will result in a witness in proportion to the effort and time spent, the Society has established the quota of 15 hours a month for all company publishers to strive for. If this cannot be reached, each publisher should, of course, do all he can ; but let each company establish a company quota based on the average of 15 hours per month per publisher. Of course, no one should stop at 15 hours a month if more time can be devoted to the service. Everyone taking part in the actual house-to-house witness during the month is to be reported as a publisher, regardless of whether he reached the quota of 15 hours or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The minimum time for pioneers is 110 hours a month, and the auxiliaries must spend at least 50 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">hours </span><span class="font2">a month in the service, in order to meet the requirements for these branches of the service. Every publisher who can spend 50 or more hours in the service should enroll as an auxiliary, and all who can spend full time in the witness work should enroll as pioneers. Pioneer and auxiliary service is not to be included in company quotas. Their reports are made direct to the Society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Service Meetings</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">There should be a weekly service meeting of all in the company. In very small companies of less than eight publishers, it may be found advisable to add half an hour or so to a study meeting for the service meeting. This is the meeting at which all the publishers come together for a study of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font2">discussion of service matter, special letters, ways and means of applying the instructions relative to field service and sound activity to the company territory and the participation of all the publishers therein, how the quota can be met, what can be done for the newly interested, etc. Plans for the week-end activity of the company can be completed, territory assigned, transportation decided upon, as well as witnessing on weekdays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The company servant is the chairman of the service meeting. Other members of the service committee should take part by prior arrangement and conduct the study and application of service instructions. Service meetings should be prepared and well arranged in advance by tlie company servant.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Sound Machine Activity</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPOSITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the Kingdom interests, we must do everything possible in meeting opposition, to keep the issue on the proper basis, which is the message of God’s kingdom. The brethren must not jeopardize the work by misconduct on their part. We can best serve the interests of the work by carefully planning our sound car service and carrying it out solely for presenting the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In covering a large area, it is well to be some distance away from the nearest house, so that good volume can be turned on and yet those near the sound car will not receive the message unduly loud and still the sound will carry for several blocks. When using the sound equipment adjacent to homes, have the volume turned up reasonably loud. Obey traffic regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The policy to be adopted on interference will be found in the September 1, 1935, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower:</span><span class="font2"> “Should Jehovah’s witnesses procure a license to operate a sound car where the ordinance requires such license?” Answer: “Yes; this is on the same principle as obtaining a license to operate an automobile. It is not asking for a license or permit to preach the gospel. A license to operate a sound car is in no wise contrary to God’s law. Where a sound car is to be used in the streets application should first be made to the police department and no doubt a permit or license will be issued.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Where this is denied, however, an effort should be made to obtain the use of some private property to put on your sound car meeting. In such cases, always endeavor to get permission in writing from the owner of the property to put on such meetings, so that the authorities will have no come-back on you from the standpoint of trespassing. Where neither license nor private property is available, the brethren have been getting good results by going outside the city limits and blanketing the town from some near-by hill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Avoid placing sound equipment near churches, theaters or any places where meetings are in progress. Be accommodating. If request is made to lower volume or move machine on account of sickness, people sleeping, etc., comply therewith. Do as you would be done by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PHONOGRAPHS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The phonograph is an important piece of sound equipment. Every publisher should certainly use it in his own home, running the lectures for those who call, and also take the phonograph with him in the house-to-house service when this is possible. It has been effectively used in the open for small crowds gathered around the car, attracted by a musical record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to using the phonograph in the regular house-to-house witness work, each company should arrange for back-call service. This work, carried on primarily in the evenings, is at homes where contact has been made in the regular house-to-house service with the literature at which time an appointment was made for the back call. Also regular territory may be selected and thoroughly covered from house to house with the phonograph and literature. These calls, if made between the hours of, say six to eight in the evenings, generally reach the entire family just after the evening meal, at which time several can hear the lectures. The brethren may set aside certain evenings each week for this particular service, having arranged the company studies so that all the brethren will be able to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In making back calls on parties previously contacted it is advisable for the publisher who previously called with the literature to return in person with the phonograph. If this cannot be done the name should be turned in to the sound servant, so that someone else can make the call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In covering a territory with the phonograph in the evenings, after introducing yourself, proceed in a manner similar to the method of presenting the literature and phonograph in your other house-to-house service. Several records may be run, and any questions the people have pertaining to the subject should be discussed with them. Show them where the matter is treated more elaborately in the literature, which they may wish to obtain. In some cases it may be necessary to go back with the phonograph a number of times. They may wish to invite some of their relatives and friends to hear some of the records and discuss the matter with them. On such occasions offer to loan them the phonograph for one or more evenings when you can spare it, when you believe they are sincere and will take proper care of the equipment. Ask them to keep record of the number of persons who hear, and this total may be included in the regular monthly report to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUND CARS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The new (Number 3) sound car equipment which the Society is at present manufacturing uses the new transcription machine which may be removed from the sound car and used at transcription meetings in the regular way, separate from the rest of the sound equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Good results are obtained in coordinating the sound car activity with the house-to-house witnessing by taking the sound car into the territory where the brethren are going from house to house with the literature, covering a portion of the territory with a lecture and announcements, and moving on to another portion, and repeating this throughout the area so that the entire section is covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TRANSCRIPTION MACHINES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No one of the Lord’s people should hesitate to open his home for transcription meetings. If each one assents to do this, there immediately become available in every company territory a large number of points where transcription meetings can be held. The various company headquarters should likewise be utilized for transcription service, and an unlimited number of other points, such as homes of interested people where phonographs have been used, funeral parlors, lodge homes, church and school houses, empty store buildings, municipal lodging houses, and a great number of places which can be obtained without charge by brethren who are on the alert for openings and present the matter properly before those having charge of such places. This equipment can also<sup>1</sup> be used outdoors in parks, vacant lots or in the streets, the same as a sound car.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Studies</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">A study of the current issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> should be available for every one in the company, likewise of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font2"> and in large companies several </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> studies may be established throughout the territory, so that newly interested persons may be invited to one conveniently near them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A study meeting should be an hour or an hour and a quarter in duration, as determined by the company. It should be opened by prayer by the chairman or someone on whom he calls. The chairman at each study selects someone who can read understandingly to read a paragraph or two. After the paragraph is read, let the chairman call for questions from anyone desiring to ask one. After a question is asked, the chairman should call upon two or three by name to give their answer. Then the chairman may say, “Does anyone else have a comment?” and then anyone may volunteer a comment. In this way the meeting will be orderly. All questions and comments should be brief and on the subject matter under consideration at that particular time. The chairman may ask for the questioner's own comment, who may have something to add to what has been said, and then the chairman may sum up the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is proper to have a juvenile </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> study, to which competent brothers or sisters should be appointed. The children should also be led and helped in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is recommended that there be no study or other meetings held for the publishers during the daytime on Sundays, but that all such meetings be held in the evenings, permitting the entire day to be spent in the service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Territory</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Company territory should be covered at least four times a year if this is possible. It may be covered more frequently, even once a month, to accomplish a more intense witness ; so companies that are going over their territory very often still have much work to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BUSINESS DISTRICTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As some of the brethren still seem to avoid the business territory, these sections are included in the company assignment only if specifically noted on the assignment sheet. Business districts refer to retail stores, offices, factories, water fronts, in fact, all but the residential territory of a city. Often, away from the main “downtown business section” are groups of business houses of all kinds, and these are also included in the term “business districts”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The company servant should see to it that neighborhood stores, service stations along the road, businesses located singly or in small groups throughout the residential or rural sections, or small country towns, are witnessed to, and the best way would be for the publisher having the adjoining residences to take these little stores as he comes to them. Let every company servant write the Society asking definitely for the business districts in their territory to be added to their assignment, if these are not already specifically noted on their assignment sheet; but only if they can thoroughly cover them frequently and efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Territory is assigned by counties, and by post-office towns and the intermediate rurals, and should always be referred to in that manner, as other local divisions, such as townships, rivers, roads, etc., are without value for our records. When a company is assigned a section of the county the post-office towns specified are assigned, and the rurals Intermediate are included. The rurals, however, do not extend beyond the county line. If the company can include additional towns in its work, the company servant should make request for increase in the assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SUBDIVIDING COMPANY TERRITORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A simple, efficient subdivision of the territory of companies is advisable, and most of the companies already have in effect such a system. To accomplish this a map system should be built up, which, though it may be varied according to the size of the company, should, in general, embrace the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MASTER MAP</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the service headquarters there should be the master map showing the entire territory of the company. If the territory is large enough to justify it, it should be first subdivided into zones, and then each zone into territories. In each case the territory should have a number identifying it, and each zone should be numbered. The number of the territory should indicate in which zone it is located; that is, in zone 1 the territories would be numbered 101, 102, 103, etc., and in zone 2, they would be 201, 202, 203, etc. For uniformity, number zones and territories from left to right, beginning across the top of the map. After such a map has been mounted and subdivided, its surface can be preserved by giving it a coat of shellac and then several coats of varnish, or by giving it two coats of glue sizing followed by two coats of clear lacquer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ZONE MAPS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If the territory is large enough to be zoned, a map similar to the master should be cut up into zones, each zone corresponding to the zone as outlined in the master map, and each one of these zone maps should be marked off into territories corresponding to the master map, and coated to provide a marking surface and preserve the maps. These zone maps can be used by zone servants, members of the service committee, they to assist the company servant in their assigned zone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TERRITORIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The territories themselves which are assigned to the publishers may be indicated on slips showing the boundaries and territory number or may be shown by pasting on a light card (bearing the territory number) each portion of a map which has been cut up into territories. Be sure the outside boundaries are plainly marked. This is optional. Brethren find that by typewriting the boundaries on the slips they have ample information for the assignment. The slips or cards are provided by the companies locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ASSIGNMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A iniblisher is given a territory assignment slip showing just what he is to cover, and on the zone map or the master map (or on both) this territory should be marked as having been assigned, so that at a glance it can he seen what territory is open and what is taken. This can be Indicated by making a line with a colored pencil on the territory on the zone map and master map. Pencils used for marking china are satisfactory for this, the marks being very easily erased with art gum. When an assignment is returned, the line indicating the assignment can be crossed with another line showing the territory to have been covered. If for any reason the territory assigned was not witnessed to, the line Indicating that the territory was assigned can be erased entirely, showing it not only is open, but has not been covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RURAL TERRITORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hural territory can be divided just the same as city territory, and the above suggestions can be used. It will be found that the map system is the most satisfactory in the assignment of rural territory, to insure the rural assignment’s being thoroughly covered on all the side roads as well as the main highways. Natural boundaries can be utilized in subdividing the rural territory. For fifty cents (money order to accompany your order) “Rural-Delivery Maps” for most counties can be obtained from Disbursing Clerk, Post Office Department, Washington, D.C.; or you may be able to procure detailed road maps locally. Be sure to cover all roads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RECORDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A record is to be kept showing to whom the territories are assigned and when last covered, so that they can be called in in sixty days after assignment is made if not returned completed by that time. This can be simply kept in a card file prepared by each company. Have a card about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">4i</span><span class="font2"> by G inches, a card for each territory, ruled on both sides with spaces for showing the name or initial of the publisher, date of assignment, and date returned, also if covered. These can be filed alphabetically in a drawer, and the territory slip and names and addresses of interested persons filed just in front of each card, so in one place there will be the slip given to the publisher when the assignment is made, names of interested persons, and the card on which the record of the assignment is kept. The use of end-open envelopes to hold the assignments and names and addresses is optional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The only territory report necessary from the publishers is the return of the assignment slip with report as to the thoroughness with which it was covered and when witnessed to. It is not necessary to keep a record of placements in the territories, and such would be needless waste of time and effort. Let the entire setup be simple, so that all the publishers will clearly understand it and so that all can get out in the field and not spend time unnecessarily in clerical work. Any data on the territory that will aid the next publisher, such as foreign literature needed, may be noted on the assignment slip.</span></p>

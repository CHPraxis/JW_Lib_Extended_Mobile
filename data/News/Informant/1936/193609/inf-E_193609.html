<p><span class="font1">The special offer of the three bound books on a contribution of fifty cents ends August 31. All books placed during the month, whether in tills special combination or singly, are to be reported in the regular way on the report card as total bound books placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the bottom of the report card each company servant and auxiliary must mark the number of three-book combinations placed during the month in order to get credit on account for these combinations. Pioneers already receive the books at the lowest rate, but the accounts of companies will be given credit of fifteen cents, and auxiliaries eighteen cents, for each three-book combination placed during August, only provided the number of combinations is shown at the bottom of the report card. If you do not give this information it is understood you do not want the credit. Each company servant should see that the publishers report tills information to him. Each six-book combination placed on a dollar contribution is to be reported as two three-book combinations.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Premiums</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">A number of the brethren throughout the country have been getting excellent results by accepting labels and coupons of different kinds, which are exchangeable for cash, as contributions for the literature. A full list of these appeared in a former </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font1"> We are pleased to advise that labels from Lion Brand Evaporated and Condensed Milks can also be used. However, these are not to be forwarded to the same place as the Octagon soap and other coupons are, but are to be forwarded to Nestle's Milk Products, Inc., Premium Department, headquarters at 4705 Metropolitan Ave., Brooklyn, N.Y., Attention: Miss J. Condit, Manager. The following rates apply on these labels:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">30c per 100 labels for the Full Size Evaporated Milk labels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">40c per 100 labels for the Condensed Milk labels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These labels can be accepted for literature and forwarded as instructed above, instructing the Nestle’s Milk Products, Inc., to forward to the Watch Tower, 117 Adams St.. Brooklyn, N. Y., a check covering the amount of coupons you forward, to be applied to your account.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What Is Your Part in This War?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>World-wide Quota 600,000 Hours for Nine Days</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">The time is drawing near for another concerted attack upon the Devil’s organization. Jehovah has given the command, “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.” This occasion is known as the &quot;Battle Shout”, October 3-11, 1936, and Jehovah’s faithful servants in every part of the world will join in this battle cry. No doubt you have all read Brother Rutherford’s “Personal Message” to Jehovah’s faithful servants in the September 1 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and have been moved to put forth a more strenuous effort during the coming witness than ever before. Brother Rutherford’s letter points out that we are in a real battle now, and “the time of preliminary war is here”. All those who love Jehovah should study that letter carefully and then make preparations for the greatest campaign to date to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> will again be offered during this period, on a contribution of 25c </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> has n&lt; w been translated and published in thirteen languages, and for the first time will be offered on a contribution of 25c no matter what language people speak. Here at the factory the presses have been running to the limit to turn out enough of these books in various languages to supply tire brethren for this special campaign. The demand for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches </span><span class="font1">continues to be exceedingly heavy, and to date over 1,700,000 copies have been printed and shipped out at Brooklyn alone. Hundreds of ihousands of copies are on their way to the branches of the Society so that Jehovah’s servants may move forward as one man with one book, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many people will have had </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches </span><span class="font1">by the time of the campaign, but that should not lessen our placements. On the contrary, it should help in placing more. Those who have read </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> will have mentioned it to their friends and neighbors, and many who turned it down the first time will now be anxious to get the book, and offering it again will increase the importance of the book in the minds of the people. Those who already have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches </span><span class="font1">should be invited to attend a study, using </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> as the text book. If in any language </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> is not available, then the latest book published should be offered. If one cannot contribute 25c and receive a bound book, then, on a contribution of 10c, offer three booklets, which should be the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing</span><span class="font1"> booklet, a selfcovered booklet, and any other colored-cover booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The newly Interested who have been attending </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> studies should be invited to participate In the witness work. These people should be aided in every possible way to get started as publishers of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUND ACTIVITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During tliis period as many transcription meetings as possible should be arranged, using the “Separating the Nations” lecture. In many places it will be possible to play this lecture for large outdoor gatherings as well as indoor meetings. In addition, the brethren should use the phonograph records wherever possible, both in door-to-door witnessing and in making back calls. Oftentimes the playing of only one record has resulted in the placing of a book which would otherwise have been impossible. No more than one or two records should be played at any one place while witnessing. If the party is interested, arrange for a back call in the evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">QUOTA</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is always well to have a quota of hours in mind for these special periods. Last April we reached a peak in publishers, but not the peak in hours. There were 46,209 publishers in the field, throughout the world, and these put in a total of 489,011 hours witnessing. For the coming period it is suggested that we aim at a quota of 50,000 publishers putting in 600,000 hours. That would be a nice increase over the last period, wouldn’t It? However, it is not difficult if each publisher takes the responsibility upon himself to do his share. There should be throughout the entire world 3,500 pioneers averaging 40 hours each for the nine days, 1,500 auxiliaries having an individual quota of 20 hours each, and 45,000 company publishers putting forth an earnest endeavor to average 10 hours each. If we do this we shall pass the 600,000 hours. Think what a witness can be given if each publisher puts in his share of the above quota! Remember, the individual goal is. pioneers 40 hours, auxiliaries 20 hours, and company publishers 10 hours. If each one does this, then in the United States we should expect 25,000 company publishers putting in a total of 250,000 hours, 1,000 auxiliaries with a total of 20,000 hours, and 2,000 pioneers with 80,000 hours, or a grand total for the United States of 350,000 hours. It is well to have in mind that the “Battle Shout” starts off our new fiscal year, too.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Important Notice</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Send In Your September Report on the 27th</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">September is the last month of the fiscal year, and the year's report must be completed immediately thereafter. To get the report ready in time, it will be necessary to cut September’s work short; so end your September work with Sunday the 27th. Your report for October will include September 28 to October 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each company servant, pioneer and auxiliary is to mail his report for the twenty-seven days to this office Sunday evening, September 27, and those company servants west of the Mississippi river will aid very much by sending their reports by air mail. This means that all company publishers are to get their reports to the company servant before Sunday evening, so that their work will be included in the company report mailed at that time. If it should be that there are some publishers who fall to do this, the company servant is not to hold up the report by waiting for these, but is to send the company report right on, and include, such late ones the following month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is very important. Let everyone mail the report promptly on September 27.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Inventory</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">Eacli company, pioneer, and auxiliary is required to take an exact inventory of stock as of September 30. Additionally, each one is to send in the complete report of said Inventory to the Society by October 10, on the special blank enclosed for this very purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Care is to be taken to see that the inventory blank is properly filled out, particularly that the “totals” and “values” called for are figured out correctly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The companies and auxiliaries that want credit for the change in costs on foreign bound books must make request for it by properly showing on the inventory, under the heading “Remarks”, the amount needed to adjust the account. Companies are being allowed a credit of 6c on each foreign bound book; auxiliaries, 3c. Be sure that the credit you ask for checks with the total foreign bound books reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our responsibility in this battle is great. The Lord has given each one of us a definite assignment in his army, and if we are good soldiers we will, as Brother Rutherford stated in his letter, “be ready to enter the field on the first day and continue therein until the last, and as you go be joyful in the Lord.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Petition Grows</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Many Waiting to Sign</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>“Be Strong, and Work”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wobk in the strength of Jehovah is now seen by His witnesses and their companions as needful to serve everyone who is worthy to sign the petition. Great numbers have signed. Others are eager to sign. Jehovah’s publishers are privileged to see that such persons have opportunity to sign. So let us work on with redoubled determination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember, for the entire month of September, carry on the petition work in conjunction with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font1"> regular witnessing and in special campaigns. (Pioneers continue to give first attention to their regular duties, introducing the petition when opportune.) Serve particularly all city territory, including business and residential sections. Aim to complete the petition work by September 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember, at each home and business place, fibst present the green card and petition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That being disposed of, then introduce the booklets being offered during September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Take the August </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> and carefully review the outline of cooperation there shown, for the petition work. Be certain-that you are proceeding with every feature of this work in a fitting and thorough manner. Do not neglect to make this examination now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">USE OF TIME</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thoughtful use of time spent in the field will enable publishers to serve many during September with the opportunity to sign the petition. Pass as quickly as possible from home to home, always alert to find persons of good will. Serve them and pass on promptly to find and serve others of such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember the suggested </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">average </span><span class="font1">per publisher, 350 petition signers served. Generally, this work began during the fourth week of July, thus allowing ten full weeks to the end of September. On that basis, each publisher’s individual weekly quota of petition signers served is 35. Have you agreed with another publisher to serve, jointly, by the Lord’s grace, a combined total of at least 700 signers ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">AIDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Here and there the Catholic press and the clergy presume to “warn” people concerning the petition. Such warnings serve, naturally, to advertise the coming of the publishers who bear the petition to the people. Have in mind, then, that fair-minded Catholics, as well as many non-Catholics, expect your call with the petition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Page 31, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing</span><span class="font1"> booklet, may be shown to aid any questioner to understand that the Nazi aim and the Hierarchy’s aim are one and the same. Others particularly relish the clearly stated issue: “If the message Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing to the people is true, then it is of the greatest importance to mankind. If it is false, then it is the duty of the clergymen who thus claim to come boldly forward and plainly tell the people wherein that message is false. The radio is the best means to thus reach the people at large.” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Crisis</span><span class="font1"> booklet, page 41) The time to ‘call the bluff’ of scornful men is here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In some instances persons whose sympathies lie with the lords of the Hierarchy have been moved to act violently against those who present the petition. Such rare cases stand</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">out in bold contrast, however, to J the large percentage of even the so-called “Catholic population” whe are signing the petition because they long to hear the truth plainly spoken, so listeners may judge and choose intelligently. No longer can it be said that ‘the bishop decides for his people what they shall or shall not hear’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the part of publishers, essentials for this work are “patient continuance in well doing”, never-flagging zeal for Jehovah and his truth, and firmness and kindness in dealing with every situation as met. Jehovah’s commission (Isaiah 61:1-3) to his anointed witnesses authorizes them to make known the good news to the meek. The meek willingly listen to learn, that they may go in the way of truth, to Jehovah’s praise. Presentation of the petition to such persons of good will affords them opportunity to go on record as to their appreciation of righteousness, fair play. All such, whether Catholic or non-Catholic, must learn and obey God’s requirements in order to live. Daily the issue is being more clearly seen and declared: It is tkuth versus falsehood ; Jehovah’s Word against the entrenched lies fathered by Satan and his Hierarchy’s scornful leaders whose conspiracy against Jehovah’s anointed has been inspired by Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Companies having large quantities of filled petition sheets to send to Brooklyn at end of September may send them by express, insured.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">The August Special Issue of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> stated that its contents are to be studied carefully by the publishers. As this is done the organization and its operation will be clear in the minds of the brethren, and this will be greatly to their advantage and to the interests of the Kingdom service. Note that the new manner of counting time begins October 1, or, more specifically, September 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It will be readily seen that those brethren who used to be listed under the designation of “sharpshooter” are now to proceed as company organizations. Their local work is to be organized and carried out as outlined in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> and thus more efficient and effective service can be rendered to the honor of Jehovah’s name.

</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Plenty of Work Before the New One Begins</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">During September the Lord’s people everywhere will be making a careful check on their year’s activity. They are vitally concerned about the Kingdom interests committed into their care, and all will want to know how their individual and collective activity compares with former years and the quota for this year. Individuals and companies will want to make this the greatest witness year to date.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>After October 1</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Riches</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in All Languages on 25c Contribution</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">RICHES I</span><span class="font1"> All ‘kindreds and tongues’ need it. It is rapidly being translated into many tongues, and at present is available in Afrikaans, Bohemian, Danish, English, French, German, Greek, Hollandish, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. All publishers who witness among foreignspeaking people should have literature in the various languages, and this can be readily placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You will be very glad to know that after October 1, 1936, you can place </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> in any language on a contribution of 25c. This change is being made to aid in a wider distribution of the Kingdom message, and the contribution of 25c applies not only to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font1"> but, in addition, to all the bound books that Brother Rutherford has written, from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font1"> to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> inclusive, in any and all languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The publishers were previously sent the English testimony card for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font1"> This is now translated into all languages in which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> is available, and offers </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> on a 25c contribution. We shall be glad to supply these foreign testimony cards on your order. They are not to be used until October 1, of course, as the foreign books are placed on a 35c contribution until then. Be sure that the testimony card you use states the proper contribution at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Be sure to order now all the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> you need for October and November. Stockkeepers, company servants, check your </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font1"> and order. You’ll need them in October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and the recommendation sent to this office. All these recommendations are to be in by the first of September, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It will be readily seen also that in the selection of brethren in the companies for the duties of study chairmen and other work the thing to be considered is the work to be done and who can do it well. There is no reason why a company or service committee should select one to be a study chairman, or to some other such duty, just because he has been in the truth for a long time and will feel slighted and hurt if lie is not appointed, when there is someone else more capable who might be selected. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font1">calls attention to the proper manner of choosing workers in the company organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let all the publishers work orderly, and harmoniously, and perform their part in Jehovah’s service organization. er, what are you doing to gather up the slack and make 1936 the banner year to date?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These questions each one who has the interests of the Lord’s work at heart will ask himself and answer as unto Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your equipment for September is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing</span><span class="font1"> and one other coloredcover booklet and a self-covered booklet, on a contribution of 10c, in conjunction with the petition campaign. Let each one, therefore, look well to his Kingdom interests and finish the year with a grand witness to the praise of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Soiled Literature</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">From time to time complaints are received because of the careless manner in which some brethren handle the literature entrusted to them on credit, and of their habit of returning to the company stock soiled books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tlie arrangement of allowing a publisher a limited supply of literature on credit is to aid him to have a full share in the witness. Each one who takes literature under this arrangement automatically obligates himself to remit to the treasurer for this stock as placed or, if he cannot place it, return it within a reasonable time in first-class condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The stockkeeper is not to take back soiled literature from anyone. Each one who soils literature is responsible for placing it and remitting in full therefor. In fairness to all, the company should see that this rule is strictly enforced.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Relative to Radio Service</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">It is well for the brethren to write to the radio stations that broadcast the lectures of Brother Rutherford, expressing from time to time how well the programs come over, and manifesting appreciation of the broadcasts. Y’ou may write, not only to the local radio station in your particular territory, but to more distant stations as well. Sometime check up the list of stations on the radio folder, tune in on a more distant one, and then, after hearing the lecture, write the station. All the brethren and all people of good will may do this from time to time, so that the stations themselves will know that the programs are appreciated. This should be done in a businesslike manner.</span></p>

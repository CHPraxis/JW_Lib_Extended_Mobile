<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Fearless Activity Outlined for the Future</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>September Features Three-Booklet Offer</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup>An important work has been assigned to the servants of God. It is important because upon their faithfulness to their assignment depend their lives and the lives of those who hear and heed them. The time in which to accomplish this work, making known Jehovah’s name and purpose, is limited. Small wonder, then, that Paul’s counsel to Timothy, “Stick to your work” (1 Tim. 4:16, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt),</span><span class="font1"> is again brought forcefully to our attention. It was important for Timothy and is now infinitely more important for us not to ‘grow weary in well-doing’, but rather to continue steadfastly to do our work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Past devotion to our work under both favorable and unfavorable conditions has brought outstanding results. With ever-increasing crescendo new peaks have followed one another. Encouragement through the “faithful and wise servant” for further increases has been met with increased zeal, planning and effectiveness. The resultant new peaks were therefore not accidents. They were a manifestation of Jehovah’s blessing upon sincere efforts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Working for a Peak</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> But potentials for even further publisher peaks continue to exist around us. Do not the long-time publishers still possess that zeal and determination that pressed them into service in the past? And are they not now assisted by literally thousands of eager new witnesses of Jehovah? It would not seem improper, then, to seek to begin our new service year with a new peak of publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> To work intelligently toward a peak one must realize where the increases come from. This growth is not a mysterious something that other companies have but yours does not. These thousands of new publishers are made up of that man on the street that showed interest in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> and was invited to a public lecture; the family who subscribed for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and upon whom an alert publisher called back; the woman who had been attending meetings for years but had never before been really helped into the service. Does not a check of your company show these same people to be among you? Then your company, too, can have a new peak if you diligently stick to the work of aiding them to advance to maturity of knowledge and appreciation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>B</sup> But if the potential number seems too low, further questions may be in order. Are you </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">working</span><span class="font1"> from door to door so as to contact good will? Are you participating whole-heartedly in house-to-house work with the magazines as well as on the street corner? Do you </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">really</span><span class="font1"> follow up the Interest? And after making your back-calls do you conscientiously endeavor to establish studies and continue to aid these people to get out into the work themselves? Your answers may suggest need for improvement. But though you are working hard and still no increases have resulted, there is no need for discouragement. Jehovah will bless you with expansion in his due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Booklet Work to Aid</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> September’s offer will be three booklets, one of which should be colored-cover, on a contribution of 10c; and if any of the brethren have brought new booklets with them from the New York assembly these may be included in the offer. Experience has shown that it is relatively easy to place such an offer, and many interesting experiences result. New publishers will therefore find it encouraging and easy to start out in the booklet work. In their initial service, perhaps you might suggest that they hold the booklets and then present them to the householder after you have given a brief oral witness of introduction. Be helpful in every way possible; a real considerate shepherd to them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Organize Company Book Studies for Booklet Work</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> Through the company book studies as working units, the booklet work can be stimulated. Company servants, check with the study conductors to see that definite steps are taken to establish the company book study as a point of contact where publishers can go out in the evening booklet work for perhaps an hour ■ before the study. An additional evening might be set aside for booklet work also since many persons can then be found at home who are otherwise at their places of business. Usually they are found to be more receptive at this time of day. Where booklet placements are made, this should be noted and back-calls made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> September is usually a good month to work rural areas that are not accessible at other times of the year. Companies that have such territory should include plans for covering as much as possible during the open months.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup> It is suggested that early in the month a list of the irregular publishers be made. After aiding these into the service, the latter half of the month can be devoted to aiding as many new ones as possible. Regular publishers can be assigned to assist these individuals through the study conductors. Do not be coercive, but show real consideration and interest toward these brethren.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>10</sup> The Lord is now accomplishing the gathering of his “other sheep”. It is our joyful privilege to invite them to “come” and drink freely of the truths which have so refreshed us. Giving us added determination to continue in the good work we have begun are the ringing words of the apostle, “Stick to your work I”</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Kingdom Publishers Equipped for</span><br><br><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>New World Living</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> As this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> goes to press, New York, the world's greatest city, is still talking about the world's greatest convention, the 1950 Theocracy’s Increase Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. The spectacle of thousands of peaceable servants of God from 67 nations day after day packing out the mammoth Yankee Stadium, a combined total of 123,707 hearing Brother Knorr deliver the public talk “Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth?” caused New York, the nation and the world to admit that “something of moment is taking place in our town”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> If this great gathering of Christians so impressed outside observers, how much more must it have affected those who attended the sessions ! What were some of their impressions? Not one could fail to note the predominant theme, the increase and other signs pointing to the nearness of the old world’s end and the need for clean, reaness, uncompromising activity in the few remaining years. And why should we fear? The Theocracy is here and its King is ruling in our midst!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> Crystal clear now is the line of demarcation between God’s organization and the Devil’s. Communism or any other scheme of world government holds no attraction. The sinking ships of religion, politics and commerce are present snares to encroach upon our service and tie us to the old world. Though men may soon endeavor to restrain us from Kingdom service, we will be determined to continue to serve God, underground if necessary; and, when Jehovah brings final release at Armageddon, we will step forth from shattered places of detention, free and fully organized for New World living.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> Throughout the assembly the witnesses were repeatedly urged to stick to their work, to lay’ aside burdens which retard their service, to remain close to and progress with the organization, the only existing new world society. A thrilling high point was the startling revelation that many of the other sheep now on the earth who continue on. in Jehovah’s service and prove their integrity right down through Armageddon may be privileged to share in the role of “princes in all the earth”. How important, then, to care well for the Kingdom interests placed in our hands!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Equipped for New World Living</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Further, Jehovah’s witnesses were here equipped for New World living as they have never been before. What was probably the most significant convention release of all time, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">With wishful promises as a sedative, world leaders put to sleep those they control. In a heady stupor thej go on indifferent to the near approach of the final end of this world. However, Jehovah will have all men know that the world's destruction at Armageddon is nearer than they think. The declaration of this warning and its result were long ago foretold, “Howl ye, for near is the day of Jehovah, as destruction from the Mighty it cometh.” (Isa. 13:6, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Young)</span><span class="font1"> But what can we use to arouse them from their worldly slumber and effectively ‘declare the day of vengeance of our God and comfort all that mourn’?

Each copy carries within its 32 uncensored pages a rousing warning to awake to the signs that mark the end of this old world, and at the same time holds high the sure hope of a new and righteous world. It is a real friend, exposes our enemies and contends for freedom for all. Truthful, colorful, interesting, enlightening is the magazine </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!; </span><span class="font1">and during October we will present to the people a one year’s subscription, on the contribution of $1.00.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Advance Preparation Necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Servants should order needed distributors' copies and subscription slips early. Line up territory and organize for group witnessing in unworked sections. Arrange instructive service meetings with practical demonstrations on how to present the offer and overcome the objections peculiar to your territory. It would be well to again review the instructions on the sheet “How to Properly Handle Subscriptions”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Publishers, equip yourselves by attending these meetings. Further prepare by reading </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! so</span><span class="font1"> that you will know its contents and can use this knowledge in its presentation. Be ready to take subscriptions in the store-to-store and street work, on magazine routes, from house to house, on back-calls and Bible studies ; and don't forget your neighbors and friends. Each publisher should thus easily attain the quota of one subscription for the month, and pioneers one each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Keep a record of all who subscribe, so back-calls can be made to cultivate the interest found. From the first day of October to the last, do your best. Lovingly help others into the service. Let all know that Armageddon is nearer than they think. Thus you will serve for Jehovah’s vindication and the salvation of all who love righteousness.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Debates</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Occasionally individuals or groups in various parts of the country, who are usually interested primarily in gaining publicity for themselves, challenge Jehovah's witnesses to participate in debates. As a result, the question of whether or not to accept such challenges comes to the minds of the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Knowing as we do that the Scriptures are of no private interpretation and that Christian doctrine is not established by debating, we should not feel under any obligation to accept a challenge to debate. If a person honestly wants to know the truth, he is willing to sit down and dispassionately consider what God's Word has to say. Otherwise, his interest manifestly is to propagate his own ideas, and not to hear and learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a debate as much error as truth is presented and the hearers, frequently moved by oratory and eloquence of speech, are prone to base their decision upon the showmanship of the Individual rather than upon God’s Word. Certainly little opportunity is afforded them to ‘prove all things’ by comparing the Scriptures with what is said. The truth can be much more effectively presented by going from house to house, contacting the sheep and holding regular Bible studies with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The final decision, of course, must be made by the local company. If the brethren should take it upon themselves to participate in a debate, they should go ahead and complete the arrangements, accepting the responsibility they have assumed and preparing diligently so as to be able to refute errors likely to be advanced as well as to present the truthful and Scriptural viewpoint. It accomplishes little to write the Society for counsel after such arrangements have already been made.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Company and Pioneer Supplies</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Supplies for the coming service year for both pioneers and companies are enclosed with this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font1"> Supplies for companies are report cards for each month of the service year and a Company Progressive Report sheet; for pioneers, report cards for each month and Daily Record Sheets; for special pioneers, monthly Report and Allowance Request forms and Daily Record Sheets. Those special pioneers who use them will also be sent report cards for the President’s Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All other forms should be ordered in the regular manner as they are needed. Instructions relative to proper reporting will be found in paragraphs 32 to 42 of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization.</span><span class="font1"> These instructions could be profitably reviewed by the entire company as well as by pioneers at this time.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Field Service Report</span></h4>

Field service reports for both July and August will appear in the October </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Since the Spanish </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> is now semimonthly, distributors’ rates are now the same as for the Spanish </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower:</span><span class="font1"> a paid distributors’ subscription of 5 copies, $3.75 a year; 10 or more copies of an issue to one address, 3c a copy; single copies, 5c each.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Field Service Chart, 1950-52</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Each company is now being sent a new company chart covering the next two service years, beginning September 1, 1050. Included with each is an instruction sheet which describes how to obtain the proper figures to post on the chart. The assistant company servant should study these instructions carefully and immediately put up the necessary information, sueh as the monthly averages for last year and the new 10-percent-increase quotas for the coming year. Most companies are being sent ungummed numbers due to previous difficulty when numbers stuck together in the mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As soon as the company report is compiled each month it should be posted on the chart. An analysis of the chart should be included on the service meeting program each month. This will enable the company to discern where progress is being made as well as to discover weaknesses which should be remedied by the company in order to maintain a balanced field service program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If each publisher will keep a close watch on the company’s progress as revealed by the chart and then put forth a personal effort to help the company improve where necessary, Jehovah will add his blessing</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Company Book Studies</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Equip for Efficient Home Bible Studies</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">The company book study plays an important part in our progress to Theocratic maturity. When properly arranged and supported by the publishers it becomes the very heart of Theocratic growth in that locality, whether rural or urban. It is a center for acquiring Kingdom information and equipping the publishers to more effectively serve the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All Theocratic-minded persons who have hope for life in God’s kingdom will welcome the opportunity to study together and discuss the advanced Kingdom light contained in the new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”.</span><span class="font1"> The Society recommends that all company book studies change to a study of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font1"> as soon as the publishers have their personal copies, so that they may become familiar with its contents for later use in the field. The company book study is the place to become equipped for your future service with this wonderful instrument ; therefore, all are strongly urged to attend and support it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The manner in which the study is conducted determines to a great extent how effective it will be. The study conductor should be well prepared by thorough and careful study of the lesson so that the main points will be clear in his own mind. He should encourage all to comment at the study. This will include new at-tenders and children, who might be reluctant to comment unless encouraged to do so. It is not necessary for the conductor to repeat or sum up all the comments on the paragraph. This will have a tendency to discourage those commenting, because they may feel their comments were unsatisfactory. If the point is not made clear by comments from those present, then the conductor should add whatever is necessary to clarify it. It is best for the conductor to encourage the brethren and those present to do the commenting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A company book study well conducted and supported is lively and a joy to the heart of all in attendance. It will deepen the impression of the truth on our minds as well as encourage us to dig for new truths. It reveals new points for our use in field service. Hence, the publishers should not only support this study, but also encourage persons of good will in that vicinity to attend with them and share in the spiritual feast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Home Bible studies may be changed over to the study of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life&quot;</span><span class="font1"> as soon as you wish. However, if only a few chapters remain to be covered in the book you are now studying, especially if it is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font1"> then it is suggested that you finish it before changing to the new book. It is well to keep the study within the hour, whether it is a company book study or a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In unison, we, as Jehovah’s consecrated ministers, will push on in this grandest work on earth. We are thankful for each provision our Creator makes for our service to him. Let us show this appreciation by supporting the company book studies and making the most effective use of our new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”.</span></p>

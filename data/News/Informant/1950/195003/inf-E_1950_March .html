<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Preparation for Memorial Activity Climaxes Month</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">What a comfort it is to know that one can work out his salvation by good works I This merciful provision through Christ from the Provider of all good things makes honest-hearted persons doubly happy, for not only can they serve and please Jehovah, but also they can receive the satisfaction of aiding others to appreciate his mercy. Exercising this godlike quality of mercy is profitable, for Christ Jesus told the assembled multitude, “Happy the merciful; for they shall receive mercy.”—Matt. 5: 7, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This happiness is so clearly manifested by Jehovah’s servants. Their pleasing countenance, their sincere desire to help truth seekers, their regularity in service: these are quickly noticed by those to whom they minister, and they are moved to investigate. Out of the Bible come the answers to their questions, and at the same time an opportunity is afforded to show the merits of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> the magazine which, through the pages of the Bible, reveals the true source of happiness. Joyfully we will continue to present the subscription offer during March. A subscription obtained or a single copy placed can be a real steppingstone to an appreciation of Jehovah’s mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many opportunities for obtaining subscriptions will be encountered in the various features of Magazine Day activity. Conscientiously endeavor to take part in the different ways of distributing the magazines and be on the alert for subscription prospects. When making Magazine Day arrangements, keep in mind that in some places it may be necessary to arrange store-to-store magazine witnessing on some day other than the one used for street or house-to-house witnessing with the magazines. Local conditions will indicate the best time for each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All the brethren should support Magazine Day, making effective use of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> magazines, and endeavoring to obtain subscriptions therefor. In participating in magazine distribution, however, the publisher should not neglect other features of the service. Apportioning time to all fields of activity will insure blessings from each and more enjoyable service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Become Familiar with Each Issue</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When preparing for effective presentations, the importance of being familiar with each issue of the magazines cannot be overemphasized. Only then can one illustrate how beneficial </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> can be to one who is searching for the truth or who has Bible questions that he desires to have answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For example, in demonstrating the presentation of the March 1 issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> entitled “A Call to Praise”, one might point out from paragraphs 10 and 11 the practical reason why men should praise Jehovah: not to guarantee a temporary life of 60 or 70 years but to obtain life eternal through Jehovah and his Son. How is this salvation guaranteed? “With the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” No deathbed repentance with the coming of Armageddon will suffice; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font1"> is the time to consider the profitable course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Upon all Kingdom publishers who have already learned of God’s merciful provisions rests the responsibility to teach others. Obtaining subscriptions for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and then aiding the subscribers to appreciate the heart-cheering contents is an excellent way of doing this. As each one demonstrates his good works in this regard, the company will be able to meet its subscription quota of twice the peak number of publishers. March 1 marks the half-way point of the campaign. Do you have half of your quota? Redeem the time; present </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font1"> meet or exceed the quota!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Plan Now for Memorial</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As announced in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font1">the Memorial will be April 1. Each company should begin now to prepare for this event and a full weekend of service activity. Some qualified consecrated person, preferably of the anointed, should be appointed to deliver the discourse. Personal invitations to attend should be extended to all associated and those of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The service meeting prior to the Memorial should be well prepared, with suggestions offered for profitably devoting the Memorial weekend to service. The arrangements should include a full day of field service on Saturday, at which time Sunday’s public meeting also will be advertised. All arrangements should be clearly outlined in advance, and everyone should be invited and encouraged to participate. Saturday evening all will assemble for the Memorial service. The program will conclude with service announcements for Sunday’s activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Group witnessing Sunday morning will precede the public meeting and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study. Good-will persons attending the Memorial should be encouraged to continue their profitable beginning on the road to life. Aid them, where necessary, to associate regularly and begin ‘confession unto salvation’. Circuit servants should adjust their schedules to fit in with local arrangements at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember, our goal is 100,000 publishers by convention time. New peaks in March and April will do much toward attaining it as we continue in the field unitedly proclaiming Jehovah’s merciful purposes.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Distribute Back-Issue Magazines</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Do your magazines accumulate on shelves, inside desks and book bags or elsewhere? As you regularly secure a new supply of magazines are some added to this already growing pile? Or do you thoughtlessly destroy back issues to keep them from accumulating? Careful consideration should be given to these questions, and then concerted action should be taken to eliminate any indication of waste. We cannot afford to waste the good represented in even one of our magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Conditions which lead to accumulation of the magazines should first be eliminated. Companies and pioneers should carefully regulate and obtain the number of magazines that are actually needed for field service. The company can do this if each publisher orders in advance the magazines he needs, and then faithfully takes his allotment of each issue as it is received, striving to place them all week by week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But what of those already on hand? Keep in mind that only soiled, torn, badly creased or discolored issues should ever be destroyed. All others should be put to good use, furnishing food to truth-hungry people. Baek issues, even though a year old, can be distributed as samples; on the street corner to those who are curious or unable to contribute and in the door-to-door work with those who do not take advantage of the current offer. Back issues can also be left on back-calls, perhaps opening a way for obtaining subscriptions. Others may be utilized in our personal libraries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If each one in the company is mindful of the value of the magazines, never treating them as common and always putting forth every effort to get them distributed, each magazine can accomplish the most good in preaching the Word.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>“Preach the Word” as a Pioneer</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The Kingdom message which we bear is urgently needed for men to have life. That is why Paul told Timothy, “proclaim the word, be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">urgent</span><span class="font1"> seasonably, unseasonably.” (2 Timothy 4:2, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font1"> Both Paul and the young man he was here instructing were sufficiently convinced of the urgency of the message to devote their entire time to it. They preached the Word as pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the months and years slip quickly by, preaching the Word becomes even more urgent, calling for greater diligence, more preachers and a larger portion of the time of the servants of God. The 1950 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">'Yearhook</span><span class="font1"> shows that during 1949 there were 12,424 pioneers; men, women and children who set aside worldly cares, responsibilities and pleasures to be full-time preachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Throughout the world there are yet many thousands whose hearts direct them to be in the pioneer ranks. Already some of these are responding to the call for pioneers that appeared in the February </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font1"> Undoubtedly others have thought, “Yes, I </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">should</span><span class="font1"> be a pioneer; perhaps sometime in the future I will.” For them the joys and privileges of pioneer service are put off until an indefinite “tomorrow”. But who knows what tomorrow holds for them? A message that is urgent calls for action today. A “tomorrow” when you will preach the Word as a pioneer will not automatically come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such a day may come, however, if you set a definite time when you purpose to begin pioneering and then endeavor to let nothing prevent you from doing it. Be assured that the adversary will raise circumstances to hinder you; he considers his cause urgent too, for his time is very short. But such obstacles can be overcome. Through faith and prayer, planning and determination you can be a pioneer. There are thousands of living examples that prove this to be true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Paul was near the end of his pioneer service when he wrote to Timothy about the urgency of preaching. But he did not consider distressing circumstances such as imprisonment, chains and coming death to be sufficient reason to slack his pace: and he urged Timothy to take advantage of all “seasons” or opportunities to preach the Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By far the majority of God's servants today face the joyful prospect of continued service right into the new world, with joys increasing with each forward step toward greater service. To them too, however, comes the exhortation, “be urgent, seasonably, unseasonably.” The more time one devotes to preaching the nearer he comes to satisfying his desire and the Creator’s instruction to preach at every opportunity. Would you not like to thus expand your service now by preaching the Word as a pioneer? An application will be sent immediately upon your request.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Announcing Messiah’s Presence”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Express Appreciation During April Testimony Period</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>The Convention Is Drawing Near!</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Are You Prepared?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Before entering the “Announcing Messiah’s Presence” Testimony Period, it is fitting for those who have received knowledge of the truth from Jehovah to pause and give serious thought to the significance of the commission to announce glad tidings. What does Messiah’s presence mean to us? What does it mean to our families? Our neighbors? Our friends? As we dwell on this matter we realize that every human creature on this planet is affected by this great event that all the signs indicate has taken place.—Matt. 24: 37, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This knowledge of Messiah’s presence, which means peace of mind and hope for the future, reached us because someone else announced it in our hearing. Now that it has been entrusted to us, how are we going to use it to the greatest advantage? There should be only one answer: We will show forth the praises of our merciful God, comforting others with the ‘comfort wherewith we have been comforted’.—2 Cor. 1: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Provision for Announcing</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Adequate provisions and needed assistance for sharing in the announcing work are available for each one of us at the Kingdom Hall or company headquarters. To take full advantage of such we will attend service meetings and other company meetings, assemble with other announcers for group witnessing and generally participate in carrying forward the work of announcing Messiah’s presence. Each minister will do this if he really believes and appreciates the day in which we live and the importance of this worthwhile work.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Use of the Kingdom Hall</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The Kingdom Hall is the center of Bible study and Kingdom activity for the community. There Jehovah’s witnesses meet for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> studies, service meetings, Theocratic ministry school, public lectures and other meetings, so as to be better equipped for the grand work of the ministry. There, too, the meek of the earth, whom the publishers find while engaged in the various features of service, are ultimately invited. They associate with us in study at the Kingdom Hall to more fully learn the will of the Lord and to do that will by active service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We should never feel hesitant or apologetic about inviting others to our Kingdom Hall. If our hall is neat, clean and attractive we are proud to bring people of good-will to it. Paragraph 73 of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization</span><span class="font1"> states that the company servant should oversee its maintenance. He should check to see that all unnecessary charts, texts, signs, and any other distracting things, are removed from the walls. A territory map, department signs, library sign, as well as an outside identifying sign “Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses”, are appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A neat arrangement of furniture, chairs, desks and counters also adds to its attractiveness. By keeping all these things tidy and in order, the appearance of the Kingdom Hall will reflect the dignity of Jehovah’s kingdom message, and your Kingdom Hall will be a real asset to the local company organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Appreciating the place the Kingdom Hall occupies in the community</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The public meeting series provides an excellent medium of announcing Messiah’s presence, and all companies and those associated will desire to support the 1950 series which begins after April 1. One of the most notable public meetings of the year will be held on April 1, which marks the Memorial date for 1950. On that day after 6:00 p.m., consecrated people of God, both anointed and their Jonadab companions, along with persons of goodwill, will assemble to commemorate this event. The things there memorialized are now culminating with Messiah’s presence, as the hopes, blessings and promises linked to Christ’s death and resurrection and the new world begin to fulfill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These wonderful things we are privileged to announce during the current </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> campaign, and particularly during the month of April. Our proclamation will be spearheaded with one of the greatest instruments on earth for announcing Messiah’s presence, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> which for sixty years carried the subtitle “And Herald of Christ’s Presence”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Careful planning relative to the various features of Kingdom service, and especially Memorial week-end activity and the public meetings which will follow, will make it possible for all publishers to participate. May that not mean a new peak of publishers announcing Messiah’s presence? Take time to meditate on these things. If the true significance of this wondrous privilege absorbs us we will take advantage of every opportunity to herald it forth as Jehovah’s spirit motivates us to action during the “Announcing Messiah’s Presence” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">as the center of true worship, the publishers will desire to contribute toward its upkeep by personally cooperating in keeping it clean and providing sufficient funds to care for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Center of Kingdom Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Kingdom Hall is maintained for the benefit of all the publishers and persons of good-will. It can readily be appreciated, then, that it is inadvisable for individuals to use it for personal purposes, such as a salesroom or for receptions, parties and things of this nature. It should always be borne in mind that the Kingdom Hall belongs to the entire company. Therefore, no individual or group of individuals can commandeer its use for any specific purpose. The brethren are paying the rent or have ownership of the Kingdom Hall for one purpose: to honor the Lord’s name. Therefore, use it for that purpose exclusively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where the Kingdom Hall is exclusively the property of Jehovah’s witnesses, and hence not shared with someone else, then it should be quite easy to keep the hall neat and clean, and to use it exclusively for the purpose of praising Jehovah’s name. It should be a place of true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A warm spirit of friendliness and consideration should prevail among the brethren in the Kingdom Hall, and these same qualities expressed to the good-will and strangers will make them feel welcome and at home. That means much to one who has been pushed around by this cold world. If all publishers appreciate the purpose the Kingdom Hall plays in the Lord’s arrangement, then all will help to keep it clean and pre-</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">All railroads have guaranteed airconditioned, reclining seat coaches and Pullman equipment. These trains will depart from point of origin in sufficient time to arrive in New York July 29, 1950, so passengers will have daylight hours to locate rooms, etc. In most cases, departure from New York has been scheduled for August 8, so that all will have opportunity to visit the new factory and Bethel home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is suggested that companies with no Society-appointed transportation servant assign some capable brother to oversee transportation arrangements locally and cooperate with the Society by helping the brethren join special train groups. Transportation servants can check with local railroad agents about fares, etc. Any reduced fare arrangements will be announced by the Society if and when they materialize. It is recommended that brethren work through their transportation servant in order to avoid unnecessary difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No air or bus transportation is being arranged by the Society for the United States; those desirous of traveling by such means should make their own arrangements. In making inquiries or contracts for air or bus travel, groups or individuals should </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font1"> use the Watchtower Society’s name, since the arrangement is entirely local and does not involve the Society. Shortly the Society will send a circular to each company outlining complete train schedules for the United States, and other travel information of concern to all travelers coming to New York city. Full instructions on when to begin purchasing rail tickets and how to join special train groups will be given.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Prepares Way for New World Living</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> With a regularity determined by the Creator, time melts away and the final end of this wicked system of things draws ever nearer. Today, far advanced as we are in the “time of the end”, the remaining time is extremely short. Do you believe this to be true? If you do you will be among those who act in harmony with Paul's counsel at Ephesians 5:15,16 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Rei\ Stan. Ver.):</span><span class="font3"> “Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, making the most of the time, because the days are evil.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> During November we will have our first opportunity to place in the field the superlative new instrument </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”,</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of 35c. With zeal and enthusiasm we will commence its initial presentation, because it is especially valuable for aiding men of good will to make wise use of the remaining time. Persons who show Interest but who do not take a book should be given the opportunity to obtain the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Can You Lire Forever in Happiness on Earth? </span><span class="font3">for a 5c contribution, or free if they will read it. Endeavor to place a copy in every home.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pattern Set for New World Living</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> But can we say that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font3"> aids toward the wise use of time? Yes, because it points out in simple and understandable terms what God requires of those who gain life in his new world. As the reader converts from his former ways, gleaning point after point from these refreshing pages, time once wasted in old world living is salvaged and put to profitable use. These righteous principles will prevail on into the new world because they are based upon the Word of God. What information could be more practical?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> There is condensed instruction on how to become a preacher of life. But preaching alone is not sufficient. So preachers as well as new learners profit from chapters on love, proper marital relations, the rearing of children and theocratic headship in the home: sound, practical instruction on daily living.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Other chapters furnish vital information on the Creator, his arrangements for salvation for humankind and for establishing the new world, conditions that will exist there, and how to put up a hard fight for the faith so as to be among those who reap the reward. It is assuredly wise use of your time to conform to these instructions and to get this book into the hands of others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> So into the field we go I Countless thousands of the people we now contact will be looking forward to a visit from us, having heard or read of our recent international convention in New York city. They will be pleased to know that you have a copy of one of the convention releases for them, and so reasonable too I People want to know how to live. They show this by their restless search for something better, for diversion, for health. We have the information they so much want and need.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Organize for Efficient Coverage</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Since all territory is now new, never having been covered with this offer, why not make wise use of the time spent in this initial coverage? Each publisher can work toward that end by keeping a record of every book obtainer, having in mind making back-calls and starting Bible studies. After all, if we are expecting these people to make the necessary change in the pattern of their lives, we must appreciate that they will require much personal assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Efficient coverage presupposes that the territory will be systematically and thoroughly worked. Those who can will obtain a personal territory, taking constant and loving care of those who live there. Others will strive to regularly share in group witnessing. Advance arrangements should include not only the selection of territory to be worked, but also convenient times, both week ends and mid-week for those who can then take part. Arrange, too, for the proper supervision by a captain who can assign each worker sufficient territory to keep him occupied during the witnessing period.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Instruct at Service Meetings</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> At each service meeting appropriate announcements will be made to acquaint everyone with the arrangements for field service. But the service meeting Itself should already have stirred up in the hearts of all attending the desire to share in presenting </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”.</span><span class="font3"> Points from the book may be there discussed to show how to use the contents to best advantage. Call upon the brethren who have placed the book to give their experiences, for this will furnish practical information on how to present it and will stimulate others to share in this wise use of time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“Numerous opportunities for placing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font3"> will be encountered besides in the regular door-to-door work. Carry a copy with you while in street magazine work; present it to business associates, social callers and delivery men, relatives: yes, people, | wherever contacted, will find this I book interesting, enlightening and</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>New Peak Begins</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Jehovah’s Blessing on Faithful Efforts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">111,398 publishers! This is what the final tabulation of the September report shows. Not only did we surpass our previous peak, but we also exceeded our 1951 quota of 108,315 publishers this very first month of the service year. What an excellent start for the 1951 service yearI It promises to be another grand year of theocratic expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Without doubt a major factor accounting for this marvelous peak was the Theocracy's Increase Assembly. As the August </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font3">predicted : “The effects of this great assembly will be felt throughout the earth . . . The information carried back will be a driving force for energetic and enthusiastic service.” And so it has been. This assembly really made the Theocracy live for God’s servants. Catching up the convention spirit, fired with burning zeal and enthusiasm, they returned home with greater determination than ever to “preach the word”. And with what gratifying results!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our present joy and enthusiasm is not just a feeling that will calm</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>New Change of Address Form</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In order to eliminate some of the difficulty experienced by the brethren who wish to notify the office of a change in address, the Society is issuing a new change of address form (S-20) which will replace both the form now used for magazine subscribers (L-201) and the general change of address form for pioneers, circuit servants and company servants (SP-2). Ten copies of this new form for each company are enclosed. Its use can be explained at the service meeting and a sample placed on the information board until the brethren are familiar with it. When you receive the new forms, discard the old change of address forms (SP-2 and L-201) and start using the new one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Please note that squares which appear at the top of the form are to be checked according to the circumstances of the individual who helpful. Undoubtedly service meeting discussions will bring out other likely places where the book may be presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Whatever the circumstances under which you present </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”,</span><span class="font3"> do so with conviction. Having read it yourself, you are convinced of its truthfulness and the importance it holds for all men. Their very lives depend upon these truths! Your enthusiasm and earnestness will the more quickly convince your hearers. As they then pause from the time-consuming activities of the world to hear, read and then act. you will know that you have been making the wisest and most profitable use of the remaining time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">New Service Year!</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">and gradually die out. It is, rather, an intelligent appreciation of Jehovah's kingship and of his mighty organization. It is, in part, the proper expression of our love for Jehovah's undeserved kindness in granting us the privilege of serving as ambassadors for his established kingdom. With joy and gladness we jubilantly sing out Jehovah’s praises. Because of this his spirit has surged through the entire visible organization manifesting itself in another all-time peak. We diligently planted, consistently watered, and Jehovah has given the increase. Yes, this is the day of Theocracy's increase, and blessed are we to be living in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is truly a good beginning. Let us keep on with this same determination. By being regular publishers, aiding others, meeting each obstacle that presents itself during the year, we will not only reach higher peaks but will be adding our part to Theocracy's increase. “So let us not give up in doing what is right, for in due season we shall reap by not giving out.”—Gal. 6 : 9, .Vli’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">moves and hence uses it. If you subscribe to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> check that square: if you also subscribe to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> check that square too. Company servants will check the square before that name. and. if you are a pioneer, check the proper square to show that. In other words, check </span><span class="font2">ALL SQUARES THAT APPLY, blit DO </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">not check any squares that do not apply to you. Company servants in particular should without fail show the company with which they are associated, but it would be well for all others to furnish this information too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This change of address form may also be used to change the address of the person to whom distributors’ magazines are sent. However, if a change in quantity is also desired at the same time, please use the present distributors’ order blank (S-66) as in the past. Additional supplies of the new form should be ordered along with your orders for literature or other supplies.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>A New Home Bible Study for Each Publisher</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Our Goal</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> For His honor and the lasting benefit it brings to mankind, Jehovah has caused preaching to become the most important work in the world. Thousands from all walks of life have taken up this honorable and life-saving work during the past year ami it is to these persons and others who have already been busy advertising the King and the Kingdom that the apostle Paul's words are directed in this day, “Preach the word: keep at it in season and out of season.”—2 Tim. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font3"> : 2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Yes, it is by preaching the word of truth both 'in favorable season and in troublesome season’ that tins gospel of the Kingdom will be preached in all the world for a witness. Whether we are faced with many obstacles or few, the charge to keep extolling the contents of God’s Word earth-wide remains with us, and we gladly accept this cherished privilege.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Opening the Way to Life</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Christ Jesus has graciously provided the necessary approach to our Father, Jehovah. It is our joy to proclaim this to all who desire everlasting life. Throughout November we have been doing this while presenting the new book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”,</span><span class="font3"> and no doubt many who took this book have already sampled the goodness it contains. During December we will continue to present this book in the field on the contribution of 35c and arrange to start home Bible studies with those who obtain it. Our familiarity with it plus the experience gained in presenting it</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Working with a Purpose</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is a God of purpose. His Word of truth acquaints us with this particular trait of his and gives us a record of past accomplishments as well as what he proposes to do In the future with respect to our planet earth. From this record we get some idea of how he does things and how efficiently his organization is equipped for handling the work he sets out to be done. All things are done In order and in his own time and manner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> To his servants on earth he has given a commission to preach this gospel of the Kingdom throughout the inhabited earth before the final end of this system of things. Faith and determination cause us to believe his Word and to follow his command. All of the Lord’s servants do understand that they should preach and zealously engage in all features of the service. But being imperfect we are inclined to not always keep clear in our minds the real reason for our work. Sometimes a lack of purpose in our work becomes apparent and we find ourselves doing work which is not as effective as it could be. If this continues over a period of time we find that our work becomes somewhat arduous and the real burning desire to aid those of good will is cooled to some degree. Hence, the need to keep the truths of Jehovah’s Word firmly fixed in our heart and to always keep the purpose of our work clearly in mind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Keeping the proper frame of mind is very essential for regular, during November should aid us much in this work during December.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> But how can we aid the persons who receive this timely publication to really appreciate the need of absorbing its contents to the full and then acting upon it to their ultimate salvation? Experience has proved that the home Bible study is the answer. Whether young or old, all associated publishers should share in this work of teaching, as the goal of one new home Bible study in the new book per publisher is suggested for the month of December.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> This should not be difficult to accomplish, since the many back-calls on the new book placements will furnish the potential. Converting these into studies will be made easier, too, if we are familiar with the book and can demonstrate its helpful features. Let the obtainer of the book see the real need of digging into the Bible with the aid of this instrument. Read appropriate paragraphs to accentuate and convince him of the vital need for receiving knowledge in this time of the end through a systematic Bible study which will reveal how he can walk upon the road leading to life. Always be alert and watchful to satisfy their need for Bible truth. Undoubtedly, many of these persons will readily accept the opportunity to freely drink of the water of life through the means of a home Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Unswervingly, therefore, we will continue to preach Jehovah's Word of truth to all that will hear. The time is short! Soon the Kingdom will crush Satan’s organization and bring indescribable blessings to earth's inhabitants. Let all who will, learn this through our obediently ‘preaching the word’.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">effective and joyful service. A servant who understands his work and appreciates fully the need of it is one who does his work efficiently. He works regularly in the place assigned. And the blessings received bring joy and contentment, because he knows the work of his hands finds approval with his Master. When opposition is encountered, this is weathered without faltering, because the same determination as possessed by the apostle Paul, to serve faithfully until the end and to do his utmost to “preach the word”, is brought to bear against the force which would destroy his zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Express Love for Sheep</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> One thought should be prominent in the minds of the Lord’s servants as they engage in Jehovah’s service. This is the desire to find anil feed the other sheep. If we keep this thought in mind, we will not be perturbed by any unkind words or acts of those who oppose our work. Our zeal will not be cooled by the fact that so few seem to be interested in hearing of Jehovah’s purposes. We are looking for sheep in fulfillment of our commission, not arguments with uninterested ones. Also, we will not be moved merely by conscience to perform our work, but the burning desire to find the “other sheep” will be the driving force. Our work will be effective because we work with a purpose. Our love for the “other sheep” will be expressive and active. Take the initiative to go and find them and then patiently aid them to a knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>1950 Pioneer Hour</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The pioneer activity is close to the hearts of all the brethren. The pioneers themselves are most keenly interested because it personally affects them. Then, too, the company publishers are concerned about it, for many of them expect to be pioneers in the near future, while to those who cannot be pioneers it is an encouraging example of devotion and service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Just as it is good to periodically examine ourselves in an effort to improve our service, so likewise it is profitable to check on the pioneer activity as a whole. This we have done in the pioneer hour check-up for the 1950 service year. This checkup is encouraging, yet it reveals room for improvement. Sixty-five per cent of the pioneers met or exceeded the minimum hour requirement. Nine per cent came somewhat short of this requirement and were given opportunity during the coming service year to improve, while three per cent, because of their reports and circumstances, were transferred to the company publisher ranks. The remainder are new pioneers put on the list during the last few months of the service year. All but eight of the special pioneers met the minimum hour requirement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> In dealing with the pioneers the Society endeavors to be fair to all, allowing each one full opportunity to measure up to the requirements of the pioneer work. This it does by giving consideration to individual circumstances. Nevertheless, the Society must maintain the established and proper standards for such service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Individual Check-up</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Although this check-up was to find out how the pioneers have done in respect to meeting their hour requirement. the check-up should not end there for the pioneer. He should be concerned with improving in every respect as a full-time publisher. Ask yourself: Is my presentation at the door effective? Am I following up the interest that I find, by making back-calls and conducting studies? Do I engage in the magazine work, putting to good use the magazines the Society sends me?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> In Bible study these persons gain the knowledge which furnishes the foundation for understanding. Here working with a purpose is very essential too, since one must be ever alert to instruct as the sheep advance to maturity and take their places in the chorus of praise singers. Sometimes being alert to do the little things to aid does much to impress and build up those with whom you are studying. For example, when points come up that seem hard to understand, a little extra research on these points to bear out the correct understanding and meaning will be appreciated. This demonstrates that we are sincere and that the knowledge we have gained by regular study at the Kingdom Hall and privately has not been gained to hoard up but to share unselfishly with others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> As we preach, let us do it with a purpose. The Word needs to be preached more and more, and the sheep need to be fed. If we keep this commission clearly in mind and continually work to become more adept in carrying it out in harmony with Jehovah's organization, we will be working with a purpose.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Check-up Completed</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Do I co-operate with the company by supporting its service arrangements, and otherwise set a good example for all? Upon finding shortcomings, work to overcome them. Always seek to improve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> To lie a pioneer and successfully meet the requirements year after year calls for effort, study, and planning. Especially is this true since the provisions for suspension have been replaced by the decided reduction in the yearly hour requirement. Just as any business poorly managed will fail, so will the activity of a pioneer gradually slacken if pursued without purpose or plan. Schedule your time wisely, allowing for field service, study and meetings, meals, secular work, etc. Then carry out this schedule with determination. This, coupled with firm reliance on Jehovah for guidance and strength to overcome difficulties, should enable you to finish each service year fully meeting the hour requirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> In view of the foregoing, how well have you done? You will not want to make comparisons primarily with others, but it is encouraging to know that there are others in every part of the country, under similar circumstances, who are meeting the full-time requirements. This proves that it can lie done I When making comparison use the greatest pioneer as your example, namely Christ Jesus. He worked with a purpose, being joyful and zealous for Jehovah's service. So today, let publishers and pioneers alike be of the same mind, joyfully using their time in the witness work. Besides, more time in Jehovah’s service leaves less time for the ensnaring things of this world. Hence, the safe choice is to spend more time in His service. If you can spend full time in this work and are not already a pioneer, then take steps to become one. Write for an application blank. Along with the pioneers, we highly commend this service to you and we </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">will be glad to work</span><span class="font3"> with you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The 1950 bound volumes of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> will soon be prepared. There will still be a limited supply left after all the orders on hand have been filled. Hence, any desiring either of these 1950 volumes should send their order in immediately and they will be filled as long as the supply lasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In that it is necessary from the beginning of the year to set aside the required number from each issue as they are printed, it is requested that all orders for the 1951 volumes be placed immediately, so that you will be sure of receiving your volume at the end of the year. When ordering be sure to specify the year and magazine desired. A remittance of $2.00 for each volume should accompany the order.</span></p>

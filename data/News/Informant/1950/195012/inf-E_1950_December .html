<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul was nearing the end of his long, faithful ministry. His trials had been many and some very difficult, but in bonds of imprisonment he counseled the young man Timothy, impressing upon his mind the most important work for him as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Was that to seek financial security? Gain worldly prestige? Or climb the social ladder of success? No! Paul’s inspired words pointed to the highest vocation and the most important thing for one desiring everlasting life. He instructed, “Preach the word I”—2 Tim. 4: 2,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Timothy did preach, but Paul’s words pointed forward especially to our day when the life of every living creature depends upon the choice of the right way based on God’s Word. Urgent it is for us to “preach the word”. And this we have been doing. Reflect: As we look back over the past year’s activity, we see Jehovah’s rich blessing upon the word preached. Increase after increase has resulted, circuit assemblies have accentuated our joy, and the climax was reached at the wonderful assembly in New York city. At the public meeting 123,707 in attendance attested to Jehovah’s blessing upon the word preached. The world may call this preaching impractical if it wishes, but the results show the opposite. Gratefully we go forth in December, the last month under this yeartext.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Effective Preaching</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> December brings us to the second month of presenting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 35c, and endeavoring to leave a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth!</span><span class="font2"> in every home. Present the book enthusiastically and with conviction. Work for efficient presentation. Chapter 2, for example, presents excellent talking points. This age of science and advance in human wisdom tends to exalt man. He can peer millions of light-years into space, probe the secrets of atomic energy and erect great buildings. His theories lead him still farther until the layman looks to man and his greatness and becomes subject to such leaders to do their will. Great men, however, when seen from God’s viewpoint are very little. They have made advances, yes, yet the Lord says man is as a grasshopper, the nations as dust in the balance! God alone is great and he is the Giver of life. Should we not humble ourselves and learn of his requirements for life?.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> What kind of life has God promised those who will meet his requirements? Chapter 27 points out that it is God’s purpose to restore to this earth the paradise of Eden with all its blessings. That means everlasting life with peace, freedom and happiness. What a prospect for righteous, God-fearing persons today ! To learn of this righteous new world is of greatest importance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Many other presentations may be used, but, in all cases, “preach the word” as commanded and then offer the book as an aid to study. The holiday season brings added opportunities for presentation. Since it has been impossible to fill all domestic and foreign orders, companies that do not have supplies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life” </span><span class="font2">may use </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Preach the Word” by Following Through</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> The brief witness and placing of the book is only the start. Hearing and learning are required, as John 6:45 points out. That means back-calls. Perhaps you make the back-call and they say they haven’t read the book. What then? Words to this effect might be used to strike their interest: ‘I realize that many things come up that prevent us from doing all we would like to do. However. you will agree that if you don’t read the book it will be of little benefit to you. I desire to aid you to learn the precious contents of the book you have. It has brought much comfort and understanding to me and I’m sure it will bring this to you also. The chapter on the Author of Life is very interesting . . .’ etc. Or if they seem indifferent about the book, you might ask if they have any Bible questions they would like answered. If not, you ask one; “Do you believe there will be people that will live on the earth forever in peace and happiness?” You might go to chapter 27 for your discussion. In this way you start them talking and the way is opened for you to preach the Word. Be friendly. Talk to the people as your neighbors, which they are.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Start Studies in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> If the people of good will want life they must take in knowledge of Jehovah and Christ Jesus. (John 17:3, AB’) So, study is essential. Go into a discussion on some subject in the book on your back-call and then show where you got your information. They too can get such information by studying the book and you will be glad to come to their home and discuss the book subject by subject with them. This is what they need to understand the Bible and God's requirements for life. The idea that one must go to college, or a theological seminary, or learn Greek and Hebrew before he can understand the Bible is wrong. The Bible was written for the common man, and everyone can understand it through informal study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Remember, our goal is one study per publisher. Have you started yours? By this means the Word will be preached even more widely in the days to come. To aid in this</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">All servants of Jehovah will be strengthened and encouraged by the president’s report on the world-wide activity of Jehovah’s witnesses which appears in the 1951 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses.</span><span class="font2"> Continued expansion, faithfulness under persecution, Increased knowledge and appreciation, thrilling experiences, all these unite to make the 1951 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font2"> a documentary record of Christian activity which clearly shows that God’s hand is directing his people. Everyone interested in the expansion of pure worship should have this report for frequent reference and study. In addition, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font2">contains the president’s comment on the yeartext for 1951, and a Bible text with comments for each day of the coming year. Copies are available for 50e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The 1951 Calendar is also available now. It depicts a full side view of the Society’s factory, including the new addition, above which is the new yeartext. On the pad in pastel shades are varied views of interest to Jehovah’s witnesses, and also the testimony period designations and themes for Intervening months. Calendars are 25c each, or 5 for $1.00 when sent to one address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When ordering, please keep in mind that all who are associated with a company should order through the company, remitting in advance. The company should use the regular order blank and remittance forms when ordering these cash items. Please endeavor to anticipate the company’s needs so that all its requirements are filled with only one </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font2"> and Calendar order.</span></p>

The change of address for your seven copies is cared for when you check opposite “Pioneer”, “Special Pioneer” or “Circuit Servant”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">respect the servants should plan and execute effective demonstrations to emphasize the importance of this follow-up and study work. Company book study conductors can organize to systematically aid others to share in this work by personally accompanying them and arranging a study for them. Announcements at the close of the book study can stress this important work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> So let December find all consecrated servants of Jehovah God in the field working to be more effective ministers. We will be conscious of the importance of following up our placements and working to start studies with those seeking everlasting life. If we do this, we can be assured of God’s blessings upon our preaching as we continue on ih this way that leads to life.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>New Circuit and District Servant Talks</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">A new public talk “They Shall Not Labor in Vain” will be delivered by circuit servants commencing the first week of January, 1951. Therefore, if the circuit servant is visiting your company after January 1, 1951, use the new public talk title when ordering handbills. Handbill orders that have already been submitted covering the visit of circuit servants after the first of the year will be changed in the office, so you need not request such a change. If other advertising material is on order companies should make their own changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The district servant’s public talk is also being changed the first of the year. All circuit assemblies commencing with the week end of January 4-6, 1951, will be served with the new talk, “Surviving This World’s End.” Advertising material should be ordered accordingly.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Obtaining Pioneer Literature</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers, are you obtaining literature through the company? Recent increases in the number of orders from pioneers, some of whom are even stock or company servants, indicate that many have overlooked the advantages of so doing Even special items may be ordered for pioneers by the company, making it unnecessary for most pioneers to open an account.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> During the last days of this old system of things, Jehovah has decreed that a final witness be given. The big question then before all mankind is, Who will share in it? The obvious answer resounds, His people! The ones he has given a clear picture of this present system’s impending destruction, shown the way of escape and commissioned to proclaim ’this good news of the kingdom for a witness to all nations before the accomplished end’. (Matt. 24:14, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font2"> Before that accomplished end, a yet unnumbered multitude of “other sheep” will gladly hear the good news of the kingdom and share in the final witness. Jehovah’s present-day witnesses are happy to aid the “other sheep&quot; not yet gathered begin a life of praise to him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Because of the importance of this final witness and the mammoth part </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> plays in it, the Society has scheduled the 13th annual </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign from the first of January through April. Four grand months to offer from door to door, on back-calls, Bible studies, street witnessing, yes, wherever and whenever the opportunity presents itself, a year’s subscription to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> for a $1 contribution, with a premium of 3 booklets. The premium should include </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution versus The New World, Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth?</span><span class="font2"> and any other self-covered booklet. A remittance of 90c should accompany each such subscription. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake !</span><span class="font2"> may be offered to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscribers but without a premium.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> The quota for this campaign has been set at 2 subscriptions for each company publisher and 16 for each</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Reminders on Ordering Handbills</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> It is a pleasure to notice the fine upsurge in the public meeting activity following the New York assembly. Companies large and small are pushing this feature of the service and are ordering handbills from the Society to effectively advertise them. Since apparently some facts relative to ordering handbills have been forgotten or overlooked, a few reminders are here called to attention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> First of all, keep in mind that, although It is permissible to use other subjects for talks, handbills are provided by the Society only for the eight talks of the current series, and for the circuit and district servants’ talks.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Another important item is the need of ordering on time. Arrange your series as far in advance as possible and try to order for the entire series at once rather than for one or two talks at intervals. A month from the time you order until the handbills are needed is necessary, and five or six weeks is preferred when companies are west of the Mississippi.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> The handbill order blank should be filled out carefully and accurately, with a typewriter if available, or otherwise neatly printed. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Be sure to give all the required information. </span><span class="font2">As many as five talks can be ordered on one of the blanks, provided there is no change in hall address or quantity. (The old-style handbill order blank with which only one talk could be ordered on each blank should be discarded and not used.) If, for some reason, you want more handbills for one of the talks than the others, list it on a separate or-pioneer. All indications point to this 13th annual </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign to be the biggest yet, for not only are thousands more sharing in the final witness, but the many new appealing features of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">will play an important part in obtaining many more new subscriptions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Preparation Necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> The company servant should check immediately with the various servants to ascertain campaign needs and then order accordingly. Be sure plenty of subscription blanks (L-l) and Subscription Record sheets (S-10) are on hand. Ten to fifteen minutes could be profitably spent on a service meeting considering the Society’s letter (S-90) of July 1, 1950, on How to Properly Handle Subscriptions. It would be well to post this letter on the company information board for reference during the campaign. Companies that do not have this letter will be sent one upon request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Advertising servants should increase the company’s magazine order according to approximate needs. Territory servants will select areas not worked during the last </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign to be covered first and arrange systematic coverage of the company’s entire territory, while the accounts servant will organize his department so that subscriptions will be handled quickly and sent in each week to aid in giving the subscribers good service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> But individual preparation is also necessary. Let each publisher acquaint himself with the new features of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> prepare himself to give an effective witness and arrange to take advantage of every in season and out of season’ opportunity to share in the final witness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">der blank showing the quantity desired and also all other necessary information. The same applies if you want one of the talks at a different address.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Sometimes the Society discovers that the date specified does not fall on the day of the week given. This and all other errors can be avoided if the blanks are carefully filled out, checked and signed by the company servant, and verified and signed by the assistant company servant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Be sure to order in lots of even thousands for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">each</span><span class="font2"> talk. Do not order less than 1,000 or uneven quantities, such as 1,200, 2,500, etc., because handbills are only printed in lots of 1,000. Where fewer are required, blank handbills may be ordered in any quantity. These are always in stock and can be supplied immediately. The name of the speaker, time and other local information will have to be very carefully stamped or printed in by the company, making certain that the imprint is straight and neat. When ordering blank handbills a regular handbill order blank should be used. Be sure to give all necessary information, and also state when the handbills will be needed so that they can be sent to you in sufficient time. All handbills are 25c per thousand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Handbills for foreign-language talks are treated the same as those for English talks. A translation of only the front of the handbills wanted should be attached to the order and the language noted in the upper right-hand corner of the order blank.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> When you mail the order write HANDBILL ORDER on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">outside</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>To Feature “Pure Language” of the</span></h4>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>New World Translation</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> With what joy we received the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> at Yankee Stadium last summer! How we thrilled to learn of a new translation whose sole purpose “is to exalt the name of the living, true God and spread the fragrant knowledge of his kingdom by Christ Jesus”! A version which would commend itself to every honest searcher for the truth of the divine revelation because of its faithfulness, courage and correctness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Four months have gone by since we received this new translation. How far have we progressed in our reading and study of it? Have we carefully considered the wealth of information appearing in the Foreword and the Appendix so as to fully appreciate the arguments there presented? To what extent are we becoming familiar with the word chains and the theocratic marginal references? Yes, what progress are we making toward mastering the “pure language” contained in this latest and choicest provision of Jehovah through his “faithful and discreet slave”? That all may thus become fully familiar with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font2"> it will be the sole textbook in our theocratic ministry schools for the next two years.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Outline of Study</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Beginning with the week of December 24, 1950, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font2"> will be the basis of our instruction talks, student talks, and audience participation as well as the “homework” of our ministry school.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup> Instruction talks:</span><span class="font2"> The first instruction talk will give a general summary of the translation as a whole. The next five instruction talks will be based on the Foreword, to be followed by eighteen talks based on the Appendix. Thereafter instruction talks will discuss the more significant word chains.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Student talks and audience participation:</span><span class="font2"> The first and second student talks will be based on the translation Itself, each talk covering about three and a half pages. Rather than merely repeat the account or the arguments presented, the purpose of these talks will be to highlight the fine points of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font2"> After the school servant has given his counsel, the audience will be given one minute to comment on points that may have been overlooked. The third student speaker will use a subject taken from the word chains. Instruction talks will be fifteen minutes long, student talks more than six but less than eight minutes. There will be no oral or written reviews.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> In companies where a third speaker is not scheduled the school servant will have the company look up the chain references and comment on them, using not more than ten minutes to do so. Where also no second speaker is scheduled (as in of the envelope in the lower lefthand corner to insure its getting prompt attention.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> Careful attention to these seemingly minor points by every company throughout the country results in a tremendous saving of time at the factory. Are you keeping pace with public meeting activity? Why not plan for a series now, order your handbills in advance and keep the above suggestions in mind when so doing? very small companies) the first speaker will cover both the first and second assignments, speaking from 8 to 10 minutes. In this way all the companies will benefit from the complete course regardless of how many student speakers they may have scheduled.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> This new schedule will require diligent study on the part of the school servant and those giving the talks if the brethren listening are to be properly instructed. Especially the instruction talks based on the Foreword and the Appendix will require digging for additional material and careful planning of the outline. And by each one going over the material to be discussed before coming to the meeting he will not only be able to follow the talks more readily but will also be equipped to give helpful comments at the opportune time. (For further details see instructions appearing on the back of the Theocratic Ministry Speaking Schedule, which instructions are also to be carefully studied at a service meeting some time before the new talks begin.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Benefits to Be Derived</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> The study of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font2"> in the theocratic ministry school will truly be a joy and a delight. It will give us a better understanding and increased appreciation of the Christian Greek Scriptures. It will help us in our efforts to perfect our mastery of the “pure language”; to use “consummation of the systems of things” instead of “end of the world”, “undeserved kindness” instead of “grace”, “congregation” Instead of “church”, “mild-tempered” Instead of “meek”, “impaled” instead of “crucified”, “torture stake” instead of “cross”, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> Above all else, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font2"> Is accurate; and we will appreciate that more and more as we continue our study. Never does it sacrifice the truth for the sake of euphony, rhetoric or poetic diction, or to promulgate the teachings of any sect. It restores the name of Jehovah to its proper place In the Christian Greek Scriptures. It gives a literal translation to the extent that the modern English idiom permits and “where a literal translation does not for any clumsiness hide the thought”. By careful individual study and regular attendance at the theocratic ministry school, we will be fully convinced of these things and will be able to intelligently and confidently put to silence all criticism leveled at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font2"> because of its radical departures from generally accepted versions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> Many indeed are the blessings that will be ours as we peruse and study the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation. </span><span class="font2">Let us take full advantage of our opportunity to do so in the theocratic ministry school.</span></p></li></ul>

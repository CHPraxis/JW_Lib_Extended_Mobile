<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Offer for the Month: Three Bound Books</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">True to his promise, Jehovah has provided the Seed to crush Satan the Devil. This Seed, the Messiah, has already received the command from Jehovah to rule in the midst of his enemies and has cast the wicked spirit foes down from the heavens. The year 1914 marked the time of this setback in Satan’s ambitious pursuit of power, and since this time Jehovah’s witnesses have zealously heralded his falling and ultimate death with Jehovah’s song of taunt. “You shall raise this taunt-song against the King of Babylon, crying: How the tyrant is hushed.”—Isaiah 14: 4, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One purpose in making this taunt-song audible world-wide is to help persons in slavery to this wicked tyrant realize the futility of continued service to him and his organization, then to “come out of her, my people”, and join in the singing of the taunt-song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To aid these people, we shall add all the volume we can to the song during May. The three books </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;, “The Kingdom Is at Hand”</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”,</span><span class="font2"> or any other three books which you may have in stock, will be offered for a $1.00 contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Sing the Song Regularly and Effectively</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These publications contain the necessary information, for one to learn the truth. This can be testified to by the many who have studied them and know their effectiveness in a study of the Bible. But how shall we show the people we meet in the field that the books we present are essential to them? How shall we demonstrate that they are books really different from the millions turned out by the different publishing houses of the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of the many, note the following thoughts. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> contains: The Bible’s account of creation, the count of time, how the Bible was produced, “seven times” explained, glimpses of the new earth under the thousand-year reign. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”:</span><span class="font2"> Christ proved to be the Messiah-King by lineage and actual account of ministry, full history of the typical kingdom and the Kingdom’s establishment in reality, ample evidence that Christ’s reign began in 1914. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” •' </span><span class="font2">Consideration of major doctrinal points, how God views present efforts of Jews in Palestine, and how one can really practice true worship. Equally interesting points can be found in the other books which you may include in the offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Surely each one of the Lord’s servants can present the offer effectively by reviewing these and the</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">April 17, 1950 Dear fellow Publishers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is with deep gratitude to Jehovah that we express ourselves concerning his goodness. All of you publishers in the field have done marvelously in aiding people of good-will to learn the truth. Not only that, you have helped them to preach the Word. The “other sheep” are joining us in showing their appreciation to God for learning the way of eternal life. We rejoice with them. They are making expression of their thankfulness In their reports from Africa, Asia, South America, Europe, and everywhere by preaching the Word. You have planted and watered. Now Jehovah gives the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the ends of the earth reports for March are coming in to my office telling of new peaks in publishers. In the United States alone we had 100,717 publishers in March. What a privilege it will be for these to greet many of their fellow publishers from different parts of the world at the 1950 assembly!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The preachers of the Word in New York city itself feel their responsibility greatly and are trying to help every interested person to have a share in announcing the King and Kingdom. The 26 units of the New York Company of Jehovah’s witnesses had a peak of 3,366 in March. Beginning with the first day of April, all the publishers tried to help one another to get out in the field during April; and I learned this morning that the 26 units in New York city had 3,904 publishers preaching in the first 16 days of the month. It is marvelous in our eyes how the Lord is raising up more willing hearts and minds to aid in convention work and how the New York publishers are also reaping the results of their planting work of previous weeks and months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If this New York report is any indication of what is happening throughout the earth, all of us will be eager to know what the final report for the world will be in April. Celebrating the Lord’s death on April 1 got us off to a good start in the United States: 144,215 persons attended, to compare with last year’s 129,025.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What a joy to be in a unit, a company, a country, this earth, singing the praises of the Most High in these days and sharing in the great expansion that is going on now by Jehovah’s grace world-wide. Of all people, we are glad to be alive, and we are grateful that Jehovah has allowed us to remain and has held oft the day of final destruction of this old world so we can preach to more people. We will, by God’s grace, increase our joy and continue to preach the Word with patience as long as Jehovah wants that work done, standing shoulder to shoulder in his Theocratic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With much love and best wishes to all of you, I am,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brother and servant,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">many other points, both individually and by observing closely the demonstrations at the service meeting. Here the company, through its servants, should make sure well-planned demonstrations are scheduled early in the month and throughout the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Rural Work with Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May brings warmer weather and the opportunity to expand our singing activity into the rurals. By a systematic arrangement all of the rural territory of the company can be covered thoroughly with the Kingdom message. Just consider the ways this can be done. A particular area, preferably that surrounding a small village or rural community in the territory, can be selected, and a group of publishers assigned to concentrate on this by a house-to-house coverage, presenting the offer and advertising the public talk. This can be given in the local community hall, schoolhouse or even outside in a park, on a lawn or other accessible ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Remember, too, that where it is inadvisable to hold a complete series of talks you may arrange for two or even one, depending on the circumstances or the available halls, etc. Conduct a campaign in one area with the public meetings while the territory is being covered, and then move on to another one. Interested persons found should be revisited and fed regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Servants should plan now for an organized coverage of the rurals during the spring and summer months. In larger companies two or more groups can be arranged for rural campaigns. When going into the rurals the groups should arrange to spend </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> full day in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With so many ways of swelling the taunt-song against Satan in May, certainly none of Jehovah’s servants will neglect to add their voices to the chorus of singers. Satan has about had his day; he is reaching the summit of his ambitious climb to rival the Most High, and this enslaving tyrant is doomed to certain destruction in this generation. With this truth ringing out world-wide, many, many persons now in slavery to Satan will begin now to serve Jehovah, before Satan’s destruction along with all who refuse to take up the tauntsong.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Trailer Camp Unlikely</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">All of the Lord’s servants are now keenly looking forward to the International convention scheduled for July 30 to August 6, 1950. Since you have made up your mind to attend the assembly, one of the questions of prime interest to you is, “Where am I going to stay while in New York?” Now is the time to attend to this matter, and to assist you the Society is mailing, with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> the Room Request Forms which you have been waiting for. Additional copies may be had by company servants upon request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Instructions have been prepared by the Society to help you provide all the pertinent information required by the Convention Committee </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font2"> facilitate assignment. Therefore, study thoroughly the instructions attached to the forms at your next service meeting. It will be much better to fill out the form carefully and completely than to write letters endeavoring to describe accommodations you wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It would be well to mail the Room Request Forms as soon as possible to Watchtoweb Convention, 557 West 157th St., New York 32, N. Y. This will advise the committee of the number of rooms necessary. Be sure to designate whether you want accommodations in private homes or in hotels. This time there is a good supply of hotel rooms and they will be assigned as long as they last. None are within walking distance of the convention grounds, so subways must be used. The hotel rooms will be a little higher priced than in other cities. Bear in mind, too, that there is no overnight parking permitted on streets in most hotel areas, and it will cost an additional $1.50 to $2.00 a night to put your car in a hotel garage or in a parking lot</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Up to this time we have not found a suitable place for a trailer camp, and It is doubtful that one can be located within twenty-five miles of New York city. If any location is found you will be notified later, but do not plan on a trailer camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Accept Rooms Assigned</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even though thousands of hours will be required to obtain the necessary additional rooms in private homes, the publishers of the New York area are happy to do this on behalf of their visiting brethren. When such rooms are assigned they should be accepted. Do not ask for a room in a private home “just to be safe”, with the intention of looking for something better when you arrive. The majority of the brethren do accept the rooms assigned and experience many blessings in witnessing to the people of good-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Information on Convention Travel</span></h3>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Three-Bound-Book Offer to Continue</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">“Ye are my witnesses, saitli Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen.” (Isa. 43:10, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font2"> What a wealth of meaning lies in those few words'. Thereby the world is made to know that the Creator of the universe has chosen servants from among men and has honored them by placing his name upon them. As a result, great responsibility rests upon these servants. It means that their actions must at all times reflect the dignity and purity of the name they bear, and it means that they must be witnesses of Jehovah and his purposes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in -fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During June those favored with the name of Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to present three bound books on a contribution of $1. Having presented the same offer during May, all should now be organized for especially efficient action. If results fell below expectations during May it would be well to try to determine why, and then seek to improve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For example, one might ask himself, “Am I engaging in essential door-to-door work to the extent that I should to make placements and to contact people of good-will? Can my presentation be improved? Have I really tried to put into practice new suggestions brought out in service meetings, or am I clinging </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 4) </span><span class="font2">will with whom they stay. But if one falls to show up for his room, that particular householder considers all of Jehovah’s witnesses inconsiderate and irresponsible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Landladies frequently go to considerable trouble to furnish us with rooms: postpone or shorten their own vacations, move members of the family to other rooms, spend money cleaning and painting. Furthermore, they are notified by the Convention Committee of the time you will arrive. They expect you then, and some even sit up late at night so as to welcome the witnesses assigned to stay with them. Hence, if something comes up to change the time you will arrive or to make it impossible for you to come, it is only fair to notify your landlady, even as you would a relative or a friend you were going to visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Itemember, it is primarily in the homes where a witness will be given. Take advantage of this opportunity and see what can be accomplished. Obtain a favorable reaction as the result of proper conduct and conversation and by going to the rooms assigned you. If you want to look for your own rooms when you get to New York you may do so, but if you ask the Convention Committee to get you a room please take it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Considerable work will be required in getting rooms and preparing for the convention; however, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the Societg requests that only those brethren who receive official notice to proceed to New York ahead of time do so.</span><span class="font2"> Others, of course, will remain in their respective assignments until the time of the convention, caring for the good-will interest and preparing to attend the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Most of the work will be required a day or two ahead of the convention and during the convention itself. In order to know who will be to the same old way which has not proved very effective?” To live up to the name requires alertness and progressiveness. Make June a month of progress in your personal ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls Play Important Role</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah is the great Shepherd, and those that live up to the name as his witnesses must see that the “sheep” are fed. So organize the back-call work during June, with each discharging his personal responsibility of calling back on those who took literature in May, and with companies distributing the expired subscription slips sent out by the Society, so that they may be called on promptly. Undoubtedly many of these former subscribers will be glad to have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower or Awake!</span><span class="font2"> come to them regularly, but have neglected to take care of the matter themselves, or they may require assistance to realize the full value of the magazines. Back-calls are important, and those who accept the name should not fail to follow up their door-to-door ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is nothing haphazard about Jehovah and his manner of accomplishing things. He furnishes us now with instructions so that we may also work in an organized manner. Let us, then, carefully plan our service for June, so that we may perform our work harmoniously and in a manner befitting his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">willing to share in this Theocratic service, Volunteer Service forms have also been included with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> Please fill these out </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">completely,</span><span class="font2"> denoting the type of work in which you are apt or with which you have had previous experience. Turn these slips in to the company servant, who in turn should check them over and then mail them to the Watchtower Convention Committee, 557 West 157th St., New York 32, N. Y. There will be a volunteer service booth at the convention for others who wish to apply then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since indications are that all available rooms in New York will be filled by those who come to the convention, your best prospects of obtaining accommodations are through the Convention Committee. It is urged, therefore, that you write </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">early</span><span class="font2"> for your rooming accommodations, and at the same time let the Convention Committee know what type of work you prefer to do while at the convention by volunteering NOW.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Pioneer Letter</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">With this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> the Society is sending a letter relative to the pioneer privileges. These should be distributed along with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> so that each publisher will have a copy for personal study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Owing to tlie importance of the matter of pioneering, the Society suggests that time be set aside on a service meeting early in May to give further consideration to the contents of this letter, either by question and answer or discussion by one or more competent brethren.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Transportation Circular Provided</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">For many months the Society’s Convention Transportation Desk has been gathering information and making arrangements for brethren to travel to the 1950 international convention. New world servants world-wide will assemble in New York city July 30-August 6 to enjoy the “feast of fat things” Jehovah has prepared for his servants in these last days, to strengthen and encourage them for the battle yet ahead. Less than three short months from now the convention starts I Have you arranged for your transportation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To aid you in your travel arrangements the Society is sending with the May </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> a transportation circular, which contains valuable travel information. One copy of the circular should be put on the company information board and one copy given to each family of publishers. Companies who have extra copies may give them to people of good-will planning to attend the convention. If your company does not have extra copies and you know of individuals planning to attend the convention, be sure to discuss the information contained in the circular with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The information contained in the circular should be considered individually and in group study. At the first or second service meeting in May time should be allowed for consideration of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font2"> written material and the special train information relative to the local company. The circular will be considered again at the first service meeting in July, so the brethren will have a clear picture of travel before leaving for the convention. Local transportation servants should be thoroughly familiar with all information contained in the circular and local arrangements, so that maximum assistance can be rendered to the brethren. Where no transportation servant has been appointed, the company committee should designate someone for this service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Arrange for an Early Arrival</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society encourages all who possibly can, whether traveling by auto, bus, regular train, airplane, or other means, to arrive in New York city the morning of July 29. This will afford an opportunity to find rooms during daylight hours, to get acquainted with surroundings and to have a full night’s rest in order to be ready to receive full benefit from the 8-day feast. The Bethel home and factory will be closed during the convention, but both will be open for brethren to visit from Monday, August 7, on. Brethren desiring to see these places can arrange for departure on Tuesday, August 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Purchasing Special Train Tickets</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After making a careful study of the circular and selecting the special train serving your area, those desiring to ride special trains may purchase railroad tickets. Be sure to have your ticket routed over the railroad(s) to be used by the special train en route to and from New York. Local transportation servants will assist you in this and check ticket routing carefully before send-</span></p>

State clearly whether roundtrip or one-way reservations are desired. If one way, state whether it is for the going or return trip. In the event you must change your arrangements after receiving an assignment card, return your card to the local transportation servant. He will send it to the point of origin for cancellation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tickets must be purchased and special train assignment cards requested by July 10. When purchasing your ticket do not neglect having your ticket pre-dated, as outlined in paragraph 14 of the transportation circular. Purchase your ticket and request your seat assignment at the earliest possible date, so that the transportation servant at the point of origin will know how much equipment to order for the train. Orders must be placed early, as rail travel is very heavy during summer months. The railroads involved state this will be one of the largest, if not the largest, single rail transportation move ever. Full cooperation of all brethren and transportation servants is needed to assure coordinated moves. If you are going to travel by regular train, make your reservations at an early date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Most of the special train stops are listed in the circular, but no departure time is given other than for the point of special train origin. When you request your assignment card, the transportation servant at the point of origin will inform you what time the special train departs from the point you want to join it, and will give you any other information he has relative to the move.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you are in doubt relative to your travel after carefully considering the circular, do not fail to contact your local transportation servant. Questions he is unable to answer will be forwarded to Watchtower Convention Transportation at the address shown for your special train, or to the Society’s Convention Transportation Desk in Brooklyn.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Individual Quota Set</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> The vast majority of earth’s people today either slumber under the stupefying sedative of religious, political and commercial propaganda, or blindly grope amid a woe-bedarkened world, insensible to imminent world destruction. They refuse to believe the words of Jehovah’s prophet that ‘it is nearer than they think’. (Isa. 13:6, Young) In contrast with these, however, thousands of honest-hearted, God-fearing people have awakened to the realization that Jehovah's wrath is certain to shortly be expressed against this old, Satanic world. Believing it, they rejoice, for this world’s destruction is in itself a promise of a new world’s construction through Jehovah’s Theocratic kingdom. Knowing that many thousands more must awake to this fact, the question presents itself, How can we help them and arouse their hopes in God’s new world?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The answer is: Acquaint them with God’s Word of truth! They must learn the facts about this evil world, know the truth concerning religion, politics and commerce, understand world happenings in the light of Bible prophecy. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font2">magazine is one of the chief exponents of truth and effectively meets the demand for reliable information. Recognizing this, we will therefore present a one-year subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> for a $1.00 contribution during the month of October. No premium will be offered.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Demonstrations Aid In Meeting Quotas</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> An individual quota of one subscription per publisher and four subscriptions for each pioneer has been set. The company quota will be equivalent to the quota of publishers for the 1951 service year. Each one will work diligently, striving to meet and surpass his individual quota and make this the best </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> campaign to date.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> To aid all publishers in effectively presenting the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> magazine at the doors, practical demonstrations should be arranged for the service meeting program. Bring out the fine talking points on this outstanding magazine and illustrate how they can be used in obtaining subscriptions. This should be done throughout the month so that the publishers can remain </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> conscious. Experiences and discussions can also be featured to show how subscriptions were obtained, how objections were overcome and how the campaign has progressed locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Awake!&quot; Is of Interest to All</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> Awake!</span><span class="font2"> is unique. Each issue contains interesting and valuable information for all. It appeals to everyone: businessman, youth, aged, nature-lover, Bible student and members of the family in general. By becoming familiar with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> you will be prepared to meet on common ground all whom you contact and to show them the merits of subscribing for such a magazine. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font2"> is truly different and stands in contrast to worldly periodicals, newspapers and magazines. It is uncensored and without commercial advertising. It is factual and truthful. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> fearlessly points out the fallacies of religion, the corruption of politics, the enslaving greed of commerce as well as other existent evils. However, it does not merely uncover error, but by adhering to truth and righteous principles it arouses men’s hope for better things and establishes a keen desire for Jehovah’s new world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> To make an effective presentation of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font2"> magazine, however, you must be convinced that it is what the people really need. Would you be without the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font2">magazine? Certainly not! And it is as Important to all lovers of truth and righteousness as it is to you. Impressed by your conviction and sincerity, good-will persons will more readily believe that what you have to offer is vital. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Atcake!</span><span class="font2"> will build up in thefn further confidence in God’s visible organization, the channel that provides the information in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font2"> and will, in many instances, open the way for a subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> later on. Therefore, use </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font2"> in all features of Kingdom activity, at the doors, on back-calls, in the store-to-store and house-to-house magazine work, and on the streets. At all times stress the full year’s subscription before dropping to an offer for six months, on a 50c contribution.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow Up Your Subscriptions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Whenever a subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aicake!</span><span class="font2"> is obtained, be sure to call back. Not only are you interested in getting the magazines into the hands of the people but you want them to come to a full knowledge of the truth. Do not let the spark you have kindled die. By returning with the latest issue a few weeks after placing the subscription you will have the opportunity to further kindle that spark until by persistent and consistent effort it too will become a flaming firebrand reflecting God’s truth. Display genuine love, proper courtesy, dignity and Theocratic tact when helping these &quot;sheep”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> An additional effort should also be made to call on all those whose </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions have expired. These expiration slips are periodically mailed to the company and should not be overlooked. A goodly</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>The Need Is Great Our Goal Is 10 Percent</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> To minister for Jehovah’s ever-increasing Theocracy is a very blessed privilege, a “treasure in earthen vessels”. (2 Cor. 4:7) The more service one performs, the more precious his treasure. Certainly, then, a pioneer devoting full time to the ministry has wonderful possibilities for possessing a treasure of great value. Especially now, in view of world conditions and the uncertainties of life in general, can we appreciate what a privilege and safeguard it is to be a pioneer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The majority of mankind, by sweat, blood and tears, strive to exist, but with what reward? Increased woes and eventual death. Their sense of value is warped. They cling to a sinful, dying old world with its material riches, unaware that the most valuable treasure is to minister the truth of Jehovah’s new world. The latter leads to life. Placing the proper value on this treasure of service, all publishers will keenly strive to increase and expand their privileges of service by becoming full-time pioneers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Why not be a pioneer? How good it would be for you! Having the truth on your mind and speaking it from morning to night, day after day, all the time; this will strengthen your faith and heighten your appreciation for Jehovah, his kingdom and his Word. Engaging in every feature of field service regularly, even taking the lead therein, what joyous blessings and stimulating experiences you will have! Your zeal and enthusiasm will increase. Your good example will be a righteous influence upon those around you. Then, too, as a pioneer you will be more free of worldly entanglements, the snares of a commercialized society. As you “lay aside every weight” that hampers full-time service, this old world will mean even less to you, and your hope in God’s theocratic new world will be enlivened.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> These benefits were vividly portrayed for us by pioneers and missionaries from the world over through their experiences related at the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly. What a stirring and convincing appeal they made as they echoed their invitation, ‘Be a pioneer,’ ‘Come over percentage of these will resubscribe when called upon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>0</sup> Yes, the remaining time before the final end overtakes this sleepy world is short. In fact, it is much nearer than they think. Yet in the brief remaining period thousands must be awakened, aroused and alerted that they may seek refuge in God’s Kingdom organization. We have the instruments of truth in our hands by which this mighty work can be accomplished. Let us make full use of such during the month of October by giving wholehearted and enthusiastic support to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font2">campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">into Macedonia and help us!’ Pioneers continually write telling of the incomparable joys of their treasured service. Why not join them and &quot;taste and see that Jehovah is good”?—Ps. 34:8, A.S.V.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Yes, there will be difficulties. Not as many luxuries, not the best of everything in food, clothing and shelter. Your faith will be tried as with fire, but that is when you learn to depend fully on Jehovah and trust in his mighty arm, which will never be shortened on your behalf. Do not be easily discouraged, but lean heavily on Jehovah and his holy spirit. “Stick to your work” and Jehovah will bless you. Besides, if you left the pioneer service as soon as the going became a little hard would you actually be returning to something better? Hardly. Therefore, properly evaluate your treasure of service as a pioneer and guard it jealously.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">More Pioneers Needed</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> As we approach the final end the demand and need for pioneers increase. Hundreds of isolated counties await pioneers who can work them. Repeated requests for pioneer aid are being received daily from small companies throughout the United States. Truly, the harvest is great and the pioneer laborers few by comparison. Can you help fill that need?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Also, do not forget the pioneer quota is still 10 percent of all publishers. With more than 100,000 publishers in the United States that would mean an army of over 10,000 full-time workers. A number of companies have reached their 10-percent goal, proving that it can be done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup> Many publishers are appreciating their treasure of service and are joining the pioneer ranks. At the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly 281 pioneer applications were filled out. Additionally, 1,730 publishers took pioneer applications home with them, and many of these are now being sent in. Why not insure holding fast to your treasure by increasing your service privileges and entering the full-time pioneer ministry now? A pioneer application awaits you.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">Articles lost and found at both the Yankee Stadium and the trailer camp are now being held at the factory at 117 Adams street.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Are you aware of the shortness of the time until this old world’s final end? Do you appreciate the marvelous privilege you have of being Jehovah’s special ambassador to announce the lateness of the time to a sleeping world? Or have you become so engrossed in the foolish pursuits of this dying old world that you no longer recognize the shortness of the time that remains? If your earnest desire is to receive and enjoy everlasting life in God's new world of righteousness, then you will seriously and closely examine the way that you are using your time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> As time runs out for these last evil days, all who are grateful for the privilege of being Jehovah’s trusted servants will want to take advantage of the time that yet remains to preach the gospel with unflagging zeal. Many more “other sheep” must yet be gathered to the King’s right hand of favor and safety. Therefore, all of Jehovah’s consecrated servants will show proper concern for the everlasting destiny of both themselves and the “other sheep” by following the apostle Paul’s advice to ‘use the remaining time wisely’.—Eph. 5 :15, 16, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R.S.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> With the highlights of the great international convention still fresh in our memories we will be ready and eager to present to the public for the first time the new bound book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This Means Everlasting Life&quot;, </span><span class="font2">on a contribution of 35e, during the month of November.

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Now Is the Time to Study New Legal Booklet</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Among the releases at the Theocracy's Increase Assembly held in New York was the new legal booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News.</span><span class="font2"> This booklet has been prepared and published to aid Jehovah’s witnesses to know their legal rights in carrying out their commission to preach “this gospel of the kingdom”. How very timely is the advice contained in the booklet, for as we draw ever nearer to this old world's final end, more and more is Jesus’ warning, “if they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also,” going to undergo fulfillment. That means, then, each one of Jehovah’s witnesses should study this new provision to be equipped and ready to fight and defend his legal, God-given right to proclaim the good news.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Do you know what your legal and constitutional rights are and how to call upon them when needed? What to do if arrested? How to prepare for trial? How to obtain legal advice? The procedure of a court? Questions that may be asked during the trial? From past studies in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Worship</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Servants Defended</span><span class="font2"> some of this important knowledge has been gained. However, the new booklet supersedes these by bringing the information up to date and adds thereto by citing recent court decisions, giving counsel on how to side-step enemy tactics, showing proper conduct under various conditions, etc. Though few of Jehovah’s witnesses are lawyers by secular vocation, it is, nevertheless, essential for each publisher to study familiar with its contents and to insure effective presentation, all will want to first read and study it themselves.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">All Territory Now New</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> With the introduction of the new book, all territories become new. A careful, systematic coverage of territory should be made so that no one will be denied the opportunity to obtain this timely aid. House-to-house activity should be stressed, and wherever the new book is placed this should be noted and a definite effort made by each of Jehovah’s servants to call back. Calling back will indicate that our purpose isn’t just to place the book, but is also to aid good-will persons in gaining an understanding of the life-giving message contained in its pages. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life&quot; </span><span class="font2">should also be placed on back-calls and at Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Appropriate demonstrations at the service meetings Illustrating a few ways in which the new book can be presented at the doors will aid the publishers to get off to a good start. Companies should order a sufficient supply of the new book now, if this has not already been done, so that publishers will be fully equipped for vigorous and enthusiastic field service activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> The time is short! What remaining time there is should be used wisely. Wise use of our time in the service of the Most High will soon be justified and rewarded, for faithfulness now will prove to Jehovah our dependability to serve him faithfully for all time in his righteous new world.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">and come to know the contents of this new booklet so as to ably cope with any situation that may arise in carrying on the preaching work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Throughout the world at the present time there is much turmoil and uneasiness. The flames of war are smoldering and breaking out, governments are much disturbed, fearful of one another, mobilizing, drafting man power and sounding forth the cry for more patriotism. These and other signs indicate a time of trial, panic and disregard for established law and order, which presages trying times for Jehovah’s witnesses. In fact, already in many parts of the world, including various sections of the United States, the enemy is again active, trying to ‘frame mischief by law’ and causing outbreaks of violence in an effort to disrupt the preaching work. In view of these conditions, the Society recommends that each company of Jehovah’s witnesses start an immediate study of this booklet.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Method of Study</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> It is suggested that the company servant arrange to cover the booklet in a period of three or four months. This can be done by spending ten or fifteen minutes on each service meeting until the study is completed. The material in the booklet is arranged in sections so the main points can be picked out and emphasized in a minimum amount of time. However, to cover the booklet in a few months means advance planning and preparation on the part of those assigned. Make the study interesting by presenting the material in various ways. Some parts can be effectively demon-</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Work Business Territory </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Winter Months Opportune Time</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Is your company working its business districts? Do you work the stores and places of business in your individual territory, or have you avoided these? Does not “all the inhabited earth” in which we are commissioned to preach the good news include the business districts? Certainly, these sections of our territory are not to be overlooked because to some they appear formidable and hard to reach with the Kingdom message. When you meet a businessman at his home while in the service, you do not hesitate to present the truth to him. Hence, view the matter of working your business territory just as positively. Furthermore, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font2"> subscription offer for October and the new book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life&quot;, </span><span class="font2">the literature offer to be featured during November and December, are excellent to present to business people. For they too are interested in world happenings and in preserving and gaining life for themselves and their families.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">How and When</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> When working business, as in other territory, we “become all things to people of all kinds”. Oui<sup>-</sup>conduct must be bold and businesslike, yet remain tactful, pleasant and sincere. Try to meet each one on his own level, never feel or act inferior. Be prepared I Know what you are going to say and in your presentation speak directly and to the point. Wear clean clothes that are tidy, have shoes polished and otherwise present a groomed appearance. This will add to your confidence and poise, which will have a good effect on those to whom you present the message. A brief case or neat envelope is preferable for carrying the literature.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">strated, others considered by question and answer or given as talks, etc. Since the material will be covered rapidly, it would be well to have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> brief oral review or quiz from time to time to be sure that the main points are being retained. It should be remembered in preparing demonstrations that their purpose is to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">illustrate</span><span class="font2"> points and not to entertain or amuse. Using different brethren in the presentations and demonstrations will add interest and enable most publishers to enjoy an active part in the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> While the opportunity is present, let all brethren diligently study this booklet so they will be equipped to defend and legally establish the good news during these last days.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Usually the best procedure in large business houses, offices, stores, etc., is to ask for the person in charge, by his name if you know it, or by his position, such as superintendent, manager, doctor or whatever he may be. If met by a secretary or receptionist wanting to know who you are and the nature of your call, you can give your name and state that your business is personal. After witnessing to the person in charge, he may grant permission to speak to some of the employees that are not too busy. If the person desired is not in, perhaps an appointment for a future call can be made, or you can witness to whomever you are able to contact. In event some places are very busy skip them, keep a record of them and return at a more convenient time. While the best time to work business territory varies with the type of business and the locality, it has been found that the earlj’ morning hours Monday through Friday are the most favorable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Our purpose in working business territory is the same as in other features of Kingdom activity, namely, find and then ‘feed the sheep’. Necessarily this obligates us to make back-calls on business people and conduct home Bible studies with them. So, to the extent that you are able, obtain the names and home addresses of all showing interest and especially those who accept the literature. Where this is not possible, many times these persons can be reached further by telephone. Thereby one can find out what progress they have made in reading the book, extend an invitation to attend meetings and make arrangements for future back-calls or studies. Such concern toward this group of earth’s inhabitants will undoubtedly result in a heartening response from those who are sheeplike.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Servants, Publishers, Pioneers All Take Part</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Small stores, offices and other places of business included in the individual territories should be worked with the rest of the territory. However, in towns and cities where there are large, concentrated business sections, the territory servant, if he has not already done so, will make maps of such sections to be worked as business territory. The method for handling this is the same as that of the regular house-to-house territory. (See paragraphs 95 and 96 of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization for Jehovah’s witnesses.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> Demonstrations showing how to approach the manager of a store, a doctor, lawyer or other businessman can be featured on the service meeting program. This will aid the brethren and stimulate them for this work. Business territory is ideal to work during the winter, for in this work the publisher is indoors most of the time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> Appreciating these facts, the scope of our commission, the need these persons have for the truth, and the fine publications we have to offer them, who can hold back any longer from having a full share in this work? Therefore, servants, make the necessary plans and announce these to the company. Then publishers and pioneers can cooperate in working the business territory. With all getting behind this effort and giving this territory the attention it needs, a grand witness will be given and many more will take in life-giving knowledge, all to the vindication of Jehovah’s name and Word.</span></p></li></ul>

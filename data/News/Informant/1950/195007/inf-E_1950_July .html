<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>NEW YORK CONVENTION!</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Have You Completed Plans to Attend?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Imagine if you can the greatest convention of modern times! That will be the International convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in New York city. Tens of thousands from the ■wide world over assembled for eight days of bounteous spiritual feasting, and Y<sup>r</sup>OU will be there! Do you realize that this month automobiles, trailers, trains, busses, airplanes and boats will be striking out for New York with their loads of joyful con-ventioners? Indeed, the time is at hand; here are the eleventh-hour questions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Have you completed your convention preparations in harmony with the information given in the May and the June &quot;Informant” and other instructions sent out l&gt;y the Society?</span><span class="font3"> If not, do not hesitate any longer to do so. Are you helping all people of good will in your territory to know about this great convention and realize the benefits they will receive by attending? They will surely thank you after the convention for your consideration and express amazement and satisfaction, as did the queen of Sheba, when she said: “The half was not told me.” New York is planning for your arrival; are you planning an arrival in New York?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If anyone has been holding back because of thoughts that there might not be sufficient accommodations, he should immediately disperse such ideas. There are plenty of rooming accommodations available in private homes and hotels. A trailer and tent camp location has been contracted for, and there should be room for all who want such accommodations. Here is some last-minute information on the convention:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rooming</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The rooming accommodations are being obtained in sufficient quantities to accommodate all who will be coming to the convention. The rates are very reasonable too. It is expected that the Rooming Committee will be able to mail out most of the room assignments to the convention-ers who have written in already. However, to those who write later it may not be possible to send assignments in time to reach their home address before they leave for New York. In such cases we shall hold the assignment cards, to be picked up by the delegates upon their arrival. So if you do not receive your assignment card before you leave home, call for it at the Rooming Committee. Up to and including July 28 the Rooming Committee will be at 557 West 157tli street, near Broadway, in Manhattan. From July 29 on, the Committee will be located under the bleacher section of Yankee Stadium, West</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">161st street at River Avenue in the Bronx.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren should make note of the name of the publisher at the top of the room request form that they sent, because that is the way your assignment will be filed. As soon as the publisher receives his assignment, he should write down the address and put it in his wallet or purse, thus avoiding being unable to locate the place where he is staying. Sometimes in the past brethren have lost this Information during the convention and then didn't even know where they left their luggage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you arrive in New York between the hours of eleven o’clock at night and eight in the morning, please do not try to contact your landlady then, but wait until a reasonable hour. It is advisable to arrange for a daylight arrival so rooming accommodations, etc., can easily be located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Needy pioneers will be given the benefit of the most reasonably priced rooms, but all accommodations offered free are being assigned to the brethren from foreign countries who cannot get currency exchange. Most of the pioneers have had time to do secular work and should be in a position to pay some rent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At all times brethren should keep in mind the need for Christian consideration of others. If you have mailed in a request for rooms, then Theocratically accept your assignment and show your consideration and appreciation to the landlady for her hospitality. We would suggest that you do not obtain and hold a room assignment from the Rooming Committee just in case you can’t find something better upon arrival. Many times landladies go to considerable expense and inconvenience to prepare accommodations for the brethren, so you can see the importance of utilizing the assignment you have received from the Rooming Committee. As soon as your plans are made, notify the landlady concerning the time you expect to arrive; and if this is changed, show enough consideration to let her know about it. Remember, brethren, many of these landladies are good will persons already progressing in the truth, while others are rendering their first Christian gestures toward getting acquainted with Jehovah’s witnesses. You will have an excellent opportunity to witness to the landladies, so accept your responsibility of bringing them a spiritual blessing which is very great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hotel Accommodations</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many hotels will hold a reservation until 6 p.m., but in most cases no later unless they are advised of a definite later time of arrival or receive an advance deposit of at least one day’s rent. In some cases the check-in time is even earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren would do well to advise the hotel of their expected time of arrival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Trailer and Tent Camp</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a pleasure to announce that a trailer and tent camp will be set up at the Butterworth farm, Old New Brunswick Road, near New Market, New Jersey. If you are traveling toward New York on U. S. Route 22, near Plainfield you will notice a large sign saying “Turn Right to Dunellen”. Make the right turn and drive through Dunellen to the camp. You will find special signs along the way to direct you to “J. W. Camp”. If you are traveling toward New York on U. S. Route 1, just after you leave New Brunswick turn left at the sign that says “To Camp Kilmer”. From there on you will see “J. W. Camp” signs to guide you to the camp. The camp is about five miles from either of these routes, being easily reached over surfaced roads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Companies of Jehovah’s witnesses have been sent special forms to be filled out by those who want to use the facilities of the camp. If your company has none left, request additional copies from the Watchtow’er Convention Rooming Committee, 557 West 157th street, New’ York 32, New York, and they will be sent. Please use the form when requesting parking space. It will be necessary to make a small charge to those using the camp to cover the expenses of renting the ground and setting up the camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To reach Yankee Stadium from the camp, a distance of 40 miles, you should travel by U. S. Route 1 or 22 to either the Holland or Lincoln Tunnel (probably Lincoln Tunnel will be less congested) or you may use the Erie Ferry, near the Holland Tunnel. When you reach Manhattan take the West Side Express Highway (no trucks permitted) to the 158th Street exit. The bridge at 155th street will take you across the Harlem river<sup>1</sup> to Yankee Stadium. There are no parking facilities right at the stadium, so you will have to park a distance away from the stadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although programs from Yankee Stadium will be transmitted by telephone lines to the camp for the benefit of those on duty there, nevertheless, to get the real blessing from the convention, it is suggested that all campers make it their business to be at the Yankee Stadium daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Information</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The information department is planning to make you as familiar wnth New York as possible during your stay here. The first problem you are probably wondering about is how to find your room assignment when you arrive. We believe those from New England are familiar with New York and will not have difficulty locating their rooming accommodations, using the parkways and express highways when entering the city. If you are traveling from the West or South by car, and your rooming assignment card shows a Brooklyn address, it would be to your advantage to enter New York via the Holland Tunnel on U. S. Route 1, 9 or 22. There will be an information booth at the Esso Service Station at 12th street and Jersey Avenue, Jersey City, just three blocks from the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. Brethren will be on duty 24 hours a day from July 28 to 30 to show you how to get to your room and give you a map of the city as well as a subway map. “Convention Information for Jehovah’s Witnesses” signs will identify the station for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If your rooming assignment card shows a hotel in New York, or such addresses as Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside, Woodside, Maspeth, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Corona, Forest Hills, College Point, Whitestone, Flushing, Broadway, Kew Gardens, Jamaica, Richmond Hill, Hillside, Hollis, St. Albans, Springfield, Laurelton, it would save you time to come into New York via the Lincoln Tunnel, on New Jersey Route 3. Then cross Manhattan island and take either the Queens-Midtown Tunnel or Queensboro Bridge to reach your destination. On N. J. Route 3 there will be an information booth in the Esso Station near Secaucus, New Jersey, about two miles from the Lincoln Tunnel. If you are traveling to the Lincoln Tunnel via the Pulaski Skyway (U.S. 1 and 9), about 3 miles after entering the Skyway at Newark turn off to the right on a ramp marked Lincoln Tunnel. A traffic circle will lead you to Tonnelie Avenue. There will be a booth in the second Esso Station on the right-hand side of Tonnelie Avenue as you travel north on it. These stations will be identified by signs, and there will be brethren there as at the Holland Tunnel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If your rooming assignment card shows New York or Bronx zones, numbered 30 and over, or if you are coining from western New York state to any address in the city, it will be to your advantage to enter New York via the George Washington Bridge. There will tie an information booth on U. S. Routes 1 and 46 and N. J. Route 6 at the Valley View Shell Service Station in Fort I^ee, New Jersey, about two miles from the bridge. Another booth will be on N. J. Route 4 at the Esso Service Station near Englewood, New Jersey, also about two miles from the bridge. Still another booth will be located at the Esso Station on U. S. Route 9W near Englewood Cliffs, about two miles from the bridge. All of these stations are open 24 hours a day, and brethren will be there July 28 to 30 to give you information as to how to get to your room. Incidentally, all these service station managers have been </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 2)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“Theocracy’s Increase” Testimony Period </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare to Spread</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Convention Enthusiasm</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Over seven centuries before Christ, Jehovah God foretold the marvelous increase of his then yet-to-be-born Theocracy when he said, “of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” (Isa. 9:7) Ambassadors of the Theocracy since 1914 can testify to this increase and especially in the service year of 1950, ending in August. An increase to Jehovah’s praise and to our joy! But the end is not yet; many more must hear, be comforted and join the ever-increasing throng on the march to the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The New York convention will be another step along this march; and the enthusiasm absorbed there can be a real inspiration to us in aiding others. Brethren who could not attend will want to know about the convention, as will those we call on and hold studies with. It will be our privilege to tell them about it personally and to invite them to the service meetings where a resume of the Theocracy's advance at the convention should be presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every servant of the Theocracy will want to bring this eventful service year to a fitting close by preaching to others and reporting the time to the company. Separate reports for July and August should be sent to the Society. The offer for the month will be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> or another bound book, on a 35c contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The effects of the convention will undoubtedly be widely felt, and many new ambassadors of the Theocracy will join with us in service. Plan now for the work that will follow the convention so that you and the new ones you are privileged to aid may share in the Increase of Jehovah’s Theocracy as it grows to fill the whole earth.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Special Train Information</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has arranged to have the final date for joining special trains extended from July 10 to July 19. This allows nine additional days to purchase tickets and make reservations. However, railroad tickets should be purchased and reservations made just as soon as possible, so that proper and sufficient equipment can be ordered for the trains. (See paragraphs 13-19 Watchtower Convention Transportation Information. ) Transportation servants, please take note and' arrange accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society’s request for special train fares has been denied. Therefore, regular train fares will apply on all trains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 4) </span><span class="font3">very cooperative, and since gasoline is cheaper in New Jersey than New York many of the brethren will plan on gassing up while they are getting their maps and information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you are traveling by bus, train or airplane, you will find information booths at the Greyhound Bus Terminals, Pennsylvania Station, Grand Central Station, Newark Airport and La Guardia Airport. All of these will be operated by our brethren and will be available on a 24-hour basis from July 28 to 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thousands of territories are being made up now so all can participate in field service activities. You should come prepared to take part in some feature of Kingdom service. Bring only enough literature with you for use in witnessing on the trip. A large bookroom will provide for literature needs during the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There will be field service territories and equipment available at the Yankee Stadium and at the Kingdom Halls throughout the four largest boroughs of the city. It will not be necessary for anyone to come to the stadium to engage in field service. In most cases much time will be saved if you get territory and literature at the nearest Kingdom Hall. Thus more actual field service will be done. To determine the contact point nearest your room will not be difficult. On your room assignment card you will notice a territory number. This number has two letters preceding it. These letters identify the contact points for field service nearest your room. The following tabulation will give you the address of your nearest field service center:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Y 1542 Fulton Street, Brooklyn 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Volunteer Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To make the convention a success many departments must be organized. Volunteers will be required for cafeteria work, operating refreshment stands, bookroom work, directing traffic, ushering, playing music, first-aid service, and maintenance. Brethren who plan to volunteer for cafeteria or maintenance work should bring appropriate clothing for use during the work periods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A number of plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and tinsmiths and other skilled craftsmen will be required at the convention. Some will be needed a week prior to the opening of the convention. It will be appreciated very much if brethren who are able and willing to do such work and can come early will please fill out a Volunteer Service form and address it to the Watchtower Convention, 557 West 157th street, New York 32, New York, immediately and state their qualifications, as well as the date they plan to arrive in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A large staff of cooks and persons familiar with cafeteria work will be required, and we invite such to volunteer at the convention. Doctors and nurses may wish to serve in first-aid work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A small orchestra will be organized, and publishers who are experienced musicians and wish to share in orchestral activities should report to the volunteer service department. Bring your instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Baptism</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Arrangements are being made to hold a baptism. Those who plan to be immersed should be prepared with bathing suits and towels. This matter should be announced to the companies at meetings during the last two weeks of July as a reminder to the delegates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Other Details</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the benefit of those who have never been to New York we wish to state that there is no reason to be frightened on account of the largeness of the city. Everything is well regulated here. The people may be in a little more of a hurry than in other cities, but they are generally very helpful when you ask them for information. New York has a large police force and they are trained to help visitors, so always feel free to ask them for directions or information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An ordinance in New York requires car drivers to always remove keys from the car when parking on streets. It is a good practice to always lock your car when you park it, and we suggest that you never leave luggage, cameras, clothing or anything of value visible in your car even though it is locked. It is best to lock your personal belongings in the trunk. Be sure to observe all parking and traffic regulations. And in crowds it is always good to be aware of the possible presence of pickpockets and thieves, for the stadium will be open to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many of the brethren will be coming by automobile. Inquiries have been received about the parking facilities at Yankee Stadium. There is really no parking space at the stadium, so we suggest that wherever possible you leave your car at your rooming location and come to the stadium by subway. New York has a very efficient subway system, which is not only the fastest way to get around in New York, but the cheapest, and there are two subway lines with stations at the entrance to Yankee Stadium. It is possible to transfer from busses and other subway lines to the lines that pass the stadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If your room is In a hotel, the hotels usually provide garage space for their patrons; but this service is $1.00 to $2.00 per 24 hours per auto. It is prohibited to park your car on the streets overnight or during business hours in mid-town Manhattan; check with the doorman or reception desk on parking regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is a 5-percent city tax levied on all hotel accommodations, so brethren should be prepared to pay this when they pay their hotel bills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No automobile signs will be provided by the Society for this convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mail</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you desire to receive mail while in New York, please give your correspondents your personal room address. Do not plan on receiving any mail at the stadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Toilet Facilities</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Toilet facilities are always crowded at conventions. Yankee Stadium will be no exception. If you travel to the stadium by subway, you may find it convenient to use the subway public toilets before you enter the stadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Deaf Mutes</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the benefit of our deaf brethren, an interpreter will be located in the box seat area of Section 24 in the lower stands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Photography</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All official pictures for the convention will be taken by the photography department. No others will be allowed to take pictures on the field, but it will be all right to take any pictures you wish from the grandstand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recording</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many have asked about the facilities for personal wire recorders. Arrangements will be made to accommodate the brethren, and information on this may be obtained at the information counter at the stadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sound Cars</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All who plan to bring sound cars to New York should write to the convention offices immediately and inform the brethren here concerning the type of equipment and whether it is in good condition. The Convention Committee will notify you if your sound car is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Visit Headquarters</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Take this opportunity to visit the Bethel Home, the Watchtower factory, WBBR transmitter at Staten Island, and Gilead (South Lansing, New York). The home and factory will be open for inspection following the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before us there is a golden opportunity to give a great testimony to the honor of Jehovah’s name and at the same time equip ourselves for the big world-wide expansion campaign just ahead. The convention time is near. We are confident of many blessings being poured out. Has not Jehovah already promised, “Prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it”? (Mal. 3:10, A.S.F.) So let us believe Jehovah as we rally together with expansion In our minds, take into company with us many good will persons, and prepare to attend the great international convention in New York city.</span></p>

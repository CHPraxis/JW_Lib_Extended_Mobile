</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Advertise the International Assembly</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">One of the things that particularly identifies the Lord’s consecrated servants today is the name they bear as Jehovah’s witnesses. What a lofty privilege it is for insignificant man to bear the majestic name of the glorious Creator who alone is Jehovah ! Those that accept the name, however, must also accept the responsibility that such a privilege places upon them. They cannot be witnesses in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font3"> only; they must live up to the name.—Isa. 43: 10, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A. S. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How do Jehovah’s witnesses live up to the name? By living exemplary Christian lives, which are built around concentrated activity in field service. Out on the busy streets and to the homes they go, praising Jehovah and magnifying his name before all who will hear. While in this service of the King they deport themselves as befitting ambassadors of his heavenly kingdom. Their speech at the doors is pleasant, graced with good things about Jehovah. Their conduct in the homes is irreproachable so as not to stigmatize or cast reflection on his holy name and cause some to stumble. In all their service they display Theocratic tact and the attributes of the God they worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During June part of living up to the name will be offering to the people three bound books on a contribution of $1.00. In most cases the three latest books will be used, but any of the campaign volumes in stock may be presented. Demonstrations should be planned around the literature you will be using. The value of these various publications cannot be overstated, for they make known the name of Jehovah, how to serve him and live up to his name. Isn't this the people’s greatest need?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are yet thousands of goodwill persons who will accept Jehovah's name. Before these can live up to the name they must be found and instructed. A house-to-house search must be made for them. In view of this we cannot ignore this important feature of service. These initial contacts furnish the basis for by far the majority of our future back-calls and home Bible studies. Those living up to the name should make it a point to engage regularly in the house-to-house activity ; and group witnessing for this purpose should be arranged from the company book-study locations and the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Stress Back-Calls and Talk Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As you extol Jehovah’s name in your door-to-door witnessing be sure to make a record of all placements and where interested ones live. Not only should you inform these prospective praisers that you will return, but keep your word and call back. Jehovah is a dependable God; those living up to his name must likewise show dependability as well as patience and loving consideration toward interested ones. The sheeplike ones who invite you into their homes look to you as a minister of God. Their future progress will be influenced by the example you set for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The international assembly in New York city will make an excellent talking point on your back-calls and Bible studies. Review past assemblies for them. Whet their appetites for these joyous spiritual feasts which Jehovah serves to those bearing his name. Though the Society does not have any in stock, it may be that publishers have personal copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger </span><span class="font3">from previous conventions, which can be reviewed to arouse interest for this grand event. Many of them will desire to attend, and there is yet time for them to make plans. Perhaps they can be assisted in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Also, let us not neglect to cal] on the regular subscribers to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazines. Keep their interest alive, and aid them to renew their subscription before it expires. Expiration slips for those subscriptions which do expire will, of course, provide an additional source of back-calls, and you should continue to contact these as their names are sent to your company. Since assemblies play such a vital part in magnifying Jehovah’s name, an enthusiastic discussion about the international convention may be just the stimulus needed to reawaken interest in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> and in the Kingdom. Make the most of these opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Live Up to the Name at All Times</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Living up to the name is not restricted to oui<sup>-</sup> direct service activities. It extends further than that. It is a full-time obligation. Though field service reports show that publishers, on the average, spend less than one hour each day in actual preaching, we, nevertheless, bear Jehovah’s name all day long. This means, then, that our daily lives must be a living testimony exalting Jehovah’s greatness. In our dealings with this world we must reflect al] the dignity and superlative qualities that his name stands for. We are ‘a spectacle to men and angels’, and our course of action will commend to others the wisdom of serving Jehovah and living up to his name. How necessary, then, to keep the name of Jehovah always before those of the world as well as those upon whom we regularly call. In this way we will be living up to the name, Jehovah will be the prominent</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>President Opens Rooming Work</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">On Saturday night, May 13, at St. Nicholas Arena, in the heart of New York city, 4,837 publishers from the city and surrounding companies assembled together to discuss their share in the 1950 International Convention. Gladly and with great enthusiasm they accepted the role of hosts. Up until the time of that meeting they had been looking ahead, but with it came a first taste of the convention Itself. The president of the Society, Brother Knorr, opened the meeting, describing the program to be accomplished and showing the responsibilities of it all upon the local publishers. Instructions were given as to how to select rooming accommodations, what to look for and how to eliminate the undesirable ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since there is very little hope of a trailer camp’s being established, many more rooms in private homes will have to be found. It is true there are many more hotels in New York city than in other cities, but most of the hotels are keeping permanent guests and not so many rooms are available. The Convention Bureau helped by having its member hotels pledge rooms, and so at the time of the meeting there were 8,700 rooms pledged for convention use, which might accommodate approximately 20.000 people. More rooms will be obtained from other hotels in the city, but the majority of the conventioners will be housed in private homes. That will be a good thing, too, for it is in the</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">108,144 Publishers in April! 5th Consecutive Peak!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">Once again Jehovah has accomplished the seemingly impossible through his devoted servants. Who would have dreamed that an even greater increase would follow so closely on the heels of March's outstanding peak? Truly, Jehovah is doing great things for his people. Think of it; an Increase of 12,143 in only two months!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This remarkable growth has called for strenuous and consistent effort. Servants, individual publishers and pioneers have all had to plan, assist and work hard. But it has been worth the added effort, hasn’t it? Do you think we should stop now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">one, aud sincere efforts will be blessed indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Remember, bearing Jehovah’s name is the grandest privilege any human creature can have conferred upon him. It is also a serious responsibility, a twenty-four-hours-a-day job, requiring all of our time and attention. With all publishers in each company uniting their efforts and working closely together, a tremendous witness can be accomplished. So hold on to your privileged position as Jehovah’s witnesses and rejoice in the blessings reserved for those who are truly living up to the name. homes of the people that impressions are made and a witness is given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The report of the Convention Committee showed that a few thousand room request forms had been received and that the mails were pouring in with hundreds more. It will be a help to the Committee to have the room request forms early, so the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> here reminds all to send in room request forms as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An outline of the convention departments is being drawn up, and the volunteer service applications have come in handy in this work. Now is the time to lay the foundations of a smooth-working convention organization. Let us know what you can do to help. If you have not sent your company’s forms in, please mail them soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We also learned that approximately two thousand brethren are listed as coming from countries outside of the United States and Canada, from all corners of the earth. More than fifty countries and islands of the sea will be represented at the New York convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This year it will not be necessary to call in hundreds of pioneers months in advance for the preconvention work, because the publishers of Greater New York are taking on the work. They are a joyful lot. Yes, the convention spirit is really evident in New York city. If you ask the publishers here, this is what they’ll tell you: “We’re setting everything ready for you. Be sure to come. Be here all eight days, and don’t miss any part of the convention.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Or should we strive for even higher goals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Certainly, we all hope for further increases; none want to drop back now. And how can we keep up this healthy progress? Keep pace with the Theocracy! Its triumphant forward march will continue until the whole earth rings with praise to Jehovah! There can be no decrease if each publisher will keep in step, “preach the word” regularly each month and aid another who is not as strong. We, his servants, sow and water, and to show his approval “Jehovah gives the increase”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God created the universe and every living thing in it. Therefore, everything in the universe belongs to Jehovah. That means that we, then, as human creatures, are a part of his possession, and everything that we have and enjoy belongs to him. In appreciation of this fact, we have indicated our love to Jehovah by making a vow of consecration and offering our lives and everything we possess in unselfish service to him. “Caesars” of this world, under the influencing power of Satan, try to encroach upon or even demand that we not keep this vow. Attempts are made, and will continue to be made, to regiment our time; but we will be careful to pay Caesar only what belongs to Caesar, and pay God what belongs to God. With lifeinsuring wisdom the wise man declared : “When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.” —Eccl. 5:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Arrange to Keep Service Activities Alive</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With joyous anticipation, most of the Lord's servants are making preparations to attend the rapidly approaching convention. However, this should not completely overshadow our regular service activities during this convention month. Conscious effort should be made to keep all features of service reasonably well supported, and certainly every publisher will want to devote some time to Kingdom service, so as to be a regular publisher right through the convention period. To aid us in fulfilling our vows to Jehovah during the month of July, the offer that will be featured is a bound</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Campaign Exceeds 180,000 Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The 12th annual </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription campaign came to a conclusion with 180,829 new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions obtained in the United States by the end of April. This great campaign has again proved its value by opening up thousands of new homes and many more minds to the message of truth presented through the pages of these two Christian magazines. In view of our campaign quota of 180,000 new subscriptions for the United States, the total obtained reflects sincere effort on the part of God’s servants and his blessing on their activity. Another quota exceeded I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The total of 180,829 subscriptions is based upon field service reports turned in by United States companies and pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the months to come these new subscribers will benefit to varying degrees from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font3">depending upon whether they read it; and whether after reading they understand. Hence it is essential that each publisher call back upon those persons who subscribed from him and aid them to realize the full value of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Are you conscientiously doing this? If you are, then next year there will be fewer expiring subscriptions. Instead, many subscribers will have renewed; yes. and some will be active witnesses themselves, taking the good news to others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Rather than waiting till after the convention to prepare to carry on public meetings, companies will want to make preparations in advance so that the public lecture series can take up immediately thereafter. Also, to take care of the good-will interest and the publishers who do not attend the convention, companies can make plans now to organize the remaining brethren so that field service arrangements and meetings can continue during the convention period. All of the brethren should keep in mind to render whatever assistance is possible to aid both those of good-will and brethren in less fortunate circumstances to come to the assembly and share in its wonderful blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the way to the convention many opportunities will be presented to witness and thus pay our vows to God. By taking advantage of all opportunities to preach the Word, and by conducting ourselves as true ministers of God, a heap of witness will be given from one end of the country to the other. Be sure to keep a record of all the time spent in witnessing while going to, attending and returning from the convention, as this should be turned in to the local company upon return. Companies should send their July report to the Society as soon as possible after the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With all of Jehovah’s servants keeping in mind their consecration vows to God, they will not neglect their service activities during the month of July, nor allow Caesar and this world to interfere with such service. Instead, they will make full use of all their opportunities and thereby “pay God what belongs to God”.—Matt. 22 : 21, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Circuit Servant Visits Discontinued During Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the week-end of July 23, 1950, all circuit servants will discontinue visiting the companies. Their work with the companies will be resumed on Tuesday, August 15. This will allow a three-week period to attend the international convention in New York and enjoy a vacation from the regular routine of the circuit work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Circuit assemblies, which have been suspended since March 26, will be started again on Friday, September 1, 1950. Undoubtedly the circuit assemblies and the visits of the circuit servants will do much to emphasize the blessings of the international convention and further strengthen the publishers for the important work of gospel-preaching yet ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If your company is notified that the circuit servant's visit or the circuit assembly will closely follow the convention, you should make as much of the preparation as possible before you leave for New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">is over, but its effects will be felt on into eternity by those who learn and heed the truth. We rejoice now as we look back upon the results of faithful, determined effort. How much more we can rejoice when In the months to come we look back upon having aided these same subscribers to get safely on the way to life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Call for Pioneers Continues</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gratifying, indeed, is the response to the call for pioneers. Why, in one week alone over 400 applications for pioneer service were sent out! True, it may be that not every one of these publishers will realize his goal to enter the pioneer service, but it is evident that they are thinking, planning and working toward that end. There is every reason to believe that the majority of these brethren will continue on, with Jehovah’s help, to complete this forward step. But there are undoubtedly many others with the same heart's desire and whose circumstances might be altered sufficiently to make pioneering possible. To these the call for pioneers continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With this issue of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font3">another pioneer letter is being sent. There is a personal copy for each publisher, so that it can be prayerfully considered in private study in addition to being discussed at the service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do not conclude that pioneering is only for others. Have you calmly and dispassionately reviewed your circumstances before the Lord? Can you foresee adjustments which might be made to overcome those things which prevent you from being a pioneer? If, as a result of this personal examination of your circumstances, you believe you can embark on the wise course and heed the call for pioneers, send now for your application. Having taken that step, continue to work positively toward being a pioneer, looking to Jehovah for guidance and help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Order Public Meeting Handbills Early</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The factory will be closed during the convention, July 30 through August 6. No orders will be filled nor correspondence answered during this time. Handbills for public meetings which are now being planned for August and September should be ordered by July 1, in order to be printed and mailed in time for your use. Letters containing orders for handbills should be plainly marked HANDBILL ORDER on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">outside of the envelope.</span><span class="font3"> Any other matters requiring immediate attention before the convention should be marked RUSH on the envelope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazines and Mail During Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the latter part of July and the first part of August, the majority of the publishers will be away from their home companies to attend the international convention in New York. Arrangements should be made in advance to take care of personal and company mail during this absence so that it will not be returned to the Society. If you will carefully note the suggestions given below much expense and inconvenience can be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers and Individuals who receive </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">direct in individual rolls or by subscription should arrange for a friend, neighbor or another witness, who is not attending the convention, to pick up and care for their magazines and other mail regularly. It might be well to mention to your postman that you will be gone for a short while but that your mail should still be delivered and you have arranged to have it cared for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If the one who regularly receives the distributors’ copies is to be away, please see that someone is appointed to take care of them and arrange for their distribution in the field. Company servants and others who may be expecting literature shipments or other mail from the Society should leave definite instructions as to how it is to be cared for to avoid return of mail or costly storage charges on literature shipments. Please do not leave these matters until the last minute and then forget to care for them, as it will mean much needless expense and inconvenience.</span></p>

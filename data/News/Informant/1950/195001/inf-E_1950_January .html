<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Know</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Offer;</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Present</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Offer</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Who is the Supreme One? Who shall rule the universe? In this great issue is locked the destiny of all humankind. For those who decide in favor of Satan and his system there will be but one end—death. Conversely, the wise who side with Jehovah and his Theocratic government will be rewarded with an unexcelled gift—eternal life. To proclaim this issue of universal domination God has raised up his ministers, ministers for the issue. Here are men, women and children positively upholding God’s side of the universal question! Here are men, women and children who “bless . . . the Lord” and “do his pleasure”.—Psalm 103: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“do</span><span class="font3"> his pleasure” indicates action on the part of Jehovah’s ministers. And action it will be as ministers for the issue swing into the twelfth annual </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign beginning January, 1950.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During 1949 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> upheld the issue in over a score of different languages to the number of 23,190,737 copies. Doers of God’s pleasure realize the effectiveness of this instrument in making known the issue and during January these ministers will offer a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> together with a free eight-booklet premium on a $1 contribution. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> without a premium may be offered to those already having </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower:</span><span class="font3"> or the 8 booklets may be left for 25c with those unable to subscribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The advantages of obtaining and reading </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> are many. Primarily, it provides “meat in due season”, enabling truth-seekers to know Jehovah, his purposes and his Word. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> does not claim to be inspired, but It </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font3"> awake to unfolding Bible prophecies. It is impartial and adheres strictly to the Bible as authority for its comments. Free from old world ties, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoieer</span><span class="font3"> stands fearlessly for Jehovah’s side of the vital universal issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Though the ever-present theme of Jehovah’s supremacy is noted in each issue, the subject matter of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is varied. In 1949 ministers of God, as well as men of good-will, enjoyed and benefited from such articles as “Bible Study, a Royal Requirement”, “Messiah’s Presence,” “Love’s Expression,” “Israel,” and many others. Articles on various Bible characters provided groundwork for future Bible study. Highly informative reports on world travel in connection with the ministry interested </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> readers, as did published experiences from ministers upholding the issue in the field. Indeed, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> readers are well-informed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Supplementing its spiritual value,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Watchtower</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"> Campaign</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> offers other features to aid the reader in getting the most from the magazine. Timesaving questions search out the main thoughts in each paragraph. When necessary, explanatory footnotes appear to clarify and document information presented. A systematic study schedule is published in each issue for use by companies of Jehovah’s witnesses as well as individual subscribers. Dozens of Scripture texts are cited and quoted to support material presented, thus obviating the need of spending many hours of individual search to locate such scriptures. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscribers also have the advantage of considering Scripture texts in the light of various Bible translations and versions, eliminating the necessity’ of gathering all of these many’ versions and translations for private study. In fact, since its first publication in 1879 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> has cited or quoted from more than 40 English versions of the Bible or portions of the Bible. Backed by painstaking research and with information presented in exemplary grammatical style, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">is indeed a magazine for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Additional Aids</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In presenting the offer some may find it advantageous to utilize the December 15 issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> which carries the Scripture Index for the Leading Articles and the Subject Index for the preceding year. Using this, one can briefly point out some of the varied subjects treated and how they are of extraordinary value in gaining a knowledge of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The service meeting can also add impetus to the 1950 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">campaign by considering the importance of the four-month activity, the advantages of engaging in it, ways and means of presenting the offer, the progress of the campaign in your company and how you are meeting the quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In view of the importance of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and the predominant part it plays in making known the issue, let us unite in the 12th </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign, praising the Lord and preaching his Word. Or, as the psalmist so aptly expressed it: “Bless ye the Lord, all . . . ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.” —Ps. 103: 21.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Are You Using the New Handbill Order Blank?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">In the May, 1949, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> it was pointed out that a new handbill order blank is now provided that is more convenient both for the companies and for the Society. All companies should have supplies by this time, but many are still using the old form. It will help to eliminate confusion if all companies will destroy any supplies of the old form</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finding a person of good-will who wishes to subscribe for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is only one of a series of things that must be done if we are to accomplish our mission, for if the person fails to receive his magazine or if there is undue delay his goodwill may change to an attitude of indifference or open hostility. We want to serve the subscribers, to make sure that the subscription is received and that the person benefits as much as possible therefrom. That is why the Society issues instructions which, if followed, insure prompt receipt of the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First of all, accuracy is essential. The publisher must be certain that he fills out the subscription slip accurately; and then it must be properly handled by the company. A sheet entitled “How to Handle Subscriptions Properly” has been previously sent to each company. (Companies not having one will receive one on request.) This should again be thoroughly considered by the servants and by the company as a whole, after which it should be posted so that all may consider it and follow the instructions therein set out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Closely associated with the necessity for accuracy is that of promptness. Publishers should turn in their subscriptions Immediately and the company should forward them without delay to the Society. Occasionally complaints are received over non-receipt of magazines when the Society has not yet received the subscriptions, either because they are never sent or because they are held by the company until a month or more has elapsed. Now is the time to organize the handling of subscriptions so that this will not occur in your company. Send in subscriptions promptly each week; then the subscriber should receive his first issue within a month (or two months when the magazine is printed outside of the United States).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some companies have been stamping the name of the company on their subscription slips with a rubber stamp. This is all right provided it is not done before giving the slips to the publishers. If that is done the slips may be turned in at another company by a visiting publisher or at a circuit assembly and</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Rooms and Volunteers for 1950</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Individuals desiring rooms for the 1950 convention cannot yet be served, since the rooming committee has not begun to function; nor are preconvention workers yet being selected. Please -wait until the regular room request forms are sent or until pre-convention volunteers are requested, rather than correspond relative to these matters now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">they may now have on hand and use only the new one henceforth. The new blank measures 5J by 8j inches and has the date 3/49 in the lower left-hand corner. then the wrong company name is on the slip. Instead, stamp the company name on AFTER the publisher turns in the subscription. Perhaps this can best be done after the record sheet is filled out. The name of the company sending in the subscriptions should always appear on the subscription slips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is available in an ever-growing number of languages, but care should be taken not to accept subscriptions in languages which are not available. The latest list of languages in which </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> can be obtained appears below:</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Change in Name or Address of Company Servants</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Whenever there is a change in the name or address of the company servant the Society should now be notified on the “Change of Address” form (SP-2) provided for this purpose. The form previously used only by pioneers and circuit servants has been revised to include company servants as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A supply of six of these forms is being mailed to each company with the January </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> Pioneers are still required to supply this information as heretofore but those working with companies may now obtain their form from the company, and the company can reorder them as needed. Pioneers working in isolated territory will continue to order their own supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who use this form should always check the proper square to indicate whether they are company servants, pioneers or circuit servants, and the form should be sent at least two weeks in advance whenever possible, to allow the change to be made in the Society’s stencils. It is hoped that this will eliminate needless and expensive mis-sendlng of mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It should be noted that this form should </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font3"> be used by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> subscribers. Hence it should not be put out where it will be confused with the L-201 form </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">that is provided for that purpose.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Follow Up Placements</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">“Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” Would you like to be invited to “come” and live in the new world forever under the King, Christ Jesus? If so, you must now get on his right side and have a part in the separating work he is directing, because only those who do will receive his favor and the invitation to life.—Matt. 25: 33, 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The nations, without exception, are on his left side. They will not change their position, for they refuse to hear the Kingdom message which makes known how to do so; yet within the nations are multitudes of good-will persons who desire the King’s favor. For their benefit the reigning King sends his trusted servants to bid these sheeplike ones to separate themselves from the nations, take their stand on his right side, serve him and live. All Theocratic ministers are invited to share in this blessed dividing work during the “Separating to the Right” Testimony Period in February by presenting a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> for $1, and the free premium of eight booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls an Avenue for Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the time February’s activity begins thousands of subscriptions will already be pouring into the Society’s office. But that will be only the start! For many, many more persons will undoubtedly recognize the benefits of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and subscribe if given the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who have previously manifested interest in the Kingdom message are obviously the most likely to avail themselves of the benefits of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> For example, there are those who obtained </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font3"> during November and December, individuals who have received sample copies of the magazine, those on magazine routes, persons who formerly subscribed but who have allowed their subscriptions to expire as indicated by the expiration slips sent to the company by the Society, and, of course, those upon whom we regularly make back-calls and with whom we conduct Bible studies. All of these persons of good-will need to regularly receive </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> We can reach them by making back-calls. Remember, the back-call work is a provision of the King to advance others to his favored side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Following Up Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Getting a subscription is only the first step, for the subscriber must usually receive further help to separate to the right. Back-calls are necessary even after the subscription is obtained. Show the person that you are interested in more than simply taking a subscription, by delivering copies until his magazines start coming in the mail. To be sure that the subscriber not only receives </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> but also understands it have in mind starting a study as soon as possible. This requires preparation: studying the current issue before making the call, so that an interesting point can be discussed. For example: One might call attention to the varied means of preaching employed by religion in contrast with the method used by Jehovah's witnesses. After raising the question, “Which is the proper way?” the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">article “Preach the Word” could be used to provide the Scriptural answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible study servant can improve the following-up of subscriptions if he will examine the Publisher's Record cards from time to time and note those publishers obtaining subscriptions but not making back-calls. He can then give them practical aid in making effective </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> back-calls. It is essential to call back on these subscribers. You may be sure that the Devil will endeavor to minimize the importance of the magazine in the mind of new subscribers and will work through neighbors, religious ministers, members of the family and others to keep the magazine from being studied. Yes, Satan wants to keep them on his side, which is the wrong place for any who would live in the new world. Regular calls pointing out the King’s commands as they are called to attention through the columns of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> will defeat the wily one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Be diligent, then, in planning your service during February so that all avenues of obtaining subscriptions are used. Be prepared to point out vital information as you call back on subscribers. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is the most important magazine on earth, but only to those understanding its life-giving message. Use it well, that you may have the privilege of aiding others to separate to the King’s right hand.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Circuit Servant’s Visit Important</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">That the brethren may make ample preparation for attending the international convention in New York city, July 30 to August 6. 1950, circuit assemblies will be discontinued following the week-end of March 26. All who will have assemblies between now and that time are now being notified. Circuit assemblies will be resumed in the fall of 1950 after the convention in New York. Circuit servants will continue, however, to serve the companies in the regular manner until further notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One step toward fully utilizing the provision of this important visit of the circuit servant is to give careful attention to the letter of notification which he sends to each company about two months prior to his visit. This letter should be read to the company at the first service meeting and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study after it is received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Advance preparation is essential. This includes following the instruction given in the letter and in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Counsel on Theocratic Organization </span><span class="font3">relative to his visit.

<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Are You Using It in Field Service?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The catalogue is an instrument which the Lord has provided as a specific aid for his servants. It can be very effectively used in acquainting persons of good-will with the Bible helps supplied by the Society. The catalogue, placed with those showing a hearing ear, will point them to these publications containing life-giving information. Have you been using it regularly? If your supply is depleted you may obtain more by ordering from Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When engaging in the house-to-house activity, introduce the catalogue wherever particular interest is found. The brief summary of the contents of each publication listed therein will often arouse the householder’s desire to have other publications and will reduce much of the publisher's explanation. A catalogue so placed provides an opportunity to make a back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Similarly, when placing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> on street corners you may give a catalogue to those persons obtaining magazines and who show marked interest. This same procedure can be applied on your magazine route. When placing magazines with regular obtained, leave a catalogue and acquaint them with these Bible helps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On back-calls the catalogue can be used to good advantage also. Some of the listed Bible helps may appeal to the person and he can obtain them to further aid him in his study. It might also be suggested that these good-will persons acquaint their friends and neighbors with the literature listed in the catalogue. At the close of a public meeting, the catalogue can be given, along with the other booklet, to strangers who display interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In all avenues of the Lord’s service, the catalogue is of real value. It is an instrument to aid good-will persons to know of the availability of important Bible information. Use it well. that all are prepared. Do not wait until the circuit servant arrives before making these and other preparations. If you are not sure about something, go ahead to the best of your ability and the circuit servant can offer suggestions to avoid the difficulty in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Much of the valuable counsel given in the various talks by the circuit servant is designed to fit the needs of the individual company being served. Each publisher should therefore attend all of these meetings and seek to personally apply the suggestions given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is also profitable for the company to review from time to time the circuit servant’s report on the company, a copy of which is retained in the company file. This will aid the company to overcome any weaknesses before the next visit of the circuit servant. Do not neglect any opportunity to profit from the circuit servant’s visit. It is important to expansion and progress.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Companies Ordering for Pioneers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Companies ordering supplies which will be used in part by pioneers should always indicate the number of pioneers in the company in the space provided on the order blank. Failure to do so may result in the order’s being reduced to cover the expected needs of the company publishers only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From time to time pioneers may request certain items which the company does not have in stock and which must therefore be ordered from the Society especially for the pioneers. If the company orders such items the Society will charge the company at the regular company rate even though it is stated that the items are for pioneers. The Society does not charge any item on a company invoice at pioneer rates. The company should request the difference between the amount received from the pioneer and the amount which it is charged by the Society by using the Literature Credit Request form. This difference in rates is then credited to the company’s account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In some instances it may be more convenient for the pioneer to order such special items on a separate order blank sent in with the company order. When this is done the items are charged to the pioneer at pioneer rates, as the company is not involved in the transaction. They will usually, however, be shipped with the company order. It should be kept in mind that a remittance must accompany cash item orders by pioneers unless the pioneer’s account has sufficient credit balance to cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whenever pioneer and company orders are sent in together with a remittance to cover, separate remittance forms should be included. It is not necessary to send separate checks or money orders, although this may be done if desired; but in every instance it will be necessary for the Society to know how much of the remittance is to be applied to the company’s order and how much to that of the pioneer.</span></p>

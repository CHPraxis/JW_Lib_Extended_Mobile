<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Get ready, get set, go into the held with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription offer in January ! Brace up your minds for real new-nation activity, for this is the beginning of our seventeenth annual </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign. (1 Pet. 1:13, AGP) For four months we shall effectively offer the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoiver</span><span class="font4"> subscription and three booklets for $1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> “How are you doing?” is a question we shall be asking one another throughout this campaign. As congregation publishers we shall try to obtain at least two new subscriptions and as pioneers, sixteen. Not in a competitive spirit will the question be asked, but rather in a co-operative spirit, because we are interested in the progressive </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign results and wish to see thousands more receive “their food at the proper time.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Work Together</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> At each service center conductors will be alert to keep the group informed of its progress in obtaining subscriptions. At service meetings and service centers, by passing along suggestions we have found helpful, we shall be able to assist each other to be more effective. Theocratic companions In the training work will assist each other by preparing sermons and using them in the field.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> At the Kingdom Hall the congregation servant might arrange </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> chart to show the week-by-week progress of the congregation, for all will be wondering: “How are we doing?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Where shall we get all these new subscriptions? It will be mostly in the house-to-house work. So, then, let us all work at least two hours or more from house to house on Sunday morning, as well as whenever else we can during the week. The more house-to-house work we do, the more opportunities for placing subscriptions we shall have.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Do not forget to include the new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font4"> in each set of three booklets. Along with it use older 32- or 64-page booklets in stock. Place this new booklet in as many homes as possible, for it opens another avenue of starting studies. Its simple, clear logic appeals to all people and the questions enable us to use it as a study aid. (See demonstration in “Your Service Meeting.”)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">A New Slogan</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Speaking of studies, notice the new slogan on the back page: “Add to your regular house-to-house preach-ingback-call andBible study service.” For two years we have stressed regular house-to-house preaching in our slogan and the results have been excellent. Logically, the next step is to improve our back-calls and studies </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">as we continue to share fully in house-to-house work.</span><span class="font4"> So keep the slogan before you, with your minds braced up for new-nation activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Handbills Successfully Used with “The New World Society in Action”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> In an effort to determine the effectiveness of using handbills to advertise showings of “The New World Society in Action” the following experiment was conducted by one of the New York city units, under the Society’s direction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> When the film was first released in April, 1954, publishers with the unit personally invited persons of good will to attend. A total of 253, a good attendance, saw the film.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Then came the possibility of using handbills. How would they work? As an experiment the unit scheduled the film two nights in succession. Both dates were printed on the handbills so that people could come the evening of their convenience.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Extensive and special advertising arrangements were made. Five times the usual number of handbills ordered to advertise a public meeting were obtained and used. Street advertising was done with handbills Friday. Saturday morning all stores and businessmen in the area were called on. Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning house-to-house work</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Conventions for 1955</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The Society is happy to announce the United States and Canadian conventions for 1955 so all can make their vacation plans to attend whichever one of the five suits their convenience. The conventions for this year will be five days in length, so arrange your affairs to be present Wednesday morning of the convention week in order not to miss any of the good provisions Jehovah has in store for his people.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">was carried out with only handbills being used. No literature was offered for this special activity. Beginning from the Kingdom Hall, publishers worked out as far as possible, in a friendly way inviting householders to see the film.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Initial response to this special advertising seemed good. But what would the results prove to be? We are happy to report that 356 persons saw the film the first evening and 347 the following evening, making a combined attendance of 703. Over three hundred booklets, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief in a New World,</span><span class="font4"> were given out. It was gratifying to note that the vast majority were strangers who never before had attended any meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses. The expressions of attenders on both evenings were of appreciation and thanks for the congregation’s kind consideration in inviting them. Many have returned for other meetings.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Seeing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The New World Society in Action’* Part I</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The New World society is a going concern in all parts of the earth. To show its true magnitude and to enable all of Jehovah’s witnesses to become better acquainted with functions of the organization Jehovah has built up on earth in these last days, the Society sent the film to all countries possible. What are the early results as shown in the 1955 “Yearbook”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Without exception all who see it are thrilled and feel as do the brothers in Northern Rhodesia (223) and Argentina (84). They now have a much better appreciation of the New World society and the theocratic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you were a publisher working with a small congregation and never had an opportunity to attend a large assembly of any kind and had no conception of the work done at headquarters, how would you feel upon seeing the film? Probably as the publishers you read about in Chile feel. (118, 119)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Is seeing the film once sufficient? There is so much to see in it that, as expressed by the Belgium report, “This film can be seen two, three, five or ten times. It never becomes monotonous.” (95, 96) Although the showing of it will not go on indefinitely the Society does wish to arrange for as many brothers and persons of good will as possible to see it. Therefore, it will be shown at all circuit assemblies during the remaining part of the 1955 service year. Do not miss seeing it at your next circuit assembly and be sure to take persons of good will with you. Let them see and hear of Jehovah’s expanding New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Effective Witnessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From house to house Jehovah’s witnesses faithfully go, using Jehovah’s Word skillfully in giving short sermons, in an effort to find and feed the other sheep. Only knowledge and understanding of Jehovah’s purposes will enable people of good will to brace up their minds and join in new-nation activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How much more effective is our witnessing when we use the Bible and give sermons? A small town in South Africa was witnessed to over a year ago. The total of book placements was one. And what resulted recently when Bible sermons were used? Not one, but sixty books were placed before the town was completed. (248)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“What else can we say?” was the reply of the occupants of a home in Fiji after listening to an effective sermon. As you use sermons you will find this to be the reaction of many good-will persons. (88)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sermons are being used world-wide by Jehovah’s witnesses. With interest you will read the reports on Bechuana-land (250) and French Equatorial Africa (76) and see how our brothers are learning how to use sermons in order to become more effective ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Is not a minister expected to give a sermon? Yes, and that is what a householder in Egypt expected on hearing one of Jehovah’s witnesses say he was a minister. He was invited in and the household was called together to listen to his sermon. Such a good sermon was given that the people were deeply impressed. Arrangements were made for return visits. (139, 140)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Are you using the Bible and giving sermons from house to house in order to be most effective in your witnessing?</span></p>

Since </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">is a Bible magazine of outstanding value it is fitting that publishers introduce it by using three- to eightminute Bible sermons. The following sermon, entitled “God’s Purpose,” may be used with good effect.

This information concerns the conditions that we see existing in the world today, in relation to God’s purpose.

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1955 Public Meeting Talks</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">With this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> are three sets of outlines. One set should go in the school library. The other sets are to be used by brothers who are assigned by the congregation committee to prepare talks. Isolated male pioneers will receive a set from the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The titles for public talks in the 1955 series are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. Why the Crisis of All Mankind?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. Communism or Christianity —Which Will It Be?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2">3. Delinquency—What Is Its Remedy?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2">7. God’s Great Healing Program</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">8. Educating Ourselves for Peace and Life</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">These talks may be started on April 10, or as soon thereafter as possible. As of April 1, handbills will be printed for only the 1953, 1954 and 1955 series.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Starting March 6, circuit servants will give the public talk “Chrisa good start. It was only because man sinned that he died. [Gen. 3 :17-19] God did not change his purpose for the earth after man’s rebellion. [Isa. 55:11] However, ‘If it is still God’s purpose for men to receive his blessings for good,’ you may ask, ‘how will It be accomplished?’ Jesus taught his followers to pray for the establishment of God’s kingdom, which would bring his will to pass on earth. Jesus said at Luke 19:10 that one of his purposes in coming to the earth was to ‘seek and to save what was lost.’ Now, what did Adam lose? He lost a beautiful paradise home, the hope of filling the earth with righteous children and the prospects of everlasting life. This Jesus said he came to restore. The Bible promises that these blessings will again exist under God’s kingdom. [Rev. 21: 3, 4] Would you not like to live under such righteous conditions? To do so requires that we study God's Word and learn of the Kingdom arrangement.” Explain how </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> helps them do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Remember to include a copy of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“This Oood News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font4"> with each subscription. If the householder declines your offer of the subscription, which should be made at each door, then endeavor to place a copy of the booklet for a small contribution. This booklet will open the way for many home Bible studies to be started very easily.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">District servants will soon be speaking on “Why a New World Is Possible.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">vertising the showings of “The New World Society in Action” with handbills whenever opportunity is afforded to show the film in your territory. District and circuit servants, as well as others who are showing the film, should keep this in mind when arranging for advertising in conjunction with showing the film.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Legal Notice</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Brothers ordered as conscientious objectors to do work for a private charitable organization should write to Hayden Covington, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York, and ask for Connecticut Opinion. Enclose a self-addressed envelope and return postage. Note that this does not apply to brothers ordered to do work for a state hospital.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YOUR SERVICE</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Starting Bible Studies, Using “This Good New of the Kingdom” Chairman (3 min.) Chairman reviews urgent need for more to feed sheep, as outlined in November “Informant.” New instrument “This Good News of the Kingdom” provided by the Society is especially designed to feed sheep. Using this booklet properly will open up the way to start many more home Bible studies. Observe how theocratic companions use booklet in regular witnessing work and in making return calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (5 min,) Theocratic companions give four-minute sermon and obtain “Watchtower” subscription. Householder is encouraged to read “The Watchtower” and also booklets, particularly “This Good News of the Kingdom”, as arrangements are made to make a return call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (2 min.) Planting done! First step toward aiding sheep accomplished! Watering work now needed, for sheep must be assisted and encouraged to absorb Bible truths. How can this be done? Note how theocratic companions use new booklet on return call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (10 min.) Theocratic companions deliver latest copy of “The Watchtower” and advise householder that subscription copies will soon be coming to him. Having in mind leading into a study of the booklet they channel back-call sermon on Kingdom theme, making points such as: 'Most people know of or have heard Christ's words, “This good hews of the kingdom.” What is the importance of the Kingdom, which is the basic theme of the Bible and for which we pray? Many people desire to know the Bible answer. The booklet “This Good News of the Kingdom” is especially printed to explain and outline what the Bible teaches on this all-important matter.’ At their suggestion householder gets his copy so its value may be demonstrated. Theocratic companions then begin study of material in booklet with householder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (2 mln.) So a study is started. Do not try to cover entire booklet at one time. Subheadings and reaction of householder enable alert conductor to determine how much material to cover. After several studies (none exceeding one hour) study of the booklet is completed. What will the alert publisher now have in mind? Let us watch to see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (3 min.) Benefits of booklet study are briefly summarized and importance of gaining more Bible knowledge is discussed. “Let God Be True” is tactfully introduced and arrangements are made for future visits, to consider material in book as was done with booklet. Householder expresses appreciation and looks forward to future visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (2 min.) Booklet has served its purpose. Study is now to continue in “Let God Be True” or any other publication of the publisher’s choice. Being familiar with contents of new booklet from considering it at the “Watchtower” study, let us wisely use this new provision in feeding the many other sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Using the Magazine</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (3 min.) The “Watchtower” campaign is under way. Realizing the value of this magazine, publishers desire to see it go into every home. What can we do to see this desire fulfilled? Be prepared and participate in the campaign. It has been found by many publishers that the magazine may be very effectively used to obtain new subscriptions by actually placing a copy of the magazine in the householder’s hands after giving a sermon, thus enabling the householder to see for himself the magazine’s contents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (10 min.) Demonstration opens with publisher giving complete sermon (six to seven minutes) which leads into “Watchtower” subscription offer. At completion of sermon publisher, who has two copies of same issue in hand, offers one to householder and invites him to see what “The Watchtower” contains. Publisher opens his copy to first page, saying: “As you open the magazine you will notice that on the inside cover is stated the purpose of the magazine. [Mention a point or two from it.] Then, in the very first article, information is given on ........</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">[very briefly describe its contents]. Next turn to page ........ [give number]</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and here you will find an excellent and timely discussion on ......... You will</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">notice that starting on page ........ there</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">are questions at the bottom of each page. [Explain that their purpose is to help the reader grasp quickly the Biblical points discussed and to understand better and glean gems of truth found in each paragraph.] Another article you will enjoy is this one on page.........</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And now if you turn to the last inside page you will always find 'Questions from Readers.’ This section supplies answers to Bible questions that you have no doubt wondered about yourself. These questions are written in by readers of ‘The Watchtower’ who wish the Bible’s answer to their question. Now this is only one issue of the twenty-four different issues that you will receive, all for a contribution of $1 a year. ‘The Watchtower’ comes to you two times a month through the mail. Also, these three booklets, including ‘This Good News of the Kingdom’, are given free. I have a subscription blank right here and shall be glad to send in your subscription today.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (3 min.) Chairman stresses advantage and effectiveness of using the magazine being offered and placing it in the hands of the householder. Many people do not know what is contained in the pages of “The Watchtower.” The above method is an excellent way to acquaint householders with the magazine’s contents, and, of course, we want all persons of good will to become acquainted with the contents of “The Watchtower” and learn for themselves its real value.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Working with the Circuit Servant</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> The circuit servant’s visit is something that all congregations look forward to with keen interest. And now that the training program has been instituted his visit becomes even more important to each publisher. Why? Because he will have an opportunity to give personal instruction to the more mature publishers, so they, in turn, can be of greater assistance to the others.—Rom. 15:1,2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Since the circuit servant’s visit comes only twice a year all preliminary arrangements should be directed to the end of receiving the greatest possible benefit during the week's activity. Each day's activity is scheduled. Appointments to work with the publishers are made several weeks in advance in order that all available time set aside for training publishers in the field will be well spent. If one publisher fails to fulfill his appointment with the circuit servant, the time that could have been spent training someone in house-to-house preaching will be lost.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Occasionally it is reported that some are hesitant in working with the circuit servant because they do not feel sure of themselves while talking in his presence. This is a natural reaction, just as a speaker has initial nervousness as he begins his public lecture. But this should never cause one to fail in fulfilling one's appointment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Confidently express yourselves in the presence of the circuit servant so that he will be able to observe your presentation of the good news and to offer constructive suggestions for improvement. Then observe his presentation. You will be surprised how much you learn and how quickly any timidity vanishes.</span></p></li>
<li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Everlasting life Is possible! Yet millions will die because they refuse to heed Jehovah's advice: &quot;You must </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">choose life</span><span class="font4"> in order that you may </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">keep alive.”</span><span class="font4"> (Deut. 30: 19, XW) The choice of life must be made now, and then demonstrated by right action.</span></p></li>

Not one! No wonder all of Jehovah’s witnesses want to assist others to choose life by offering the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription and three booklets during February for a contribution of $1.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">January 1, 1955, means that only six and a half months remain before the Society’s chartered steamships depart for the European assemblies. That departure will begin a full month of travel, convention joys and instruction and association with brothers in other lands. It will also begin a tremendous witness to the peoples in the lands where the convention delegates visit. It is gratifying to see brothers throughout the country responding to the invitation to attend the conventions abroad. You will be glad to know reservations on the chartered steamships are still available. Minimum fare is $260. If you are contemplating travel to Europe make your reservation </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">now.</span><span class="font4"> If your congregation does not have a supply, write to EUROPEAN CONVENTIONS, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York, for a reservation form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society is happy to answer any travel questions. Before writing, however, reread the general information letter sent to many congregations. Answers to many questions appear in this letter. Be sure to read the passport Instructions carefully. When filling out reservation forms give the information requested and sign the forms in the spaces provided. All rates for round-trip ocean travel are shown on the reservation form; it is not necessary to remit amounts in excess to those shown. Information on rail trips in Europe will follow at a later date.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> To aid others to choose life requires us to spend time preaching. How many hours do you spend each week in the ministry? Remember: Time spent in service brings results! More service time brings more experiences; more experiences make your ministry more productive; the more productive it is, the more persons you will aid to choose life.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Few people will choose life just because they have a magazine coming to them regularly. We must call back on everyone who shows interest.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> Appreciating the need for all to work together orderly and in unity, the apostle Paul wrote on one occasion : “Let all things take place decently and by arrangement.” (1 Cor. 14:40, VW) Unity and systematic arrangements are very essential if we are to accomplish our work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom efficiently and do our part in gathering the Lord's other sheep. The new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity</span><span class="font4"> will help us to unify and organize our work with greater effectiveness. Each dedicated publisher should become thoroughly acquainted with its contents, so that he may apply the counsel contained therein to the full in his personal ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> After each appointed servant and study conductor has had a chance to read the new booklet the congregation servant should meet with them and discuss the institution and application of the new arrangements in the local congregation, and give counsel and suggestions. This should be within a week or ten days after receipt of the booklet by the congregation. The congregation servant has the responsibility to supervise properly the introduction of the arrangements and counsel contained in the booklet, so that the activities of the cause it is through home Bible studies that people learn how to choose life now so they can live forever.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> All </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Things”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Sister consults Bible study servant for assistance in lining up points that she can use to clear up the subject of the cross for persons of good will with whom a home Bible study has been conducted for several months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4th Week:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Death (page 86 to Eph. 2:1 on page 88)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In house-to-house ministry an unhappy householder is contacted and relates sorrow over recent death of loved one and states that she is confused as to why &quot;God took her loved one.” Alert publisher comforts householder, using “Make Sure of All Things” to show: (1) God’s loving provision for man to live forever, (2) how death resulted and who Is responsible, (3) the condition of the dead, (4) the resurrection hope. Arrangements are made for return call to consider more about resurrection and other related material.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">congregation are in harmony with the booklet and continue to operate smoothly.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Some time on the service meeting (ten to fifteen minutes) should be devoted to studying this booklet at least twice a month and oftener if this can be arranged. Discourses, questions and answers, discussions, etc., may be employed in handling the material. Try to cover eight to ten paragraphs at a time. The publishers should read over the material to be considered and then be sure to bring their copies of the booklet to the meetings. The congregation servant should advise the .publishers when to bring their booklets.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Today the New World society is not only living together in unity; it is preaching together in unity. This is because all dedicated servants recognize that Jehovah is directing his organization and is having the preaching work accomplished according to his will. The most effective ways of reaching the people with the Kingdom message are employed. Counsel and instructions from his theocratic organization help us to work together and preach together in unity. We are, therefore, thankful for the counsel given by the Society in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity </span><span class="font4">and shall follow it faithfully, so that we are most effective in our preaching work.</span></p></li></ul>

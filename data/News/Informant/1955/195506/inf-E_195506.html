<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Shout aloud, you servants of Jah I Here is good news! Here is the answer to the question: &quot;Can we make it 184,763 publishers?” Wb did make it, thanks to Jehovah's blessing upon “Our more than usual good effort.” Tn fact, Jehovah so richly blessed us that we exceeded our goal by 2,357 publishers. We all feel like shouting Hallelujah!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Looking back just a moment, we And that our December report showed a 5.1) per cent increase over last year’s average publishers. It was the best December report on record, but it left us 4.1 pel<sup>-</sup> cent short of our desired 10 per cent increase and with a long way to go to make the 20 per cent increase in April.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> Were Jehovah’s people dismayed or discouraged? No! They saw greater effort was needed, and on learning of the siiecial activity for April all were thrilled! Everywhere publishers reflected the spirit “we can make it&quot; with Jehovah’s blessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> April 3 saw capacity audiences virtually pack out every Kingdom Hall. After hearing the stirring public talk, publishers and good-will persons alike enthusiastically received copies of the new booklet for immediate distribution. Initial booklet supplies melted like a snowball in a tropical sun. Then came April 7, Memorial, and in the United States</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Help New Publishers</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Assemble for instruction ! This was Jehovah’s command to the nation of Israel, and, likewise, Christians are required to meet regularly, “not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together.” (Deut. 31:12: Heb. 10:25) Not only do we meet together for congregation meetings each week, but beginning this month and extending throughout the summer, Jehovah's people will be assembling at conventions In this country and in Europe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> June will provide the opportunity to use a book offer in covering territory. Eor many congregations unalone 244,959 persons of good will attended, and, of these, only 7,735 professed to be of the remnant. What a “great crowd”! Seventy-five per cent of these reported field service. Let us all continue to help these new ones and, too, look after the other 25 per<sup>-</sup> cent not yet going out in the field service from house to house.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> It is gratifying to know that thousands of newly interested persons were helped to begin their first organized service by you devoted servants of Jehovah. By the end of April 3,713,379 booklets were placed. Congregation publishers averaged 17; vacation and regular pioneers, 112; and special pioneers, 149. Excellent ! We had to ship 3,000,000 more copies to replenish supplies. By the end of May all booklets should be distributed. If we do distribute them, it will mean 8,000,000 booklets in homes in the United States.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>6</sup> It was a thrill here in the Brooklyn office to see report after report come in stating “We Made It!” and, on totaling the reports, to find the new all-time peak of 187,120 publishers. A 21.5 per cent increase! Congregations to the number of 1,905 reported they made or exceeded their 20 per cent increase, to compare with 1,220 last year. We feel sure congregations who have not yet made their 20 per cent increase will put forth every efassigned territory work begins. All congregations should make a special effort to cover the rural or city territory that has not been reached in recent months. The offer will be two books and two booklets on a contribution of $1. Place the new booklet wherever possible. Are you prepared with several three- to eight-minute sermons? Are you following up the placements you make with ten- to fifteen-minute sermons? Start the month prepared and work toward the goal of starting at least one home Bible study during June. Also keep in mind the importance of assisting the new publishers that fort to do so before the end of August.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>7</sup> April is now over, but its final results are not. It is recorded in theocratic history as the greatest month yet for those in the United States. It was a month filled with surprises and blessings for all, a month we shall long remember. Since “We made it!” shall we slow down? No! you say. We must continue to praise Jehovah and help all of the thousands who have joined with us, and others too. Therefore, in June and all the months to come, let each of us be active and help new ones we have started to expand their ministry.</span></p></li>

On Mundays spend at least two hours in house-to-house work and an hour or more making back-calls and conducting studies. Throughout the week you will have opportunity to witness and, on your Magazine Day, be sure to participate in magazine distribution. Young publishers and others are encouraged to enter the vacation pioneer service during the summer months. Of course, sharing in all activity means attending meetings regularly and aiding persons of good will to assemble with you. Absorb the good spiritual food provided by Jehovah and unselfishly use the knowledge you have in directing others to Jehovah’s organization for salvation.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6">Magazine Placements Increasing</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society suggests that each publisher endeavor to place at least nine magazines every month and regular pioneers 90 and special pioneers 110. Are you regularly placing this number? The “Yearbook” shows a remarkable increase in magazine placements by publishers in various countries throughout the world. (39, 72) Truly Jehovah’s people more and more are becoming magazine-conscious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Publishers in Puerto Rico have enjoyed a wonderful increase as a result of supporting Magazine Day activity and giving short, to-the-point magazine presentations. Generally, magazines can be presented very effectively in thirty to sixty seconds. Instead of averaging two magazines a publisher a week, they average better than three! (242) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Though Japan is a country filled with shrines and images, “The Watchtower” is doing a wonderful work. (188189) Each publisher placed more than 250 magazines during the year. That is an average of more than twenty a month! Brazil too reports a splendid increase. (100)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the best way to place magazines is from house to house and store to store, other avenues are also open. Five publishers in Guatemala, alert to distribute magazines to bus and train travelers, soon averaged eighty magazines apiece a week. (168) Have you triAd it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By putting into practice the various suggestions contained in this issue of the “Informant,” each publisher throughout the world will meet or exceed the monthly quota of magazines.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">After arrangements have been made as to the list of persons to be written to, then such letters can be written and envelopes made out for mailing the letters and booklets. The letters can be written and dated July 25. 1955, and properly stamped and can then be dropped in the mail any time after July 25. It may be that some of the brothers who will be participating in this work will not be at home during the week following the New York assembly and therefore the suggestion is here made to draw the letters up beforehand so that they can be dropped in the mail any time after the 25th of July.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Sharing Fully in Magazine Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For demonstration, prepare two charts, one showing the total magazines the congregation placed each year for the past five or ten years and another showing the average number of magazines placed per publisher per month during this service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SCENE I (3 min.) Magazine-territory servant talks on importance of placing magazines. Points out features such as current news, always fresh and alive, and wide coverage of subjects. Outstanding is frank, honest appraisal of world events, setting forth Jehovah’s kingdom as real hope of world. So easy to place magazines, all publishers, young and old, may take part. Analysis of activity needed to see how well publishers are sharing in magazine work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SCENE II (8 min.) Congregation magazine charts are pointed to as congregation servant joins magazine-territory servant in examination of congregation’s progress in magazine activity.

Book study conductors can stress Magazine Day, urging all to engage, then taking lead in supporting it; also from service center thirty to sixty minutes before congregation book study time. Publishers must be conscious of need to include magazine activity in their weekly schedule of service. Those not able to meet with group on Magazine Day can use other opportunities, such as a little time before meetings. Children may have magazine routes or work house to house for an hour after school. Mothers might plan to pick up children after school and work with them, thus training them. Housewives might plan an hour or so a week to work with magazines in nearby territory. Many can</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> In recent weeks hundreds of letters have been received requesting changes in travel assignments. Since all travel space is now filled, it will be impossible to make all changes. The Society strongly urges delegates to endeavor to arrange their trips within assigned periods. No further changes can now be accepted; cancellation is the only alternative.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Since this movement is very large and comes at the height of the tourist season, it presents many problems. Delegates should expect certain changes in special train and flight schedules. Major changes are not expected. What the carriers of passengers do is beyond the Society’s control and delegates will just have to accommodate themselves to the circumstances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> It is vital that each person understands that no changes will be made in Europe, so there will be nothing gained in requesting such changes. Further, there will be no refund on unused special train tickets.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6">SCENE III (12 min.) Sister, talking to visiting couple from neighboring congregation, enthusiastically tells how family is working to have fuller part in magazine work. When she cannot participate in regular Magazine Day activity she plans her household chores so she can go out and offer magazines for an hour or so during the week Joyfully she relates the experiences she had in the house-to-house magazine work that very morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As they talk, children come home from magazine work following school Sister explains this is the day children have arranged to work after school Children excitedly tell of magazines placed and interest found. Already they have placed more than nine magazines apiece during the month. Visiting sister feels she too can schedule her housework to do magazine work during week, when unable to go out in day activity, and work with her children after school to help them get started</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Father and son come in and join discussion. Father explains that secular work keeps him from Magazine Day activity, but he has scheduled house-to-house magazine work in early evenings. Results have been good and be is pleased that he now has fuller share in work. Son, who works with his father in the evenings, also enjoys work with group on Magazine Day and tells experience he had working store to store Father is joyful that entire family shares in magazine work and meets goal. Visiting brother appreciates suggestions and concludes he and his family will be able to meet goal by putting ideas into operation in their ministry schedule.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup> Do not be of the frame of mind, “Shall I attend?” but rather, “Which convention shall I attend?” Why should there be any doubt, when Jehovah always provides so amply whenever he invites his people to come together in convention? Accept the bid thankfully and enthusiastically. Be there with the whole family!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> Just think, there were 244,959 Jehovah's witnesses and their good-will companions present at the celebration of Memorial in the United States and Canada, the greatest total ever! What a thrill It would be for all of us, and what a wonderful witness would be accomplished, if all would he present at the several conventions on the North American continent during June and July! Have you completed your plans to attend? And tilled out your Room Request forms and mailed them to the city of your choice? Help others too, that is, those of good will, by arranging car groups to accommodate as many as you can bring. Since we are all eager to see the removal of this old world and the establishment in its entirety of the new, where can we learn more about it than by listening to the Sunday public talk. World Conquest Soon—by God’s Kingdom, to be delivered by the Society’s president. Of course, the entire five days will have programs highly important to true Christians, who are “the light of the world.”</span></p></li>

It is being constructed to produce chiefly one thing: magazines—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and -licofcc/ the two magazines that you are demanding in ever-increasing numbers for distribution. While our present facilities are being taxed to near limit, this new factory will more than treble present production. To be sure, it will adequately supply the magazines we need! We hope that you who attend the New York convention will come to see the construction under way!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">almost 8,000,000, an average increase of well over one million each year? Placements from 1942 to 1949 remained the same, due greatly to the paper shortage created by the war. But with an adequate supply available, in March, 1949, stress was placed on magazine distribution. Magazine Day was started and publishers were counseled: “One day a week will be devoted to the distribution of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">on the streets, from house to house, store to store, and in other ways.” What happened as you responded to this service? The English </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> printing increased from 584,000 copies each issue to 1,513,000</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7">people of good will. To increase distribution farther and to aid more publishers to share in this activity, it is suggested that each publisher place at least nine magazines each month, which averages about two each week and totals over a hundred magazines a year. Is this not a reasonable amount? Regular pioneers, along with circuit and district servants, will have as their goal 90 magazines each month and special pioneers 110. So far this year publishers are averaging 7.3 magazine placements each month, regular pioneers 53.9, special pioneers 00.9, district servants 73 and circuit servants 83. At this rate our magazine placements for 1955 will rise from 1954’s all-time high of 15,382,330 to over 17,000,000! Grand, is it not?</span></p>

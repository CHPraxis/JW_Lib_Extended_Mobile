<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Millions of Copies Already Shipped to the Ends of the Earth</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">February 10, 1955</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My dear Brothers Everywhere,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah's rich blessing is continually being poured out upon his people, and for this we rejoice. All of us are grateful that we have come to know him and his Son and that he has qualified us to be his ministers and to engage in his kingdom service. Our zeal makes us want to do more in true worship in these days of evil tidings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the past month the Society has been printing a new booklet, and by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we hope to have over ten million copies of it ready for distribution beginning April 3, 1955, not only in English, hut in nine other languages. First I should like to say that the message in this booklet is of vital importance and if possible should be placed in every home tor the people to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The world-wide distribution of this new booklet will be started off with a public talk on Sunday, April 3, and every one of us and our people of good will should be in attendance to hear this important lecture. Immediately after the lecture a copy of the new booklet will be given free to each one present to read and study. In addition, after the meeting there will be packages of 20 booklets available for everyone wanting to distribute these new booklets from door to door. You can get a package of 20 booklets for only 10 cents. Later in the month you can get more booklets, because it is our hope that every publisher will place on the average of one booklet a day, or at least 30 booklets for the month of April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is a very important campaign and is one of the biggest the Society has ever arranged for, and if all the publishers will get out into the field and will take those newly interested ones along with them we should have the most wonderful month of witnessing ever experienced on this earth. Remember, the Thursday following is the Memorial of Christ’s death, so let us all be in the field, worshiping Jehovah before and after that date, and help others to do the same. A new peak in publishers is surely in sight world-wide for April, 1955.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here is what we pray will happen, if Jehovah wills, on Sunday, April 3: Thousands of public talks, one in every congregation, and all of us present to hear “Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is ‘the Light of the World’?” Not only in English-speaking congregations but in many other languages all over the world arrangements will have been made for advertising the same public talk. It will be a world-wide proclamation. Share in it by advertising it and being there witli other “sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the new booklet! No, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font5"> campaign does not end. We go right ahead with it, but at every home we place this new booklet for a contribution of 5 cents or even for a penny. If the householders promise to read it and say we may call back, we could even give it to them free. Jehovah loves the poor and needy; so do we. Let us get right at the distribution work by getting our 20 booklets in the hands of the public, and by the next week end, right after the Memorial celebration, we should have disposed of most of our small supply. Talk to 20 people that Memorial week, show them some of the questions answered, anil your 20 booklets will be gone. You will need more booklets before the month is over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the United States we are prepared to distribute five million copies in April. If we do not get them all out in that one month we shall nse the first 15 days in May to work with this booklet alone, nothing else, so that each publisher can place his 30 copies. What a witness will be given to Jehovah's name and how it will comfort those sighing and crying for the truth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">April is a month away. Let all of us be ready to do what our congregation servant tells us to do on April I’lease be at that public meeting and then be a publisher in April. May Jehovah's blessing be on this worldwide witness as his servants go forward, not afraid of evil tidings, but with hearts fixed, trusting in Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With joy I send warm love to all of you from the da&gt; and night workers of Brooklyn Bethel and all the branch offices that are arranging to supply your needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness I am your brother in Christ Jesus,</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">THE GOOD NEWS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>With the New Booklet</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>1</sup> “Outstanding !” you will say as soon as you read the new booklet to be released April 3. You will want to talk about it, telling everyone that here is something extraordinarily special. It is forceful, concise and practical. Its thoughts are fast moving and clear. Questions are answered logically and in such an orderly manner that it will appeal to all kinds of persons, no matter what beliefs they may hold. All should have a copy. It is up to us to see that they do!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> When shall we present the booklet? At every opportunity. We shall offer it to our friends, merchants and neighbors in our day-to-day contact with them. In the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">campaign we shall offer the booklet as part of the three-booklet gift io new subscribers and to those who do not take the subscription, in field service before the congregation book study and on Magazine Day by giving a free booklet with the magazines. What shall we say? The following suggestions may be used word</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Right Kind of Ministers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do the right kind of ministers minister only when conditions are favorable? Do they become easily discouraged, slow down or stop when pressure is brought to bear on them? Most assuredly not, as shown by reports in the 1955 “Yearbook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Eire, a strongly Catholic-dominated country, has been a very difficult place in which to minister. Did Kingdom publishers give up or slow down because of opposition? Not at all! They continued to preach tactfully, and splendid progress has been made. Publishers are now able to give three- to eight-minute sermons and work territory that was almost impossible to work a few years ago. Brothers, are you persistently working your Catholic territory as are those in Eire? (109, 110)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The right kind of ministers in Came-roun did not give up in doing what is right, either. Religious opposition there has now ceased and continual good work on the part of publishers there has resulted in as many as 4,000 attending a public talk. (221)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wherever a right kind of minister might be located he will minister to others. Yes, even though he is alone, as was a brother at a sanatorium in Cyprus. But the right kind of ministers are not alone long, for through their ministry Jehovah gathers the other sheep. There is now a congregation of eight publishers there. (128)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The effectiveness and zeal of the right kind of ministers are so well known in parts of the Gold Coast that five “Reverends” decided it would be useless to stay in a territory being worked by a special pioneer. (159) </span><span class="font5">for word very effectively. Note that they are brief and pointed, just 15 to 30 seconds.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> When you obtain a subscription you may tell the subscriber: “We are giving these three booklets free with the subscription. These two deal with subjects you will enjoy, but I should like to draw your attention especially io the revealing message in this one. Its striking title alone arouses a desire to read it, and when you do, it will capture your interest from the first page to the last. Ten million copies of this booklet are being distributed world-wide during April. I suggest you give it your immediate attention.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> To those who do not take the subscription you may say: “Though you do not feel you can obtain the subscription, I do not want you to miss this excellent booklet. It is extremely thought stimulating. For instance, have you ever considered what it was that caused the ‘dark ages'? On pages 7 and 8 the booklet tells you. [Thumb through the book</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Acting as a Right Kind of Minister </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">New Subscriptions Literally Pouring In</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Start Home Bible Studies</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Actions speak louder than words. /Ind, while the Devil's organization is filled with many talkers, Jehovah's organization is filled with workers. Though they too do much talking, it is their acting that speaks loudest, proving that they are the right kind of ministers.—1 Tim. 4: (i, A'IV.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> By the tens of thousands new subscriptions are pouring into the Brooklyn office from congregations throughout the country. Proper talking and acting as the right kind of ministers from house to house with the use of three- to eight-minute sermons are effective indeed ! Just “How are we doing”? During January 95.-577 new subscriptions were obtained in the United States. How many new subscriptions have you obtained? Bow are you doing? Look at the congre-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">At every opportunity, whether early or late, the right kind of ministers talk of Jehovah’s glory. Brothers in Taiwan start as early as 2 a.m. Preaching from early morning till late evening has enabled them to enjoy a 53 per cent increase m publishers over last year. (192) Surely the right kind of ministers receive Jehovah’s blessing. </span><span class="font5">let.] Here, look at these questions. They are all answered from the Bible. You may have this booklet for a contribution of only 5c or even a penny. It is yours.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> In the evening before the congregation book study we shall present just the booklet. Many new publishers will work with only the booklet even at other times. What we want to do is cover territory, place booklets, and let the booklet do the talking after we are gone. Publishers may memorize and say the following: “Good evening. Here is a copy of the booklet [state title] that was printed for you. For many centuries Christendom has dominated this world and now the world’s fate is bound up with that of Christendom. Just what is the outcome going to be? I am sure you would enjoy reading this booklet, and if you wish to contribute 5c or a few pennies we shall be able to print more for a wider distribution.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> This presentation can be used when working with the booklet alone. Our comments should be brief, so that we place the booklets and keep going. This special booklet work-can be continued through the first two weeks in May, so we can cover more territory. This special six-week distribution should be outstanding!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">gation chart.Did you average at least one subscription a publisher for the first two months?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> While continuing the good house-to-house activity, offering the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription, remember to make return calls and try to start home Bible studies. Many are starting studies in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of of the. Kingdom”.</span><span class="font5"> Have you tried to do so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> By continuing to let our actions speak for themselves during March and the months ahead, it will be our privilege to gather and assist men of good will. That is the blessed reward of being a right kind of minister.</span></p></li></ul>

Stress following </span><span class="font4">points: Publishers should share fully in distribution of new booklet, and should encourage and assist other publishers to have part in April’s great witness. Every publisher, as well as new ones, should preach in April, contributing toward 20 per cent increase. Each congregation book study conductor will diligently help all with his study group who do not report by April 10, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE I (4 min.) Assistant congregation servant gives study conductor list of those not reporting by April 10 and offers </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">suggestions for giving</span><span class="font4"> definite assistance Conductor then calls on publisher listed and enthusiastically talks of new booklet campaign and invites him to share.

Then discuss need for new publishers, in order to reach 20 per cent increase How can many with whom Bible studies are being conducted be assisted to start preaching? All should be invited to public meeting April 2 and Memorial celebration, April 7. Some may hesitate tn take booklets at these meetings or will be unable to attend Here is how</span></p>

Congregations served by circuit servants during this weekwill follow this same arrangement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> And what about congregations attending circuit assemblies? District servants will give the special talk and thereafter announce the name of the new booklet. Put forth a special effort to bring as many good-will persons as possible to the circuit assembly, emphasizing the importance of being present. Those congregations attending assemblies can use the public talk in their cities on Sunday.

Undoubtedly many thousands of good-will persons with whom home Bible studies are being conducted will be privileged to have their first part in the preaching work during April—if we make arrangements to help them. And that we want to do, for preaching is vital if one is to have life in God’s new world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> The new booklet opens a grand avenue for us to invite and assist newly interested persons and thousands with whom Bible studies have been conducted for a length of time to start having a share in Kingdom service during April. And just how are we to do this? Be sure to attend the special service meeting the last of March or the first of April to see how you can share. Undoubtedly this arrangement will assist each congregation to reach its 20 per cent increase in order to report for April &quot;We Made ItWith this new booklet and short testimony anyone who wants to say “Come” can do witness work. Let all publishers who have done any house-to-house work go out alone or in groups and cover much territory with this important message contained in this new booklet.

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Prepare Now to Share Then</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Undoubtedly April, 1955, will be (he greatest month yet for theocratic activity. It may well be an outstanding, never-to-be-forgotten month for the New World society and one that will make a deep and lasting impression upon the old system of things, which is on its way out. The Society’s counsel and advice for all publishers now is simply: Prepare now and share whole-souled in all of April’s activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">- The special public meeting April 3 starts our April activity, but more important, each one will gather to observe the Memorial of Christ’s death at the local Kingdom Hall sometime after 6 p.m. on Thursday, April 7. Appreciating that this is the one celebration all Christians are commanded to keep, none of Jehovah’s witnesses will miss it or be elsewhere. Also, each congregation will make more than the usual effort to invite and assist good-will persons to attend this meeting and the public talk, April 10. Congregation servants will please mail the enclosed Memorial Report card right after the public talk on April 10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Many strangers will be at Kingdom Hall for the first time Memorial night.

Also, rooming committees have been established in assembly cities and Room Request forms are available. Details and prices will automatically be mailed to all who have submitted their reservation requests to the Society for transatlantic transportation. No doubt there are others making their own arrangements for transatlantic travel who will be interested in traveling with the brothers on the rail trips or who may want convention rooming assignments. We urge such persons to request rail-trip information and/or Room Request forms by writing to EUROPEAN CONVENTIONS, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York.</span></p>

The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription offer will be presented, with the new booklet being used, of course. Saturday will be Magazine Day. Every publisher will want to take part in the morning and/or afternoon house-to-house service. So-called “Easter Sunday” will see all publishers engaging in house-to-house preaching with the subscription offer. After such splendid evidences of Jehovah’s blessing upon “holiday” witnessing in November and December, what publisher will hesitate to preach? Surely none! Take newly interested ones with you in the service this special- week end and also at other times. Remember we are . . . </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">. . . Working for a 20 Per Cent Peak</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Can and will we make it? Yes! if each publisher does his part. On totaling the December report the Society was pleased to see that 1.064 congregations in the U.S.A, reported “We Made It I” for a 10 per cent increase.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> But, you might say, if we did not make the 10 per cent increase in December, how can we make 20 per cent in April? Here is how and why. During April all 184,000 publishers who have a card in the congregation files will be encouraged and specially helped to share in April’s witness. Publishers who have not reported by April 10 will be assisted in accord with “Your Service Meeting.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> So there alone is the potential of approximately 184.000 publishers. And how many do we need for the 20 per cent increase? We need 184.763! See the importance of each publisher’s being active in April?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> And where will additional publishers come from? Why, from among the thousands of persons of good will in over 104,000 different homes where Bible studies are being conducted! Many of them will want to enjoy working with you in field service in response to your invitation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Help them to preach.</span><span class="font5"> And thousands, yes, many thousands will want to start preaching by sharing in the distribution of the new booklet. Lovingly, then, take the initiative and help persons with whom you are studying to become Jehovah’s worshipers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup>Then, considering the question again, with each one doing his pari, and with Jehovah’s blessing, is there not every reason to be confident that our 20 per cent goal can and will be reached? We look to all of you to give us the answer.</span></p>

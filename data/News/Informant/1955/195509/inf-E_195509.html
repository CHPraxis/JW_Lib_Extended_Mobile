Yes, tight against wicked spirit forces that try to corrupt the minds of Christian warriors. Victory is assured to those who remain in Jehovah’s camp, set apart for sacred service with minds devoted to holiness.—Deut. 23:14, A W.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Thousands languishing in Satan’s mental prison camps are yet to be set free by the truth. The truth must be taken to them to help them escape, and renewed in our minds to keep us from being taken captive ourselves. How necessary then to use wisely at least two hours of our time every Sunday morning in the house-to-house work, finding enslaved ones and then to follow that with an hour or more making back-calls or conducting home Bible studies, to build up interested ones in the truth ! The literature offer will continue to be any book and booklet for 50 cents.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">New Service Year Prospects</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Things to Have in Mind at Start of Year</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> As we begin the new 1956 service year it is profitable to get a clear perspective of our goals for the year. Our over-all objective is to increase house-to-house witnessing, do it more effectively by using Bible sermons, call back to start home Bible studies and have a greater share in magazine service. This means each individual publisher will have to give more attention to becoming more effective in the ministry and congregations will have to intensify the program for aiding new and irregular publishers to improve. The data set out below will help us see where improvement has been made in 1955 as well as detect where improvement is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> An analysis taken during April and May by the Society shows that 79 per cent of the total publishers share in house-to-house preaching. This is good, but a further analysis</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Servants should take stock of the training program to make sure it is being fully carried out by all. Theocratic companions, with assemblies over, will strive to engage in the service together as much as possible, putting the good things learned at the assemblies into operation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Making back-calls and conducting home Bible studies are a must for every one of Jehovah’s warriors. Engaging in these features of service just “now and then” will not make our ministry successful. As the November, 1954, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font6"> told us, a spot oheck of one area showed only 22 per cent of the brothers made back-calls regularly, and 8 per cent of the publishers conducted studies regularly. A recent cross-section analysis reveals that some progress has been made. The percentage of the brothers now making back-calls each month is 28.3, and 13.5 per cent conduct studies regularly. But are shows that 66 per cent make back-calls : 28 per cent regularly, 38 per cent irregularly; that 34 per cent conduct home Bible studies: 13 per cent regularly, 21 per cent irregularly. Most of the back-calls and home Bible studies are conducted by a few publishers, in comparison with the total. Surely there is a great need for more publishers to feed the sheep through these avenues of service!</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Of the total publishers, 64 per cent participate in the service regularly. This means that 36 per cent do not publish every month, but allow various things to interfere with their service. Each one should be regular and dependable in supporting field service arrangements. Congregations should have definite arrangements to assist irregular publishers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Magazine distribution continues to increase. In 1954 the congregation not these figures entirely too low when we take into account the assistance that could be rendered mentally enslaved people through these avenues of service?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> Be alert to increase your activity in this work and help others to take part in it. Be sure you are one who regularly conducts at least one home Bible study each month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> We must be conscious, too, of our magazine activity. Building our new factory is proof of expansion in the magazine field. However, much greater expansion will be realized when each one of us is magazine-conscious and places his quota of magazines each month. Take full advantage of Magazine Day and every other opportunity to keep the magazines before the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah’s clean worship will triumph in this warfare against Satan’s demonic forces. There is no question of that! The question is, Shall we survive to enjoy the victory? The answer depends on our actions to maintain sanctity now in order to have Jehovah’s blessing upon our theocratic warfare.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">publishers averaged 6.5 magazines a publisher each month. So far this service year each congregation publisher has averaged 7.4 magazines. Pioneers are averaging 54.7 toward their 90-a-month goal and special pioneers 63.1 toward their 110 each month. The analysis shows only 56 per cent share in magazine distribution. Thus only a little over half of all congregation publishers share in magazine activity. Improvement should certainly be made (1) by each publisher’s working to reach and exceed the goal of placing nine magazines each month and (2) by publishers not now sharing in magazine distribution making arrangements to do so regularly. Where necessary, assistance should be given to those not sharing in magazine distribution.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> This analysis provides the basis for all of us to see what has been done and where improvement is needed. As we determine to become more effective and regular in our service to Jehovah we look ahead to more and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued, on page</span><span class="font6"> 2, coZ. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">■with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Return Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Back-calls are a provision Jehovah God has made for his servants to assist godly ones toward deliverance. After placing literature with householders, publishers should be diligent to make return calls and help good-will people “get the sense” of the Kingdom message.—Matt. 13: 19, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A fervent Catholic lady obtained a copy of “Let God Be True”. On reading in it that statues and objects of this kind are nothing but vain idols, she became very cross. She went to her confessor and confessed her sin of having read a book not approved by her religion. What happened? The alert publisher who made the placement made return calls and today the formerly Catholic lady is a regular publisher. (Algeria, p. 150)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Appreciating the need of making return calls a brother, who met witn an accident before he could make a back-call, arranged for another brother to make the call. As a result the good-will person now regularly attends meetings. Was the woman ever contacted before? Yes, but she had waited six years for another call. (Bermuda, p. 75) Do you make your calls promptly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">New publishers early realize the need of making return calls, for it was by being called on themselves that they were assisted toward deliverance. Thus a new publisher in unassigned territory writes: “I should be grateful to you if you could give us the names and addresses of the persons who took publications from you.” (France, p. 148)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When good-will persons move and their new address is known, it should be forwarded to the next congregation. Often it results in experiences like those found on page 201.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Year Prospects (Cont’d) </span><span class="font6">better ministerial service. By the end of December each congregation should have reached a 10 per cent increase in publishers over the average of 1955. Then in April we shall be working for the 20 per cent peak of publishers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> The New World society is everexpanding and we want to advance with it. There is every reason to believe that the 1956 service year, which holds out many prospects for praisers of Jehovah, will prove to be a grand year of increase as Jehovah showers his unlimited blessing upon the faithful ministry of his people.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> The Kingdom message is startling! It is heart-cheering, thrilling, urgent, a matter of life or death! We </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font6"> that.

<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> With a stereotyped introduction that is very businesslike, cold and impersonal, not quite getting down to the real reason for the visit or how the message applies to the householder, only the exceptionally polite ones will listen, and then they may not ‘hear.’ But what householder would not be startled for a second and listen further if you should begin by saying, for example: “Good morning. I am looking for people who are Interested in living forever”? Or what householder would not be pleased if you said: “I have a message for you that is so important that I am delivering it to you personally” ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> But once you have made a personal appeal to the householder, you must follow through and not disappoint him.

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Plan to Attend All Three Days</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> No publisher will want to miss the new circuit assembly program that starts in September. Three days of theocratic counsel containing a variety of wholesome instruction have been planned and arranged. It will be most practical and helpful. All publishers are encouraged to be in attendance from Friday evening through Sunday evening to hear and benefit fully from theentireprogram. Following the baptismal service on Saturday afternoon all congregation servants will want to attend the meeting that has been arranged for them with the district and circuit servants.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> In addition to all publishers’ attending, encouragement and assistance should be given to newly interested persons to attend. In not a few cases good-will persons have come to appreciate greatly their privileges and such phrases and sentences as appear in italics in the two sample introductions below.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> “Good morning. My companion and I are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">calling on you</span><span class="font6"> as a public service this morning. The greatest public problem today is the matter of protection and security. But </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">you have probably said to yourself,</span><span class="font6"> ‘What can I do about it?’ While it is true that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">neither you nor I</span><span class="font6"> can bring world security ourselves, yet we can do something for ourselves and our families, if we know what it is and how. And </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">that is why tee are calling on you this morning.&quot;</span><span class="font6"> [Then go into a sermon on the subject of protection and security.]</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> “Mr.---and I are making some</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">calls </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">on you and your neighbors </span><span class="font6">today to strengthen faith. Many people are losing faith because of the bad conditions they see. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Perhaps you feel a little bewildered and discouraged yourself when you see these things.</span><span class="font6"> And this condition has caused even the United States president to stress the need of keeping strong faith. Faith is needed. Yet faith is not just belief.” [Then go to Hebrews 11:1 for a definition and on into a prepared sermon.]</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> Do not keep the householder guessing, but strike at the heart of the matter at the very beginning and speak to him personally. In that way you will capture his interest and hold it to the end of your sermon.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Also, let all publishers come to the assembly city prepared to share in field service. Some publishers have been a bit negligent in this respect, resulting in assembly cities not receiving the intended thorough witness. One reason for circuit assemblies’ being held at different cities throughout the circuit is for the witness given.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Analyzing Last Year’s Service </span><span class="font4">[For this demonstration an enlarged record card of a model publisher should be drawn up, showing the publisher to average approximately 20 hours each month, at least 10 back-calls and one home Bible study and nine magazines and showing that each month of the year the offer (review past issues of the “Informant” for monthly campaign offers) was placed or quotas were exceeded. Each publisher should have his Publisher’s Record card in hand during theocratic court proceedings.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE I (6 min.) [Theocratic courtroom] Attorney presents charges against individual activity of publishers in congregation. He argues that evidence in Publisher’s Record cards reveals haphazard planning, lack of personal organization, static arrangements for service. Scrutiny of records shows not all are participating whole-souled in advancing true worship. Attorney points to congregation chart and remarks that combined congregation field service results may look good and healthy. However, check of individual minister’s activity presents truer picture of what is actually being done. Christian love and responsibility prompt bringing this matter before theocratic court. Purpose is to examine heart and mind, according to Psalm 26: 1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge remarks that these are serious charges. Asks attorney if he has sufficient evidence to establish proof that publishers are guilty of this negligence. Attorney presents facts, such as: number irregular in service, low-hour publishers, no placements, irregular in back-call and home Bible study service, etc., based on breakdown and analysis of Publisher’s Record cards. Includes attendance at congregation meetings, to compare with potential attendance. Next, requests court to hear chief witness Model Card, so each one in court can examine his own activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE II (12 min.) Model Card called to stand and questioned by attorney. Model Card’s past year’s service activity goes through a complete breakdown, column by column. Attorney cross-examines Model Card, endeavoring to establish firmly in court’s mind reasons for his fine ministerial record. Model Card’s answers include among other things: 1. Spends two hours in house-to-house work each Sunday, with additional hour or more in back-call or home Bible study activity. 2. Supports Magazine Day and works with service center group before study. 3. Conscious of spiritual needs, regular in attending meetings. 4. Organizes personal affairs and plans activity in order to go out as regularly as possible Attorney thanks Model Card and rests case for court’s consideration and action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE Hl (5 min.) Judge deliberates on points brought forth by attorney. Addresses courtroom: Fine progress made by some during past service year. To make advancement manifest even more, all to continue using three-to eight-minute and ten- to fifteenminute sermons, and to improve on these for greater effectiveness in aiding sheep. Reciprocal arrangement, training program should be kept progressive. Example in field must not be set by just one, ten or fifty, but by all associated. Court finds all in need of further improvement. All urged to greater service activity, in compliance with Romans 10: 9, 10 and 2 Corinthians 9: 6-8, NW. Concludes with exhortation for all to maintain sanctity for theocratic warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[This demonstration may be followed by a mature brother’s giving a service talk on “Is Your Best Good Enough?” (“The Watchtower,” January 15,1955)]</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Prestudy Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Chairman (3 min.) Talk on many </span><span class="font4">benefits of working from service center location not only on week ends, during the day and on back-call night but also an hour or so before the congregation book study. Evenings are still long and people are generally quite receptive at this time. Publishers should encourage and help one another to utilize this time profitably to preach the good news as suggested in the following demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SCENE I (6 min.) Two publishers are seated at a table. Brother Companion is saying that he appreciates the help he has just been given in planning a sermon to use in house-to-house work Sunday. Brother Helpful says that he is glad they can work together on their presentations and adds: “Will you be with us for house-to-house magazine work before the congregation book study this week?” Brother Companion is rather negative about it, so Brother Helpful tries to overcome his objections. Included among his objections might be: “I have to rush so when I get home and then I would be too tired to enjoy the study.” Answer that ours is a day for activity and much good can be done by this evening work. Actually the field service will be a refreshing change after the day’s work and will make the publisher alert for the study. “Aren’t people likely to be eating?” Some may be, but the presentation is so brief that none will object. It is a good time to present spiritual food and generally people are most receptive and easy to talk to. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the two are talking Sister Helpful comes in, saying that Mrs. Good Will, with whom she studies, may go along to the book study this week, so she plans to be in magazine work with the group for just half an hour and then pick up Mrs. Good Will on the way to the study. Brother Helpful responds with approval. Brother Companion can see that he has missed out on many blessings, so he plans to go with the group from now on to enjoy prestudy service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SCENE II (5 min.) </span><span class="font4">What are your experiences? This part of the meeting will be open to the congregation to raise their hands and from their seats enthusiastically offer short experiences they have had in evening work, either from house to house or in back-call activity, showing that most people are usually more relaxed and receptive and that this is definitely a good time for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Chairman (2 min.) </span><span class="font4">“Will you be with us?” Briefly summarize the main points and encourage all to share in the prestudy service regularly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Locating New Subscribers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Approximately 5,000 magazines a month are returned by the post office stamped: not found; unclaimed; no such street or number. The Society sends to the congregation a card requesting that the correct address be found. The city servant or congregation servant should see that this is given immediate attention. A prompt call on the person should be made to find out what the difficulty is and what address should be used. Upon ascertaining the correct address return the card immediately to the Society so that magazines can be sent to the subscriber. Publishers have worked hard to obtain these subscriptions and every effort should be made to see that the subscribers get the magazines that carry the vital message of life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Again it is our joyful privilege to prepare for the annual </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font6">campaign. What a wonderful way to acquaint people with the bright outlook of our hope by contrasting this dark old world with the sunny new world by means of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> In 1954 we obtained 138,021 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> The year before, 1953, saw an increase of 25,072 subscriptions over 1952, which was 41,964 over 1951. Year by year the number of subscriptions has been increasing. And what are the prospects for this year? With all publishers spending at least two hours in house-to-house preaching and another hour making back-calls on all </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">five</span><span class="font6"> Sundays of October in addition to midweek service, truly this year should see an all-time peak in new subscriptions.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> As we approach the great crisis of vindication the theocratic requirements for each individual in the New World society come into clearer focus. This can be easily discerned if we compare the theocratic activities of today with those of Jehovah’s witnesses in 1918.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> The same progress that we see in operation in the organization as a whole must be in evidence in each branch of the organization. The “pilgrim” speaker is replaced by district and circuit servants, who are not only speakers but pioneers. The colporteur of the past has developed into the present organization-minded special and general pioneers, and the tractdistributing publisher is replaced by house-to-house ministers, all theocratic companions who co-operate with one another in becoming more proficient ministers so that they may reflect the ever-increasing light of Jehovah’s new world. Thus the path of the righteous leads more and more to the perfect day.—Prov. 4:18.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6">September starts the 1956 service year and the new quota should be placed on the congregation chart. When the August report has been posted, ascertain the average number of publishers each month for the past year and add 10 per cent to this to determine the new quota. Remember, our goal is to reach this 10 per cent average increase by the end of December and then strive for a 20 per cent peak by the end of April. We did well this service year. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, let us do even better during the 1956 service year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">function in the past. This is particularly true of pioneer publishers, whom we are here considering. Each one must meet the theocratic standards of this enlightened pathway.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Today a publisher is required to be dedicated and baptized for at least six months before he is considered for the regular pioneer service. During that six-month period he must have been active in the field service, engaging in all its branches: house-to-house, back-call and home Bible study work. He must be proficient in giving three- to eight-minute sermons at the doors and ten- to fifteen-minute presentations at back-calls. He must average 12 hours, 9 back-calls and at least one home Bible study a month. If he does not qualify in all of these points he is not a mature minister and is not qualified for the full-time ministry representing the New World society and should not be recommended for that branch of the work by the congregation committee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> Publishers who do not co-operate wholly and enthusiastically with the congregation in caring for the Kingdom interests are not qualified for the pioneer service. Publishers who do not see clearly that neutrality in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> to Be Studied</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is suggested that the new publication </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World</span><span class="font6"> be studied at all congregation book studies starting October 1. All publishers and persons of good will will want to attend every study in order not to miss a single portion of this most absorbing publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Back-call: Good-will persons deeply impressed by Scriptural explanation of faith. (John 3: 16, NW) Alert publisher makes use of “Make Sure of All Things” for full and complete discussion of faith.</span></p>

Those who use tobacco are not qualified. Those who are not sound in mind should not be recommended for the pioneer work, because any display of oddity or eccentricities that would detract from the grand preaching work would disqualify one from being a pioneer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> A pioneer must be moderate in his habits, orderly, mild-tempered and apt to teach. He must display loving-kindness in helping interested persons to come to a full knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes and unite in the true worship with him. He must be physically able to devote a minimum of 100 hours a month or 1,200 hours a year to the pioneer ministry, qualified to keep an accurate record and report faithfully at the end of each month to the Society. He must love the pioneer work and recognize it as a divine commission and his service therein as rendered to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> It will therefore be seen that the pioneer service is a job worthy of real men and women who have theocratic stamina and a love for Jehovah, who will not be afraid of evil tidings, men and women whose hearts are fixed, trusting in Jehovah. There are thousands that will qualify; why not join them and enjoy this great privilege of service?</span></p></li></ul>

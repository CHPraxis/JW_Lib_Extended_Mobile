<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> True love is practical! But only by being practiced can it become perfect. Therefore, it is necessary for each of Jehovah's servants to practice true love daily, not only by preaching by word and with the tongtfe, but by displaying love in deed and truth so that his love may be perfect before Jehovah.—1 John 3:18, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span class="font3">II'.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Having this in mind, each of Jehovah’s “little children&quot; will be more than anxious to display his love every day during July by his actions in behalf of true worship. What opportunities will be ours to display true love at the assemblies we attend? Many I We can do this by our consideration of those attending, not being noisy or causing annoying disturbances ; by the keen attention we pay to talks given; by the preaching we do to those we live with and meet in the assembly city and by our all-around, good Christian conduct.

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Mature Publishers Have Responsibility</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> With Jehovah’s blessing, a grand new peak of 1ST,120 publishers was reached in April! A special effort was made by each congregation to see that not only did all publishers participate in the service, but that persons of good will shared in the ministry of praise. What does this mean in the way of responsibility for the servants and more mature brothers in each congregation? It means that these thousands of new preachers of the good news as well as the irregular publishers must receive regular assistance if they are to grow to further maturity and be regular publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> If we were to think of the job of giving this assistance in terms of the great number that should receive help and the amount of time and patience needed to accomplish the job, it would appear beyond our capacity. honor and praise to our God. Also, the information dispensed at the assemblies must be fully taken in so we can put it to use when we return home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Of course, our love is not practiced just at assembly time, but it is an every-day thing. We shall show that love by offering life-giving Bible instruction to the people. The literature offer of one book and one booklet on a contribution of 50c should be presented at every opportunity. Whether we are working in our home territory, in unassigned territory, at the assembly city or traveling to and from the assembly, we shall want to display love by presenting the book and booklet offer to the people. So carry the offer with you and present it on all appropriate occasions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Those magazines that have become such an integral part of our ministry should not be forgotten either. Each of us has a goal of magazine placements to reach. Whether we reach our goal or not depends </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">But look at it from this angle: Almost without exception the new publishers had home Bible studies conducted with them by publishers in the congregation and these same publishers in most cases gave them the necessary assistance to begin sharing in the field service. If each publisher continues to assume this responsibility, which rightly is his, beyond doubt each new publisher will be assisted to continue telling others of the good things he has learned and build up his appreciation for Jehovah’s service. Do not help persons of good will to share in the service for only one month and then let them lapse into inactivity.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> And what about the irregular publishers, many of whom need additional help to be regular praisers of Jehovah? The assistant congregation servant should continue to work </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> This Is the convention month I There is still time for you to make plans to attend one of the &quot;Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> In traveling to conventions you will be able to advertise en route by having bumper signs on your car and by wearing a lapel badge. You can still obtain these from the Society, but you should send your order in immediately. Take literature too, and place some here and there with those -with whom you talk.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Traveling, attending, sharing the joys of assembling together, will enthuse all to greater activity in serving the Most High, which is the desire of every dedicated servant. Attending one of the conventions will help you to grow in maturity. The program is one that will help us all in our spiritual needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The president and the vice-president of the Society along with others will be at every one of the convention cities. Be sure to attend one of this year’s &quot;Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>To All Conventioners Staying in Private Homes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses attending one or more of the eleven conventions will be housed in private homes. In addition to witnessing to householders during your stay and thanking them when leaving the convention city for their hospitality, it would be well to write a short letter of thanks upon arriving home. Many householders go to much trouble and expense preparing rooms, purchasing linen, etc., to care for conventioners. A short letter would be appreciated by them and give opportunity for us to express our thanks further. Additionally, it may open the way for convention-city publishers who will call on all who housed delegates to give an additional witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Many householders have become acquainted with Jehovah’s witnesses through the convention activities and today are Kingdom publishers. Would you not like the following results to be forthcoming for the person in whose home you stay? “Dear Brothers: [this letter to the Society starts] Three years ago when one of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 4, col. 1}</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Assemblies, both circuit and district, are of vital importance to all of Jehovah’s witnesses. Attending assemblies results in so many blessings for each individual publisher that whatever effort might be required to attend is not considered too great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But assemblies are not just a source of blessing to mature publishers’ They are the means of assisting others to see and appreciate the truth. Two young men in the Bahamas well appreciate the value of assemblies now and will be diligent to assist and encourage others to attend. (94)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Long before conventioners start arriving at assembly cities the local brothers spend days and weeks making necessary preparations. A big thing is rooming accommodations. Not only is it more economical to stay at a private home, but much good can be done there by alert, tactful publishers. (95)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sometimes assembly halls are easily obtained in good condition, but this is not always the case. Much work must sometimes be done to put the halls in good, usable shape. An example of what brothers can accomplish and the effect their efforts have upon people in the communitv is given in Brazil’s report. (101)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Assemblies are properly looked to as a favorable time to symbolize one’s dedication. A couple of the many interesting baptisms are found on pages 76 and 194. Are you contemplating taking this step at the next assembly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Local people take note of conventioners’ Christian conduct and are deeply impressed. How much? The day following an assembly in Yugoslavia a woman who had been one of the greatest opposers of Jehovah’s witnesses asked for someone to call on her. Be conscious of your conduct at assemblies. (271)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Truly, assemblies, district and circuit, are a source of blessing to Jehovah’s people and good-will persons.</span></p>

Book study conductors, what do you do with the lists of those who have not published during the month? Do you accept your responsibility to see that all are called on and offered the necessary assistance to be active praisers? Do you make definite arrangements for them to go with you in the service whenever possible? or do you just limit your help to a few words of encouragement when you see them? If you are unable to call on all yourselves, do you arrange for other mature publishers in your group to call and give assistance and encouragement? One of your most important duties is to assist all associated with your service center to be regular in the service and to become more and more effective preachers of the good news.—Acts 20</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">: 28, iVW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> This assistance will be gladly given if servants and publishers show proper love for the Lord’s “other sheep,” who are now being gathered. Show your love by your works in their behalf. If you do, you will find</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The date of the first departure for Europe is rapidly approaching. Many brothers will be leaving from Quebec city on July 14, 1955, aboard the chartered steamships. Two special trains are arranged to carry passengers who desire the service directly to shipside. One train is scheduled to depart from Grand Central Terminal, New York city, 8 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time), July 13, 1955. No special tickets are required; just be sure when you purchase your rail ticket that it is routed by way of the New York Central, Delaware and Hudson, and Canadian Pacific. Another special train is due to depart from Central Station, Montreal, 10 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time), July 14, 1955. Tickets for this train should be routed over the Canadian National Railroad. Both trains will take passengers to shipside. These will be the last trains to arrive in</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Telephone Listings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup>As the mushroomlike growth of Jehovah’s organization continues the need becomes more acute for persons of good will to be able to locate Kingdom Halls. Many inquiries for Kingdom Hall addresses are received at the Brooklyn office from people of good will who have read literature, know one of Jehovah's witnesses in another town, or have some other contact and desire to attend congregation meetings. With Jehovah’s witnesses’ continually being in the news, items in the press may stir the curiosity of some and they may wish to locate the congregation. Others may wish to contact Jehovah’s witnesses to conduct funeral services, have questions answered, etc. Also, when traveling or vacationing in another city brothers may desire to attend meetings. How can Jehovah’s witnesses be contacted if the Kingdom Hall addresses are unknown and the congregation does not have a telephone?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> In order to fill this need a number of congregations who do not have a telephone at the Kingdom Hall have taken advantage of the opportunity to use an additional telephone directory listing. The congregation servant (or member of committee) having a telephone at his residence also lists it under the name “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” This additional listing in the alphabetical directory may be secured for a small charge by calling the business office of the local telephone company. Also, some congregations w’ho have a telephone at the Kingdom Hall have an alternate call listing (the residential number of the congregation servant or member of the committee), since generally no time for the sailings. It is not required that ship passengers take the trains; the trains are arranged for the convenience of those who travel by that means.</span></p></li>

Tickets for travel between Nuremberg and Bremerhaven (for “Arosa Kulm” passengers) and between Stockholm and Gothenburg (for “Arosa Star” passengers) will be sold on the respective ships. No special trains are arranged for travel between Stockholm and Amsterdam.</span></p></li>

Observe following demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (3 min.) Publishers have worked their isolated territory and have a number of back-calls lined up where interest has been manifested. They do not want to leave territory without something definitely established as a result of their efforts. They want to organize those of good will so that they can carry on by themselves. These publishers talk over possible homes that would be good to use for organizing a group. They discuss idea of having a 45-minute public talk at a home, followed by a short 15- to 30-minute Bible study, to get new ones started studying. Several good-will persons seem to be likely prospects for going right on to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (8 min.) Brother calls on home where he had started private study and where a considerable amount of interest makes this a most likely home for this meeting. He explains that his work in the area must soon come to an end and that he desires to gather together all who are interested in the Bible, such as they, and have a talk, followed by demonstration of best way to study Bible. He explains advantage of having group in community who </span><span class="font3">one is at the Kingdom Hall to answer calls except during meeting hours.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Brothers should not conclude from this article that the Society wants congregations to go to the expense of putting a telephone in the Kingdom Hall. Rather, it is to make known the telephone company’s alternate listing arrangement should any desire to take advantage of it. It is suggested congregations use the name “Jehovah’s Witnesses” in listing telephone numbers. flight time. Further details will be provided air passengers when tickets are delivered.</span></p></li></ul>

One offers excuse he will be unable to attend, so “Watchtower’' subscription is placed with him so he will have communication with Society. Two other persons, after matter is well explained to them by publishers, agree to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE IV (8 min.) Scene opens with public talk just ending and chairman explaining to group the advantage and necessity of regular group study of Bible. He then starts model study in “Let God Be True’’. Scene then flashes to end of study. Brother explains that they can carry on with study very easily and suggests that the man at this home conduct the study. Then brother says he will write to them and visit them once a month or whenever possible. He also describes the provision made for the circuit servant to visit them when the circuit servant serves the nearby congregation. Good-will persons express appreciation for arrangements and agree to carry on as well as they can, confident God’s blessing will be upon their efforts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> August concludes the service year. Will your congregation average a 10 per cent increase for the year? Let all be active in August and assist new ones. Also, remember to mail your report to the congregation should you be away at the end of the month.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> For many young publishers August is the final month of vacation. Young ministers, use the month wisely by spending the maximum time you can in field work. It will be the last month of vacation pioneering for many, while for others it will be the start of their pioneer service. To be sure, many will take to heart the assembly admonition and make adjustments in order to pioneer. Will you be one of them? This is one of the best ways you can show that you recognize Jehovah’s arrangements and can aid others to recognize the theocratic organization for life.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Persons of good will desiring and anticipating salvation in this day of judgment should consider this subject of baptism now. Baptism and that which baptism pictures were essential to salvation in the former judgment periods of Jehovah's people.—1 Pet. 3: 21; 1 Cor. 10:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Today we are living in the greatest judgment day of all times. What consideration are we required to give to baptism today? Baptism in water, made in the presence of witnesses, shows to others that you recognize yourself a sinner and that henceforth you are going to do the will of Jehovah God as exemplified and commanded by Christ Jesus.—Ps.'40:7, 8; Mic. 4:1-5 ; Luke 9: 23 ; 1 Pet. 2: 21; 4:1-3, A’W.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The covering cherub publicly repudiated Jehovah. Our first parents similarly repudiated Jehovah. For this they were condemned and cast out of Jehovah’s holy family. All the offspring of our first parents came into existence in this condemned state. The Devil would have you believe that the question is whether you are good enough to dedicate your life to Jehovah God or not. No one of Adam’s family is that good. (Rom. 3: 1-12, I'll') The issues are: Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of Jehovah God and his righteous ways, or on the side of the rebel, Satan the Devil? If you are on Jeho-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">vah’s side, are you prepared to take your stand for Jehovah publicly and manifest it before all by dedication and baptism? This decision must be made now and quickly, because we are approaching the climax of this judgment day: Armageddon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Some disquieting facts are revealed in the analysis of the congregations’ reports. There are many thousands of publishers who engage in the Kingdom service in the United States who have not been baptized. Some are newly interested ones; others are children. But after making allowance for these, there are still thousands of adults who should be giving serious consideration to this subject now who apparently are not doing so. Presumably they see the issue and are at the point where they should declare themselves In this great crisis. Remember, it is necessary to become a follower of Christ by dedication and baptism in order to be in the way of preservation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> These facts should be called to the attention of the congregation, that all may seriously consider the matter and examine themselves. None, of course, should be baptized unless they are dedicated to Jehovah God. None should dedicate themselves until they count the cost and decide that they are prepared to meet the issue on Jehovah’s side. But. having seen the issue and made their dedication, then they should declare themselves before witnesses by being baptized.</span></p></li></ul>

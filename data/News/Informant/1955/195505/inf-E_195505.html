<p><span class="font4">'Ou Siimlaj, April 3, over •5,600,000 new booklets were in U.S.A. Kingdom Halls awaiting release. By Memorial, April 7, virtually all were placed with publishers and good-will persons for distribution. Starting April 4, and growing day by day, a flood of orders from all over the country requested “more copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom, or Christianity—Which One Is ‘the Light of the World’?”</span><span class="font4"> On Saturday morning, April 9, nearby congregations carried away 60,000 copies direct from the factory. The 800,000 on hand at Brooklyn with which to fill orders have melted to nothing as this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> goes to print. But, by Jehovah's undeserved kindness, there will be no shortage! Additional booklets by the tens of thousands are rolling off the presses day and night and being shipped to you as rapidly as your orders are received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> What is happening to all these booklets? Are they being placed? To ascertain this the. Society wrote various congregations scattered from Maine to California, and from Florida to Washington, for a special publisher-booklet report. Note some of the reports.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Those are just a few samples. The entire cross-section analysis shows publishers to have averaged 16.3 booklets the first seven days. Over two a day I At that rate, based on the number of publishers reporting for March, well over 2,000,000 booklets were placed during the first seven days. Large and small congregations alike write: “Booklets rapidly being placed, and we're just getting started ! Send more !“ Little wonder our presses are again running day and night. Keep up the gooil work, brothers, for the Society can, and will, print all I he booklets you can use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">' During the rest of April and May cover all your territory that has not been served with the booklet. Tt is important that everyone be given an opportunity to have a copy. If more are needed, order them ! However, order only what can be used in April and May. Any order bearing an April postmark will be charged at the reduced rate. And remember, starting May 1 use only the booklet with 15- to 30-second presentations until all jour territory is covered or your booklets are all placed. All publishers should be diligent to distribute all booklets they have so that by the end of May every booklet will be where it belongs—in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The special report also reveals that many new publishers have started in the ministry. One congregation reports 23 pew publishers by April 10. Several others made their 20 per cent increase, with one already reporting a 65 per cent increase. Have you been out? How about the persons with whom you study? Utilize the few remaining days of April to help them start preaching “for the purpose of a witness.” Then continue helping them in May and the months to come. In March 163,843 publishers reported. That is the largest number this service year! With all these publishers out in April and the new ones reporting, can we make it 184,763 for the 20 per cent?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> And how is the booklet work affecting the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch-tou'er</span><span class="font4"> campaign? Splendidly! In New York city, in the first ten days, 4,823 publishers reported 1,538 new subscriptions and 57,859 booklets. This indicates that the booklet work has not slowed down the subscription work, but. rather, has stimulated it. April may well be the best subscription month of the campaign. Follow up all subscription prospects the few remaining days of April ami the first ten days of May with the special offer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> We know you are looking forward to the results of April's activity just as we are. But April is not ovei yet! Spend as much time as you possibly can in the service the few remaining days and help any who have not yet been out. Help them out In May again too. Turn in full and complete reports to the congregation promptly at the end of the month. While we are bus,\ printing more booklets now, at the end of April we shall be looking forward to receiving your congregation report with a “We made italong with other all-time highs in every column of the report, as the result of Jehovah’s blessing upon your more than usual good effort to do his good pleasure!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> During April congregations all over the country reached new publisher peaks as thousands, recognizing Jehovah’s arrangement, began sharing in the preaching work for the first time. Can we maintain these peaks? Yes! if we all do our part. How? By mature publishers' helping these ne.w ones to keep walking the road to life. They need you ! If one you have studied with published for the first time during April, continue to lead him in field service.

<p><span class="font4">In ordering the European Convention Rail Trips a number have asked on what dates the Package Trips will operate. The Package Trips are only combinations of the single journeys. Hence, P-1 combines Trips A, B and E: P-2 combines Trips A, B and F; P-3 combines Trips A, C and E; P-4 combines Trips A, (.'■ and F; and P-5 combines Trips A, D1 and E. The dates applicable to the single journeys also apply’ to the Package Trips. Those desiring the trips are urged to submit their orders as soon as possible. No rail tickets for the trips will be sold in Europe; all arrangements must be completed before departure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to a last-minute rush for transatlantic travel and the limited supply of space, no further applications or changes for transatlantic travel should be sent in to the Society, as we have no more space available. It is fully realized that those who submitted requests from March 1 till now and who have not yet received a reply are anxious to know if the Society's arrangements will accommodate them. Every effort is being made to give such requests early attention. If such ones can be accommodated, however, the space available may not be exactly what is desired. But do not write for any more space.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> How often have you tried to witness to people who feel content in their religion and confident that they are doing all that is necessary? Of course, they are mistaken, and if they are to gain life they must begin to do something that they do not realize is necessary, namely, to ‘take in accurate knowledge.’ (John IT: 3, ,VU’) How can they be convinced, tactfully? Why not try the following in reply to the householder's comment: “If I live up to what I believe that is all that is necessary&quot;?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> “You have the right idea in saying that you must live up to what you believe. Just saying you believe something is not enough. Note what it says here at Janies 2:18 to 20. [Read.] This probably calls to your mind the case of the rich young ruler. [Paraphrase Luke 18:18-24.] But in order to do right works apd to do the work that Jesus did, we must have right information. Note what the apostle Paul said, at Romans 10:2 and 3. about those who didn’t have right information. [Read.] There are many people that have a zeal for God, even in heathendom. but they do not know Christ, and because they do not accept what God has provided they can never be saved, as Acts 4:12 tells us. [Read.] Not wanting to be of that class, we want to be</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Monday, May 30, a holiday in most parts of the country, is being set aside for special magazine activity. Congregation servants should immediately ascertain their needs, then fill out and return the enclosed magazine order blank before May 10. House-to-house magazine work should be planned and all should arrange to share fully in this special work. Last December over 200,OIK) extra magazines were ordered for the special Magazine Day and thousands of brothers joyfully reported splendid results.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">•’■Or. if the householder implies that he is doing all that is required, by saying, &quot;I follow the golden rule,&quot; you might try the following in reply : &quot;Yes, the golden rule of neighbor love is important. So much so, in fact, that Jesus regarded it as the second-greatest commandment. And we can see why it is so important when we read 1 John 4:20. | Read. | But while we love our neighbors, we must not forget the commandment of first importance, love for God. [Read Matt. 22:37,38.] And the first step in showing love for God is to learn as much about him as we possibly can and exactly what it is that pleases him. [Read 1 Tim. 2:4.] That is the very purpose of this publication. . . .’’ (Additional good points that may be used are found on pages 124 and 125 of the February 15, 1955. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> At the beginning of your refutation it is best not to bring up the point on which you disagree, but rather the aspect of the matter on which you agree.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> “A faithful man shall abound with blessings.&quot; (I’rov. 28:20) How true that is! Jehovah's willing servants have found this to be so. To the extent that they have applied themselves to Jehovah's service, to that extent have their blessings abounded. And especially has this been so with those who have faithfully heeded the call to engage in full-time ministry—the pioneer work —whether regular or vacation, according to their circumstances. All these have increased in maturity and have become more able and qualified ministers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> It is a joy here in the office to read many letters of appreciation from congregation publishers who have digested the fine article in the March 1, 1955, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> “Is the Full-Time Ministry for You?&quot; Along with many of the letters is an application for regular pioneer service or a request for an application. One such letter reads : “Having just read the article on pioneering in the March 1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watehtoicer, I</span><span class="font4"> feel that no longer should I put off doing what I’ve wanted to do for a long time.&quot; Have you read the article and given it due consideration?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">ment and arrangements made for back-call, which follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(20 min.) </span><span class="font3">Publisher tactfully channels discussion to original subject, that God’s Word offers hope for everlasting life, and Bible truths and doctrines, such as that of God’s kingdom, which is the main theme of the Bible, must be understood. Publisher then goes into ten- to fifteen-minute-back-call sermon outlined above. On concluding sermon publisher refers to “This Good News of the Kingdom”, which contains fundamental Kingdom information and is being translated and distributed world-wide to aid in work predicted at Matthew 24- 14 Pertinent questions in first paragraph show importance of subject. Paragraph is read and briefly discussed. Attention is then directed to questions on paragraph two. Householder is invited to read paragraph and then questions are discussed. Then questions on paragraphs three and four are read and discussed. Feeling he has stayed long enough for first call, publisher then says, “I have to leave now, but I enjoyed discussing these things with you very much and as I shall be in the neighborhood again this time next week I should like to call back and talk with you further about these things ” Arrangements are made accordingly and suggestion given that householder read ahead in booklet and look up the scriptures in his own Bible for next discussion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(2 min.) Conductor sums up demonstration, calling attention to the benefits of preparedness from beginning to end and possible results from similarly following up each placement of new booklet. As a suggestion, publishers may copy or cut out above outlines and carry them in their Bibles for reference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Vacation Pioneering</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> For all publishers with Scriptural obligations that now make regular pioneer service out of reach, why not be a vacation pioneer one or two months, or even for two weeks? Now is the time to start making your pioneer plans. Many brothers and sisters look forward to yearly vacation pioneering until being able to become regular pioneers. And more and more are engaging in this blessed privilege of service year by year, as shown in the chart below.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1948 — 797 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1952 — 1807</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1950 — 858 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1954 — 4389</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a few</span><span class="font4"> who have enjoyed this service are now regular or special pioneers, Gilead graduates or circuit servants, and enjoy other fine privileges of service.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Do you want to abound in blessings? Do you desire to increase in mature service and become a more qualified minister? Do you wish to have a greater part in singing songs of praise to Jehovah’s name and aiding the other sheep in the way that leads to life in the new world? Then arrange to enter the pioneer service. If you cannot be a regular pioneer, then be a vacation pioneer during a period when circumstances will permit. See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Vnitg</span><span class="font4"> (paragraphs 58-69) for</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Godly Ones Toward Deliverance</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every day each one of Jehovah’s witnesses seeks opportunity to help others toward deliverance. The 1955 “Yearbook” contains many interesting<sup>-</sup>reports of what has been done by God’s faithful servants. Just how seriously do Jehovah’s witnesses take their ministry? The missionary report from Liberia, is most interesting<sup>-</sup> in this regard. (204)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brothers serving aboard the Society's boat “Faith” are privileged to help many persons in remote areas. On the island of Carriacou the priest does not appreciate the efforts of our brothers to help godly ones toward deliverance, as you will read on page 266. A brief account of their service during 1954 is given on pages 79-81.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even under adverse conditions Jehovah’s ministers are often able to help godly ones toward deliverance A brother in Greece was arrested and taken to the police station. He gave such a good witness that one of the policemen later called on the brother at his home to obtain some literature. (163)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Much counsel has been given to us on the need of witnessing tactfully to those opposed and of answering their harsh words and threats with kindness. A special pioneer in El Salvador has done this and now is privileged to help many persons, formerly opposed, toward deliverance. (142)</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Book Placements Increasing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">We must learn to live! Not in the ways man decrees, but as Jehovah (lod ordains it! It would be folly on our part to follow a course other than that outlined by God. Safeguarding what we most desire means making it our business to meet regularly with ones of like precious faith : &quot;Not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together.&quot;—Heb. 10:25, A'lF.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We shall continue to offer two books and two booklets on a $1 contribution in June, covering neglected city and rural territory. How are we lining placing books? Past campaigns reveal good results. In 1953 an average of 136,412 publishers, within a two-month period, placed 402,150 books. Did we do as well in 1954?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Magazine Placements</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> How are you getting along in placing at least nine magazines each month? That is the minimum number each publisher should strive io place every month. With eight months of the service year completed at the end of April, each publisher should have reported at least 72 magazines. It is suggested that congregation servants analyze Publisher’s Kecord cards the first part of May and advise the congregation of its standing, along with suggestions for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Do you have a sufficient supply of magazines? At the end of April (he </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaign ends, but tins is no reason for reducing 1he number of distributors’ copies, if the publishers will put them out. Continue placing magazines! Check with all publishers right away to determine how many copies of each issue the congregation can use and then submit a magazine order blank io the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Itemember, any day of the week can be used by the congregation as Magazine Day. And what if a publisher cannot support regular Magazine Day service? If this is the case lie can do magazine work some other day, with the exception of Sunday, which all publishers should set aside to work from house to house with the monthly offer and then make back-calls. Housewives and others who can arrange an hour here and there may profitably do magazine work in their own neighborhood as they have opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> With each publisher distributing at least nine magazines each month the two most important magazines on earth will continue to reach and feed countless people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yes: 158,801 publishers left 477,248 books in the homes of persons of good will. What shall we do in 1955? Basing conclusions on the facts that &lt;&nbsp;11 we have more publishers now than before and (2) the training program benefits are definitely being realized with many more using effective three- to eight-minute sermons, we should exceed what was accomplished in previous years.</span></p>

Keep an accurate record of the time you spend in preaching and if you are not at borne at tile end of the month, send your report to your congregation servant, so he can arrange to have the complete congregation report compiled and submitted to the Society.</span></p>

It is tin ever-increasing function, and particularly at convention time, when it is accomplished on a widespread basis, because it magnifies and enhances the name of Jehovah and brings joy to all of God’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">- Of course you are making plans to attend one of the large conventions in this country, and many will be planning to attend the European conventions too. So you will want to plan to share in advertising before reaching the convention city and while there.</span></p>

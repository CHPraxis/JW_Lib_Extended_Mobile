<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Our humble and loyal recognition of the theocratic organization means zealous action, faithful submission and co-operation with it. In turn, this results in our being fully fed, satisfied and being granted blessed privileges of service. What a happy, gratifying relationship! And it leads to life!—1 Sam. 2: 30, AS.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> August brings to a close the 1955 service year. Bend every effort to make it a well-rounded-out month of theocratic service. For many it will be the concluding month of vacation pioneering and the last month of summer vacation. Make good use of the time by spending the maximum of it serving Jehovah. An avenue of service for all this month will be regular participation in house-to-house work, offering on a 50c contribution</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Wise Distribution of Literature</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Use Literature Discreetly</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Lovingly Jehovah provides his servants with Bible literature to use in conjunction with their ministry. It is our responsibility to distribute it wisely and in a uniform manner so that the best results may be attained in the preaching work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The literature that we present to the people should be clean, unused and, in the case of magazines, current. If we offer literature that is dog-eared, frayed or dirty, an unfavorable reflection is cast upon the message and the preaching activity. Let the literature you carry be a praise to Jehovah and demonstrate the cleanliness of his servants.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> The Society makes the arrangement for books, booklets and magazines to be placed with people on a cost basis. The contribution asked is so small that most persons can easily afford to give the amount suggested. By contributing for the literature people are inclined to put a higher value on it than they do if it is given free. If, however, you find sincere, honest-hearted people who a book and a booklet. Congregations will see that all associated ones, including new publishers, are helped to preach and advance toward maturity as qualified ministers.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> The “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies will be past for most publishers, but not the fond recollections. It should be a memorable event, truly a wonderful occasion. A bountiful feast spread with instruction and counsel! How much richer spiritually all who attended should be! For the benefit of those who did not get to attend, and for a refreshing reminder to all who did, it is suggested that congregations arrange to devote some service meeting time to discussing convention activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> The remaining long summer evenings are an excellent time to do magazine work for an hour or more from service centers before congre-are eager to read the literature, but are really too poor to give even a small contribution, then, of course, exceptions may be made. Generally speaking, tracts are what Kingdom publishers will give free to people manifesting some interest and they should be carried for that purpose. Always carry tracts with you and use them when the opportunity arises.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> When calling at people’s homes or while you are doing magazine street work it is better to offer the books, booklets and magazines and mention the contribution they can make toward our work than to give literature away free to the people. In some cases it has been found when brothers have indiscriminately given literature to people, other brothers working the territory later properly presenting and asking a contribution for the literature have been told by householders, “I’ve always been given the literature free before.” This, of course, results in confusion. Also, some religious organizations encour-</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, col.</span><span class="font2"> 2) gation book studies. Use thirty- to sixty-second presentations when making the magazine offer. Reports continue to pour in relating the success had in this work and numerous joyous experiences publishers have engaging in this service just before the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> All who recognize and submit to theocratic organization will work unselfishly to help others find the way to please Jehovah and thus gain life and happiness. These will co-operate by serving the truth to others at every opportunity, from door to door, before congregation book studies, through back-calls and home Bible </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font2"> 2, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">col. 1)</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>A CAUSE FOR CONCERN</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Why has the number of pioneers been dropping steadily? What has caused and is causing the number of pioneers to drop continually while the number of congregation publishers climbs steadily? Look at the pioneer figures.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark10"><span class="font1">Vacation Regular Special 1954 1955 &nbsp;1954 1955 &nbsp;1954</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font2">A goodly number are enjoying the work! Why do not more of you have this pleasure? Are old-world interests more attractive? They will not pay. Pioneering is still one of the most honorable and worthwhile .works on earth today. Surely many thousands could be active in pioneer service, and yet are not. Why? Pioneering is for everyone, the anointed and the other sheep class. If you can possibly arrange to be in this service, do not put it off, thinking it is for someone else. It is for you! If you qualify for the pioneer service, write for an application. Start pioneering now!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Special Booklet Report</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">All congregations and isolated publishers should report on their August monthly report card how many clergymen were mailed copies of the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity —Which One Is “the Light of the World”?</span><span class="font2"> and how many copies were sent to editors of periodicals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Working Isolated Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah’s witnesses are eager to preach ‘this good news of the Kingdom in all the inhabited earth in fulfillment of Matthew 24:14 (NW) and thus rejoice to serve people living in unassigned territory as well as those living within the bounds of their assigned territory. As in previous years, many of the other sheep living in unassigned territory will be located by publishers and they will respond to the Kingdom message. (270)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to making new contacts in unassigned territory many publishers will be returning to territory previously worked. In these cases every effort should be made to render further assistance to good-will persons previously contacted. Most likely you will be received as were publishers in Alaska. (74)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Within the last year and a half the Society has directed special pioneers into many unassigned territories in the U. S. A. and other countries. The results may well be illustrated from the report from Colombia, where three new special pioneers organized a congregation and within a year there were twenty publishers and a new local pioneer. (123)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Unusual conditions in various parts of the world sometimes make it quite difficult to reach unassigned territory. But to exert the effort to reach and work the territory brings most gratifying results, as you can read on pages 219 and 220. A witch doctor becomes a Kingdom publisher, a public talk draws 293 persons, more than twenty new con-gregationsareenrolled and many scores of groups of isolated personsareformed. Read, too, the most unusual experience of finding a lost congregation of sheep.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Literature Inventory</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Two Literature Inventory forms are being sent to each congregation with this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> An actual-count inventory of literature is to be taken on September 1 and recorded on these forms accurately and completely. All pioneers associated with congregations will take a count of their literature and turn in to the congregation literature servant a signed slip showing how many books and 32- and 64-page booklets they have. The total for all pioneers associated with the congregation will be shown at the bottom of the Literature Inventory form. The congregation servant should check with the literature servant to see that the inventory is properly taken and give him help if necessary. Send the original to the Society not later than September 3 and retain the duplicate for your files. The results of this Inventory and the latest statement of the congregation’s standing with the Society should be read to the congregation.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Variety is the spice of life! Sameness produces monotony and monotony is unnatural as well as uninteresting. On the other hand, the handiwork of Jehovah is ever fresh and new because of its variety. The alert theocratic minister will make his Bible sermons live by following this same principle in presenting the good news from house to house.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Using a variety of three- to eightminute Bible sermons will enable you to put more warmth, feeling and enthusiasm into your discussions at the doors and you will not grow tired of what you say because of repeating the same sermon or become stereotyped or mechanical. Also, it will help you fix many different scriptures in your mind that you can recall in future discussions, and make you more familiar with God’s Word.</span></p></li>

Even when the territory Is covered often, if your sermons change along with the offers it will be like working the territory for the first time.

<p><span class="font1">Part I (16 min.) Two brothers will summarize the program of the assembly they attended, one talking on the first three days and the other, the last tw<sup>T</sup>o days. These talks should deal with points made in the discourses at the assembly, showing the need of applying the information in our ministry and personal lives. The publications released can be displayed and their future usefulness in the ministry briefly explained. Such things as the number baptized, attendance on the different days, the unity and harmony displayed, etc., can be brought in to fill in the program details. The thought behind these talks should be that we are not to forget the assembly and its spirit, but to carry it on into the field so that others may share it with us. Also, persons who could not attend will be enlightened and those w’ho failed to appreciate the importance of attending will be made to know what a treat they have missed and be encouraged to plan for the next assemblies that will be provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Part II (8 min.) Experiences from the audience willbe entertained. The brother in charge of this part will arrange to have a variety of experiences related, by talking with various brothers beforehand and then calling particularly on those whom he knows will offer a stimulating experience to the audience. Others can also be called for if time permits. Experiences dealing with traveling to ana from the assembly, talking with people the brothers stayed with or interesting contacts made with brothers from other places or with persons of good will could be used: however, personal impressions made by the talks and the assembly Itself would also be beneficial.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Our Goal in the Ministry</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> How is the training program progressing in your congregation? It would be well to take stock and see what adjustments are necessary from time to time and determine who have progressed to the point where they do not need specialized assistance and can work alone or be assigned, in turn, to assist someone else.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Remember our goal: To aid less mature ministers to be mature house-to-house publishers ; and this means being able to witness alone from house to house and follow up the interest effectively with back-calls and home Bible studies. To accomplish this we must utilize the training program to the full. The more mature publisher will need to prepare himself, to teach effectively by ex</span><span class="font1">more help can be given each one. He reviews progress that the local congregation has enjoyed in carrying out the training program so far and tells of further prospects and blessings that will result during the coming service year if all co-operate with training program.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE I (8 min.) All study conductors, in round-table discussion, report on progress made at service centers as to training program arrangements. Show how some publishers have made excellent progress and are now in position to aid others who need assistance as well as new publishers. They discuss plans for greater improvement for the coming service year. With “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies and vacations over, all are able to work closely together to expand true worship. Conductors lay before publishers the arrangements for service activity so that they will be able to co-operate. (In congregations having only one or two service centers other servants may assist in this discussion.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Chairman (1 min.) Some are still not too familiar with procedure to follow when training another publisher from house to house. To get clear picture of what to do let us illustrate by demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE II (10 min.) This scene shows study conductor working together with less mature publisher in door-to-door work. Study conductor gives witness, using simple, easy-to-follow four-minute sermon, which arouses and holds attention of householder. Offer is accepted and arrangements are made for return visit. Between doors conductor discusses points of effective witnessing with less mature publisher. Less mature publisher gives witness at next door. Makes fair presentation, after W’hich study conductor makes encouraging remarks. Tells him presentation was quite good, then kindly and tactfully offers loving constructive counsel and suggestions for improvement, such as to follow theme, use Bible more, make comments to the point, let householder see scriptures and place literature in hands of householder, etc. Suggestions are well received by less mature, who eagerly awaits trying them at next door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Chairman (2 min.) Sums up by showing need for keeping this practice up throughout service year and outlines blessing to be expected as a result.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark27"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">ample and to give constructive suggestions for improvement. Likewise, the less experienced publisher will be diligent in absorbing and putting into practice the suggestions that he receives. Every opportunity to share in the service under this arrangement should be taken advantage of. They are “companions in service” and should make the best schedule in order to share in the service together as often as possible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Since many publishers are working together under the training program, are we to conclude that it Is recommended and advisable even for two mature publishers to work together in the house-to-house work? No, the goal is to aid each publisher to progress to the point where he can effectively witness from house to house without assistance. Our commission is to preach the good news and make the best use of our time and resources. We can reach more people, cover more territory, make more back-calls and aid more persons of good will to study Jehovah’s Word if each mature publisher works by himself, except where conditions in the territory seem to make It advisable for two to make calls together. So when not training a less experienced one mature publishers should work alone.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> From time to time the circuit servant or congregation servant will be making adjustments in trainingprogram assignments. Count it a privilege to share in this divine provision when invited and count It a blessing from Jehovah if you are one given the opportunity to receive assistance from one more experienced in the ministry. Take the assignment seriously as from Jehovah, for he now is providing for his people in various ways. The King is ruling I The Kingdom is in operation ’ On earth the King has given “some as missionaries, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work.” (Eph. 4:11,12, jVW) Are you taking full advantage of the provisions made by Jehovah through his organization in order to be a mature, effective house-to-house publisher?</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> From a number of places in the country, east and west, inquiries have come from brothers disturbed and uncertain as to what to do. This is in regard to arrangements that some congregations are carrying on for the holding of special sociable affairs, not only a local congregation backing them up with the approval of the congregation servant, but also inviting other congregations of the city or congregations in neighboring towns to join in, irrespective of their service arrangements or schedule. Even special announcements and feature programs are printed and distributed and invitation forms sent out for the congregation servant to sign. The ostensible purpose of such sociables is to get acquainted. “Hi there . . . JW’s . . . Let’s Get Acquainted” is how the front page of one invitation reads.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> The effort to ring in the congregation’s sponsorship and backing on the affair is causing a division among the friends. Rightly, many question the fitness of involving a congregation and the use of its facilities in order to ease the consciences of everybody.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Sociable get-togethers are and must remain strictly private affairs. The theocratic organization has appointed no entertainment servant for any congregation and will not do so. If our meetings at area group studies, Kingdom Halls, circuit, district, national and international assemblies do not enable us to assemble together regularly and get acquainted, then those who do or do not attend these gatherings are missing out on their privilege of mixing with their many brothers in a most wholesome, spiritually upbuilding, service-advancing atmosphere that is very refreshing.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> “Jehovah’s witnesses are at war I” This may sound strange to some, but not to God’s servants, who realize that true Christians today have the greatest fight of all history on their hands. Their spiritual warfare has been sanctified by the living and true God, Jehovah. As they assume their proper station it behooves all of Jehovah’s servants to maintain sanctity for theocratic warfare.—Deut. 23:14, A’W. came to be abused and taken advantage of for wrong purposes. (Jude 12) In these last days we must guard against becoming “lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.” We must guard against the forming of cliques and the mixing of groups just according to their age or their physical energies and abilities. We must guard against the deteriorating of our comings together from the high, theocratic, safe, beneficial plane to where the occasion takes on an appearance no different from that of a worldly group meeting for like diversional, entertainment purposes. We must not put the New World society in a bad setting or light. If individuals want to arrange among themselves a party aside from their service activities, that is a private, individual, not congregational matter, to be acted upon according to individual consciences and not with any congregational sanction or pressure behind it, putting some in an embarrassed position because of not falling in line for conscientious or other reasons, even when admission to the event is free and only contributions are accepted. None are to be criticized as self-righteous or extreme or one-sided because of choosing to keep their service responsibilities first on such entertainment occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> Hence Kingdom Halls are not to be used for such entertainments. Announcements are not to be made from the platform or over the microphone or by bulletin boards or by the distribution of handbills or programs at meeting places. No official sanction is to be given or sought by trying to prevail upon the Society’s appointed servants to subscribe to such in writing or making announcements at meeting places. The servants and the congregational facilities are strictly for service purposes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> As Jehovah's theocratic warriors begin a new service year greater zeal and determination will be . shown. During September we shall continue to present one book and a booklet on a contribution of 50c. How are we doing in placing the book-and-booklet offer? Have all placed at least one or more books?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> While the film “The New World Society in Action” will no longer be shown at circuit assemblies after the first part of September, the Society knows that a great number of congregations are still desirous of having the film shown locally. Therefore, the following arrangement has been made for the various congregations desiring to have showings to put on well-advertised public meetings.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Each circuit servant will ascertain what congregations in his circuit are desirous of putting on well-advertised public meetings with “The New World Society in Action.” He will keep a record of these congregations and as soon as he knows when the district servant is to serve the circuit he will contact congregations near the circuit assembly location that want to have the film shown and set up a tentative schedule. He will send the schedule to the district servant for approval and upon getting it back from the district servant he will advise the congregations scheduled for showings to make definite arrangements, which, among other things, will include proper and complete advertising work with handbills. Use the regular handbill order blank when submitting an order for the handbills.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Advertising the film with handbills for various evenings of the week has been very successful and effective throughout New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Eastern Pennsylvania. We feel it will be just as successful in other parts of the country as circuit and district servants and all congregation publishers enthusiastically get behind these special arrangements that have been made so that all people will have opportunity to see “The New World Society in Action.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">sermons, which serve excellently in starting home Bible studies. Whether working city or rural territory, note placements on House-to-House Record forms so interest located can be properly nourished. Strive for the goal of conducting at least one home Bible study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah is a fighter, and his people are likewise! Having Jehovah's backing, let us aid still others to join us in maintaining sanctity for theocratic warfare.</span></p></li></ul>

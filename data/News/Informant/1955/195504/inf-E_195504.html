<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Start Right Away</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> This is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the month! </span><span class="font3">Since receiving the March </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> and reading Brother Knorr’s exciting letter telling of a special new booklet to be released April 3, with keen anticipation all publishers have been eagerly awaiting the month of April! And now April is here! What are we going to do? Why, enter into the campaign as one man—like locusts—literally covering the land with this tremendous message. A powerful witness to Jehovah’s praise will result as each one does his share ‘preaching for the purpose of a witness.’—Matt. 24:14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Start distributing the booklet as soon as it is released. Quickly place the 20 copies you obtain following the public lecture April 3, and then get more and place them. Each publisher will want to place at least 30 copies and pioneers 100. But do not stop there! Encourage and assist other publishers and newly interested persons to share in this great booklet campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Should more booklets be needed during April or May, congregation servants will order by air mail. Mark the envelope “New Booklet Order.” If you do run out maybe you can get some from a nearby congregation or check with your own publishers. It may be they have more than they can use in their book bag or at home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">March 10, 1955</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My dear Brothers Everywhere:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is ‘the Light of the World’?” On Sunday, April 3, there should be more than 10,000 public meetings in all parts of the world giving people of good will the answer to that question. Will you be there with the “other sheep” that you have been teaching, so that they may know the answer too? I think you will. Then right after that meeting we shall all be able to get the new booklet and share in its world-wide distribution. The Society is ready and I hope you are too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the time of writing this letter to you I have information that I am sure all of you are interested in and it is this. There are 50,000 copies of this new booklet ready in Greece; 250,000 Danish copies have been shipped to the congregations in Denmark; and already there are off the press in Germany 1,650,000 copies. After day and night work in the Brooklyn factory for more than a month and a half we have finished and shipped 10,000,000 copies in English, 1,300,000 in Spanish, 125,000 in Italian, 295,000 in Hollandish and 210,000 in Portuguese. On the other side of the earth in Hong Kong our brothers have printed 2,500 in Chinese; in Japan they are ready with 30,000 copies; Lebanon got 10,000 ready in Arabic; our printing plant in South Africa will have ready by April 1 a total of 55,000 copies in Afrikaans, 25,000 in Sesotho, 25,000 in Xhosa, 55,000 in Zulu. Away up north opposite South Africa our new plant in Stockholm has produced 200,000 copies in Swedish; in Helsinki our printing plant has shipped out 195,000 copies for our brothers in Finland and is holding an additional 55,000 for rush orders; Norway is all set, too, with 95,000 copies in Norwegian. In Central Europe, Austria has arranged for printing its own supplies of 130,000 German copies. Our printing plant in Switzerland has had a big Job supplying France, Belgium and Switzerland itself with 420,000 in French and 134,500 in German. All these are ready!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I want to say &quot;thank you” to all of you in the branches for working so hard to get out these millions of copies by April 3. You all did excellently! Wonderful beyond words. Jehovah has blessed all of you in getting ready 15,312,000 copies of this new booklet and you will note they are printed in nineteen different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now our work begins! Let all of us ministers go into the field in the house-to-house work on April 3 and thereafter, taking its message to the world. May Jehovah’s rich blessing go with all of you as you prove that you are qualified to be Jehovah's ministers. Go forward. Preach for the purpose of a witness so that millions more may learn the truth. All of us will pray to Jehovah God to bless this special work to the honor and glory of his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> What a grand opportunity this booklet opens for newly interested persons I Thousands of them, at your invitation, will joyfully share in distributing this booklet. Grand blessings are in store for them, and for us, as we take the initiative to assist them. Just what should we do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> For one thing, bring them to the service center for booklet distribution. Yes, this means tactfully inviting and encouraging the persons </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font3"> study with. After you offer the booklet at a few doors with a 15-to 30-second presentation, then let them make the offer. It will be easy and a pleasure for them to do this by using one of the “Presenting the Good News” presentations. After a little experience, let them work alone. More territory will be covered and a greater distribution will result. All publishers should work alone with booklets, unless there are persons willing to go with you who have never gone out in the witnessing work before. Supply good-will persons with at least 10 copies of the new booklet to place with their friends, relatives, visitors and for house-to-house witnessing.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> As for reporting, each publisher will make out his own report on Kingdom witnessing. Those who un-</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant'd on page 3, col. 3)</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Announce Each Week in April: Ministers Active—Subscriptions Taken—Booklets Placed</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Preaching for a Witness</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This month, as all other months, Jehovah’s witnesses will preach for the purpose of a witness, regardless of where they may be located and what their surrounding conditions are. That this is pleasing to Jehovah, note the “Yearbook” experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Living behind the iron curtain is hard, but brothers there continue to preach. In Czechoslovakia a brother, trying to find new interest, worked one house on one street and then another house on another street and happened to call on a “comrade.” What happened? The brother faithfully preached and now a home Bible study is being conducted in the “comrade’s” home. (130)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Three ministers were sent to a town of some 25,000, mostly Catholic, where no witness had preached before. Soon the witnesses were invited to the parish to discuss the Bible with the priest. Many Catholic people present were amazed at the Scriptural answers given by the witnesses. Now some of the attenders preach. (Uruguay, p. 267) And on page 197 (Lebanon) read of the beauty operator who now witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Walking by a private home a publisher in Poland heard a person reading chapter twelve of Revelation. The publisher, like Philip, took courage, entered the home and gave a thorough witness to all present. The result? Four home Bible studies. (238)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Kingdom publishers in Eastern Germany continue to preach for the purpose of a witness under adverse conditions, in and out of prison, with telling effect upon people around them. The good recommendation of our brothers is “Not as we will, but as Jehovah wills, that long may we endure. We should like to adiponish all those, however, -who still have the privilege of enjoying freedom, to raise their voices even more intensively than up till now to the praise of Jehovah.” (157)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let all follow this good recommendation until Jehovah says ‘it is done.’</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Memorial</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">Attend the celebration of Christ Jesus’ death and help others to be at your Kingdom Hall on this most important evening in the calendar year. At the conclusion of the Memorial service the speaker should encourage and invite all present to obtain 10 or 20 copies of the new booklet for immediate distribution, and also make special week-end field service announcements. Congregation servants should mail their Memorial Report Card before midnight April 10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Again this month we are glad to supply several 15- to 30-second presentations that may be used to place the new booklet. All publishers should memorize one or more of the simple but effective presentations below or in last month’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font3">These and like short presentations will enable all to offer the vitally important new booklet at many homes in a short period of time.</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup> Use the New Booklet with the “Watchtower” Offer:</span><span class="font3"> This is the last month of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign. It should be the best month yet! By the end of April each Kingdom Hall “How Are We Doing?” chart should show at least two new subscriptions for each publisher. Where subscriptions are obtained the new booklet and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font3"> should be among the three free booklets. Where the offer is not taken endeavor to leave the new booklet on any contribution, generally 5c, or even two or three pennies. Interested persons who cannot afford to contribute may be given a copy free if they promise to read it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> Use It on Magazine Day:</span><span class="font3"> With booklets costing only a half cent a copy during April and its being a special booklet campaign, a new booklet can be given with every’ magazine placed on a 5c contribution. Tell the people this is a special offer for April only. Return the next week to see if householders wish to subscribe. If you have a supply of both magazines offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> and a booklet for 10c.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup> Use It from Service Centers: </span><span class="font3">self to be fully informed on this vital subject and it will pay you to know what this candid booklet contains. Y<sup>r</sup>ou may have this copy for . . .”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> With many new persons starting to witness this month the following presentation will be easy’ for them to remember and to use: “Here is a copy of the booklet that was printed for you. For many centuries Christendom has dominated this world and now the world’s fate is bound up with that of Christendom. Just what is the outcome going to be? I am sure you would enjoy reading this booklet and if you wish to contribute 5c or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> few pennies we shall be able to print more for a wider distribution.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> No, no more need be said. Use brief 15- to 30-second presentations. Do not stop to dicker or discuss. Place the booklet and let it give the details. Make the presentation warm and appealing and deliver it in a friendly manner. Offer it to any and all at every opportunity, before the book study, with literature offers, at home, work, anywhere. Cover all territory, for it is important this booklet be placed in every home possible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Special time adjustments in congregation book studies will be made the last two weeks of April to allow for booklet work. Starting the study a half hour later, with brothers assembling at least a half hour before the regular study time, will allow an hour or so for publishers and newly’ interested persons to distribute just booklets from service centers. Assistant congregation servants will advise study conductors promptly of all publishers who have not reported by the week end following Memorial. Study conductors and mature publishers will encourage and assist these to attend the service center and share in booklet distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> During the time that the study will start a half hour late, the study itself can be held for only </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> half hour. Then fifteen minutes will be spent hearing reports and interesting booklet experiences from enthusiastic publishers. This will be most stimulating to all and will help congregations to put forth more than the usual effort in this special booklet campaign. This will greatly assist each congregation to reach its 20 per cent increase in publishers I</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Seizing Every Opportunity</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (5 min.) Emphasize each must fully share in booklet distribution for campaign to be a success. Every opportunity must be taken by all. Engaging often in house-to-house service with regular offer, on Magazine Day, from service centers before studies, will open many opportunities for each one to place 30 or more booklets. Regularity in organized arrangements brings greatest results, but do not overlook opportunities in day-today business and social contacts. Also, “holiday” period for school children offers them an unusually fine chance to distribute booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (3 min.) Sister riding bus notes lady beside her reading newspaper. Casually she says, “My, all one reads is bad news these days,” and asks if lady can tell her why there is so much delinquency and immorality among those professing Christianity. When lady expresses wonder at trouble, sister suggests that failure to examine and live up to Bible principles is contributing cause. Suggests taking and reading copy of booklet that she has immensely enjoyed, as it shows Christ’s work on earth and how professed Christians bring dishonor to God by failure to follow Christ’s example while pretending to do so. Lady takes booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (3 min.) Brother, reading new booklet during lunch hour, is asked by fellow employee, “What are you reading?” Brother shows him and tells how it is being circulated worldwide because of its outstanding message. Everyone, atheists as well as God-fearing men, should read it. Shows him in booklet how questions are asked and answered on the beginning of the Christian religion. Brother has found it very revealing. Has another copy, which he places with fellow employee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (3 min.) Friends have dropped in to visit. Subject of world conditions comes up. Brother states straightforward and honest leadership is badly needed. Most people have lost faith in leaders of Christendom because of the inconsistency of their teachings and their disunity. Believes visitors will appreciate reading about true source of leadership and truth. Shows them in booklet where this is discussed. (Pages 6, 15, 16, etc.) Offers copy for them to take home. (Booklets may be carried when visiting relatives and offered at appropriate time.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE IV (4 min.) Two young brothers on vacation from school use time wisely working house to house </span><span class="font3">vious years, so we hope it will be this year. However, to reach the 184,763 goal will require (1) participation in the service by all publishers, (2) assisting persons of good will to share in the preaching work with us and (3) all reporting.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> From the first day of April on, throughout the month, let us </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">help one another.</span><span class="font3"> Any publisher who has not reported by the 10th should, without fail, be given definite assistance. This will result in approximately 184,000 publishers, for that</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">with booklets. Using sample presentations in “Presenting the Good News” each makes a call and places booklets. Decide they will continue working evenings after school starts again and after booklet campaign ends they will work -with magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (2 min.) Sums up the urgent need for young and old alike sharing. Participate in regular, organized witnessing and be quick to seize opportunities in day-to-day contacts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Helping New Ones to Start Publishing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (3 min.) Point out our responsibility is to teach good-will persons the truth and assist them to use the truth by joining in Jehovah’s worship. (Isa. 50: 4) How long have you been conducting a home Bible study? Have you helped these good-will persons to share in field work? Here is what we should have in mind and do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE I (10 min.) Bible study servant approaches publisher who has conducted home Bible study a long time with no evident results. He asks publisher if good-will person has been invited to share in booklet campaign from service center and to distribute 10 copies among friends. Publisher displays negative attitude. He conducts study regularly, feels things are progressing all right and that “sheep” will ask to start in work when he knows enough and recognizes obligations. Doesn’t want to rush things and scare sheep. By making following points servant agrees that none are to be pushed or coerced into serving God, but that we must be careful not to hold sheep back, either: 1. Sheep must be led, not forced, into service. 2. We must have same idea Paul had, namely, “view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work.” (Eph. 4: 12, NW) 3. As the person studying advances in knowledge and appreciation, encourage and train him to share in ministry. 4. Must aid sheep to recognize their responsibility and help them share in field service. (Isa. 50: 4; Rom. 10: 9, 10, NW) Has publisher endeavored to do this? No, publisher has held back, feeling conducting study was sufficient. Is thankful for counsel and will put suggestions into practice right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE II (4 mln.) On concluding home Bible study publisher tactfully invites one studied with to share in important booklet distribution. He gladly takes 10 booklets to distribute among friends and looks forward to doing booklet service from service center. Publisher supplies 15- to 30-</span><span class="font3">is about the number of publisher’s cards in congregation flies. And, of course, with thousands and thousands of new ones joining in booklet work and regular witnessing, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">how high will the April report go?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> All of us will have to work hard and be ministers during April and May, and always. After April all of us will be anxious to see the April report. Right now the Society anticipates receiving a report of “We Made It I” from virtually every congregation, and on totaling the April report it anticipates seeing a new all-time peak. Think all of us will be asking, “Can we make it 184,763 publishers?&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">second testimony that may be used and encourages him to become famil-. iar with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SCENE III (6 min.) In field work before congregation book study publisher presents booklet at couple of doors, using 15- to 30-second testimony, then invites one with him to use presentation at the next door. He does and places booklet. Yes, he can continue alone with this easy presentation and both do till study time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chairman (2 min.) Having the right view, we want to ‘train holy ones for ministerial work.’ Do your part by taking the initiative as just demonstrated and help new ones to start publishing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Five of the series of international conventions are scheduled for the United. States and Canada for 1955. At this time of the year our attention turns to making personal plans to attend one of these important </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">five-day</span><span class="font3"> assemblies. Remember, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">each</span><span class="font3"> day is very important, being heavily laden with spiritual food for the sustenance of life to all lovers of righteousness and good-will companions. Yes, it is the 1955 opportunity of sharing in </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">five</span><span class="font3"> days of New World living.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Spanish-speaking brothers will be interested in knowing that there will be Spanish programs at the Dallas, Texas, convention.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> General convention information, as well as Room Request forms and Volunteer Service forms are being supplied to all congregations with this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> and should be considered carefully at congregation service meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> We are admonished strongly by Christ Jesus that ‘man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth from Jehovah’s mouth.’ How urgent it is to take in spiritual food! Convention time is one of the best times to share in all the good provisions of Jehovah. Consequently, if you have not made up your mind to attend, let it be decided </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">affirmatively</span><span class="font3"> now and begin making your plans to attend the convention of your choice. the first week or two of May should be devoted exclusively to distributing the remaining booklets. Publishers should put forth a very extraordinary effort to go from house to house with just booklets. Use 15- to 30-second presentations to place what remains of the consignment. If the consigned supply is exhausted at the end of April, then follow regular campaign arrangements for May.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Throughout May, just as in April, be conscious of helping and assisting others to preach. Make arrangements to take new publishers In house-to-house, back-call, home Bible study and magazine service. They need your assistance this month and in the months to come, to become able ministers who can effectively help to deliver people of godly devotion.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> All who share in the witness are keenly interested in the results of the witness given locally, nationally and internationally. For this reason each publisher is invited to turn in a report of his witness activity each week. The over-all report not only lets us know the extent of the witness given and serves as a source of encouragement, but shows us wherein improvement is needed. Knowing the preaching efforts of each individual publisher permits those with spiritual qualifications to assist those who are in need of assistance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> During April all congregations will be working for a 20 per cent peak in publishers. We want to aid just as many as possible to share with us in giving the witness and to become a part of Jehovah’s New World society. April’s activity provides a grand opportunity to start good-will persons in field service by having them share in the distribution of the special booklet and other features of theocratic activity. We must take the initiative and help them get started, even though they may not feel adequately qualified at first.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> During April, since many will be sharing in the witness to some extent for the first time, the question arises, When should a person of good will begin to report? Here are a few things to keep in mind. A person’s first few incidental discussions with his neighbors and friends about the truth would hardly make him a publisher, although this activity on</span></p></li></ul>

He should show a desire to do the work and want to report his activity and not do so just because his parents or someone else feels that he should.

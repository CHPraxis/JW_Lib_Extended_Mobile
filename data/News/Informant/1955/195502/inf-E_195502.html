<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> The first three books of the Bible thoroughly covered verse by verse in the course of one year ! What a profitable study! What an insight into tlie wonderful purposes of Jehovah and his dealings with his people! Did you attend the school regularly and share in this detailed study during 1954? Surely all will want to join in this enlightening consideration of the Hebrew Scriptures as the next five books in Volume I of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">\ew&gt; World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> are reviewed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">School Changes</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> With the elimination of comparisons after each reading assignment the student has more time lor a good introduction and conclusion. Each reading should be prefaced by an appropriate introduction that establishes the setting and theme. A good conclusion should round out the assignment and further highlight the theme. Originality should be used in selecting a theme and in developing and then offer the subscription in that language.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Thus far in the campaign just “How are we doing”? Does the Kingdom Hall subscription chart indicate good congregation progress? How are we doing at each service center? Are we discussing the best methods of obtaining subscriptions and then putting the suggestions into practice in the house-to-house work? How many subscriptions have you personally obtained? Our individual efforts are reflected in the answers to these questions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Attending meetings is the first requisite. Ideas we can use in presenting the magazines are there brought out. We must be there to take them in. Also, preparation at home is essential If we are to use the ideas we learn and deliver effective sermons. With such a foundation we shall be eager to engage regularly in the the comments before and after the reading. A theocratic principle, proverb, analogy, command by Jehovah, exhortation that is to the point—all these and other means can be used to develop introductions and conclusions. To read well requires much preparation. Practice in order to become very familiar with the material. There is no short cut to attaining this familiarity.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Students preparing interpretative talks should avoid just relating what took place without giving the interpretative meaning of events, instructions, etc. The meaning of all details need not be given, but the interpretative meaning of the major points, as explained in the Society's publications, should be covered. Endeavor to select a theme that will embrace all the major points. This can be done if proper thought is given to the material, even though it may contain seemingly unrelated points.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> After subscriptions are placed each of us is responsible to make back-calls on subscribers. Many reports are coming in of the good results obtained from using ten- to fifteen-minute back-call sermons. Prepare them well: then make those back-calls. If you need assistance in preparing sermons or making back-calls, the mature brothers will aid you.Theocratic companionswill work together to prepare good house-to-house and back-call sermons.

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>A Recommendation Worthy of Consideration</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> A great deal has been said in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> relative to pioneering. Indeed, it is something worthy of consideration by each dedicated member of the New World society. Would you like to hear the recommendation of one who is actually overcoming obstacles and making adjustments in order to pioneer? Listen to this publisher of the good news who is approaching seventy years of age:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> &quot;1 started pioneering ten years ago. They have been ten happy, satisfying years. Yes, it meant hard work, . careful planning, going without things that some might consider necessary to proper living. During these ten years I have seen many evidences of Jehovah’s watchful care. I have never lacked for food or clothing or shelter. My physical wants have been well supplied and my spiritual blessings have been many. Surely if we trust his promises he will provide.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Around the World with Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Choosing Life Now</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">People as a whole do not realize it, but we are living in the last days of this old system of things. To survive its end and to live in God’s new world, one must choose life now to live forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Persons who have made the wise choice are always alert and desirous of helping others. Upon hearing an official complain about the weather and catastrophes a brother witnessed to him with surprising results. Now a regular study is held and several persons are taking in knowledge that will enable them to choose life. (Austria, 92) Though our work in the Dominican Republic is banned, many are being helped to choose life as Kingdom publishers take advantage of opportunities to speak the truth. (135)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How powerful is the truth of God’s Word? In Jamaica is a district known as “Iniquity Ridge.’’ The name speaks for itself. What adjustments are persons there willing to make to choose life now? An example of what sincere persons are willing to do is found on page 188.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An individual’s position or station in life, secular work or anything else should not be allowed to interfere with his choosing now to live forever. The man and his wife in Mauritius (252) who quit their job at the church are far ahead, and, to be sure, our faithful sister and her daughter in Korea (193) are setting an excellent example manifesting to all their decision to live now for the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Seeing</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The New World Society in Action” Part II</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Are people of good will and strangers favorably impressed on seeing “The New World Society in Action&quot;? You will enjoy reading various accounts of their reactions in the 1955 “Yearbook.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Out of curiosity a man with relatives in the truth saw the him. What now? He wants to become one of Jehovah's witnesses. (71) This is not an isolated case, as you can see from Argentina. (84) And that many people want to know more about the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses after seeing the film, note results in Brazil. (101)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Good-will persons are able to see the film, not only in large cities and at circuit assemblies, but also in remote sections. Thus the film is being shown wherever possible. It is interesting to read what resulted in two small towns in Panama where the film was shown. (231, 232)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before use in Aruba, N.W.I., the film had to be shown before a censor board that included a Catholic priest and a Dutch Reformed minister. Not only was it approved, but the minister requested it be shown at his church. In addition to its being shown to publisher groups many clubs and organizations are requesting that it be shown for them. (212. 213)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While handbills may now be used, three missionaries and two special pioneers in Haiti used a unique advertising arrangement that resulted in 1,200 persons’ assembling for the showing. (170) May the film continue to result in special blessings for Jehovah’s servants and men of good will.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Have you experienced being dismissed by a householder with “I’m not interested” before lie was fully able to understand the nature of your visit? It may have been his routine method of meeting and “getting rid of” door-to-door canvassers or a quick way to dismiss you because the preaching work had been misrepresented to him. In either event the minister should make an effort to break through this outer shell so that a witness can be given. Some fine suggestions as to how you might overcome this objection once it is stated are found in Lesson 50 of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers.</span><span class="font2"> The use of sueh suggestions is not a case of refusing to take “No” for an answer and stubbornly holding ground. Following such a course would not be in good taste and proper decorum.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Is there a way for Kingdom publishers to be certain that the householder is not answering before he knows what the visit is about? One might try meeting the objection before the householder raises it. For example, if you frequently encounter the “I’m not interested” objection, you might try a sermon like this:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> “Good morning. My name is---.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Undoubtedly you realize that world conditions are turning from bad to worse. Many people say ‘I’m not interested,’ but, really, none can remain oblivious or say that he is not interested in world woes, for all mankind are affected directly or indirectly.</span></p>

The theme, based on the chain word, should be highlighted. Good coherence will be attained by properly bridging together the various texts used in developing the talk. All students should refer to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font2"> often for improvement in speech and composition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> The theocratic ministry school plays a definite part in educating Jehovah’s people for life. Cultivate the good habit of regularly attending and sharing in the week-by-weel. consideration of Jehovah's Word. With only 61 per cent of the total publishers in the United States attending the school regularly, it can be seen that many more should be Though many people may show lack of concern, indifference or even take these things for granted, it is not a part of sound wisdom to ignore events that directly bear on the future destiny and safety of mankind. The entire human race is faced with trouble, perplexity and distress. This is not just a matter-of-fact occurrence. No !The Bible shows that these physical evidences conclusively prove that we are living in the time of the end. Mark 13: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">7</span><span class="font2"> and 8 says: [read], Jesus stated that all these evidences would occur during the generation of those living at the establishment of God's kingdom. [Mark 13: 30,31 | Some blame God for these happenings and that is exactly what the Devil wants people to do. [Summarize 2 Corinthians 4:4.] However, at Revelation 12: 7 to 9, Satan is labeled as the guilty culprit causing world woes. [Read texts.] Knowing our common enemy, it is. therefore, proper and fitting for us to put on the right type of fighting equipment. The apostle Paul recognized this important factor and wrote for our benefit at Ephesians 6:10 to 13: [ read].” Then tie in the offer, showing how it helps one to understand and cope with things happening today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> The presentation of the Kingdom message is a serious matter, involving life and death. This is reason enough for the servant of God to take the necessary initiative in overcoming objections and excuses automatically raised by the householders, or those that they might have in mind.</span></p>

Remember, more and more our ministry is being challenged and the only way we can give full proof of our ministry is by actually demonstrating that we are ministers in word anil deed.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">How “The Watchtower” May Be Used</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE I (3 min.) Conductor opens with a short talk on being explicit in our sermons in the house-to-house work. Specific words are more forceful than general ones. Opening the Bible ; and reading a text to the householder is more convincing than merely saying the Bible says so and so. With the magazine, too, some specific point of reference is more persuasive as to its value than are vague generalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE II (10 min.) At the service center before assembly for field service several brothers discuss talking points on the current issue of “The Watchtower” to use in service. The discussion should be lively and spontaneous, but it should be gauged so the audience can follow in their copies of the magazine and get the full value of the discussion. (A week before this demonstration the congregation servant should encourage all to bring the latest issue of “The Watchtower” for this service meeting.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">First go through the magazine, pointing out the outstanding features that are in every issue: the significance of the titles on the cover, the many fine statements in “The Purpose of ‘The Watchtower, ” the list of Bible </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">versions </span><span class="font1">used, the circulation number, the languages in which “The Watchtower” is printed, the study arrangement for the main article, “Questionsfrom Readers,” “Check Your Memory,” etc. One in the group will point out that he finds it advantageous to tie in with his sermon a definite statement or article in the current issue. Then after he has shown the magazine to be a source of further information on matters of truth in which the householder is already interested, he presents the offer. Give an example of this, using the current issue. Then others in the group will follow through, enthusiastically pointing out other </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">articles and specific statements or</span><span class="font1"> scriptures in that issue that can effectively be used in house-to-house presentation. With each item a suggestion should be given as to a theme with which it -would be appropriate Those in the group express appreciation for discussion, feeling better equipped for the day's service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE lit (4 min.) In conclusion conductor emphasizes the need of knowing the contents of the current issue in order to present it effectively. He shows that it is wise to give the householder a reason for wanting the subscription by pointing out life-giving information in the journal before the offer is actually presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Calling Back on “Watchtower” Subscribers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Chairman (2 min.) The seventeenth annual “Watchtower” campaign is on All publishers want to spend as much lime as possible in house-to-house witnessing, obtaining subscriptions. But after obtaining subscriptions we must not neglect calling back, else the following might result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE I (6 min.) Persons representing issues of “The Watchtower,” talking to servant, show what happened to them when they were delivered by mailman. One (recent issue) speaks of coming to a house and being laid in a desk drawer. He tells things he contains and what he could have done for subscriber if publisher had called back and helped him. The second “Watchtower” says he will illustrate what happened to him. Scene follows in which subscriber picks up newly received magazine and reads some of it, but does not understand much of what he reads. The man is an individual who is ‘sighing and crying.’ As the scene ends “Watchtower” tells servant how he wanted so badly to scream out and help the person, but no publisher called to assist “Watchtower” in doing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE II (3 min.) Servant sees publisher who placed subscriptions and tells him about the bad situation and the danger of losing much of his house-to-house effort in placing subscriptions if return calls are not made. Publisher is afraid it is already too late to help, but servant says, “Bet’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font1"> to see,” offering to show” publisher how effective it is to give a sermon based on an article in current “Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE III (3 min.) At the first home indifferent subscriber, who is really busy at the moment, is briefly shown the value of reading “The Watchtower” coming to his home. He promises to pay more attention to the magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SCENE IV (12 min.) At the second home servant uses ten- to fifteenminute sermon he has prepared on an article in the current magazine. He points out that the purpose of the call is to render a free service in connection with “The Watchtower” to demonstrate its proper usefulness, and explains that “The Watchtower” attempts to get people to look at things from God’s point of view, with a new world in prospect and a complete change near at hand. Subscriber’s attention is directed to information in an article. He is amazed at the clarity of thought and the ease with which he can grasp the material the magazine contains, with a little help. On learning the subscriber has not read the booklet “This Good News of the Kingdom”, servant explains it is a “Watchtower” article now in booklet form for the help of persons wishing to know basic truths regarding the Kingdom. Subscriber’s attention is directed to a couple of specific points in the booklet, which are briefly considered, and then arrangements are made to discuss additional points on next call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Chairman (3 min.) Publishers are encouraged to follow up on subscriptions. Subscribers need assistance to have attention directed toward the new world. Publishers must do their part by making return calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2nd Week:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Death (pages 88 to 90)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Publisher returns prepared to continue discussion on: (1) dead await resurrection, (2) death due to Adam will be done away -with, (3) what second death is and who incur it, (4) Christ’s part in resurrection and the blessings of endless life in store for all the righteous. Publisher then tactfully leads householder into study of “Let God Be True” or other publication placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">4th Week:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dedication (page 91 to Neh. 12: 27 on page 94)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Discussion between publisher and person of good will who has progressed to point of wanting to dedicate his life to Jehovah. Points covered: definition of dedication, preliminaries to dedication, how it is symbolized, examples of dedication, how it must be faithfully carried out in all features of true worship.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Can You Travel to Europe in 1955?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">February will find many brothers counting the cost<sup>-</sup> of the European convention trip in July and August. Many have been surprised to find how cheaply the trip can be made when compared with prevailing rates by regular transportation services. Everything possible is being done to cut expenses and yet provide a suitable trip. Chartered ships not only have very low rates (from $260 to $350 round trip, all meals included), but there is a choice of return dates. For those unable to remain in Europe until late August there will be a sailing from Bremerhaven, Germany, August 16, arriving Quebec City about August 25. This allows three full weeks in Europe, to attend assemblies in London, Paris or Rome, and Nuremberg. Space is still available on the ships and it is hoped that those who can will take advantage of the arrangements for the trip abroad. If you do not have your space application, write for one now. Additionally, reduced fares for special rail trips between assembly cities will be available, with many low-cost combinations possible (more information later). For room and board expenses it is advisable to figure a minimum of $5 to $6 per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Man.v are using the 30 per cent deposit arrangement on transportation, with full payment by March 1. When sending money’ to the Society clearly state whether it is an initial deposit or an additional payment on a reservation for which deposit has already been sent. It is permissible to submit reservation requests even though passport numbers are not yet available. When passports are received, send the passport numbers to the Society. This matter should always be covered in a separate letter for convenience in handling in the office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A Recommendation . . . </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cant’d) </span><span class="font2">will realize the great privilege it is to be a full-time worker in Jehovah's service. As the years increase my<sup>7 </sup>age I may have to slow down a bit, be a little less energetic because of lack of strength, but may the loving heavenly Father increase my zeal for his service and keep me giving all my time and strength to his joyous Kingdom preaching.''</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Full-time service for all who possibly<sup>7</sup> can so serve is recommended in the Bible, by the “faithful and discreet slave” and by those who are in this joyous service. Why not seriously consider your position again? If you can possibly make room for the pioneer service you cannot afford to be anywhere but in this field of theocratic activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup>A minister of Jehovah must take his ministry seriously. Acting as a right kind of minister brings life. Failure to do so results in death! Knowing that faith without works is dead, the right kind of ministers diligently study the Bible and then enthusiastically display a willingness to act as God’s ministers by teaching others Bible truths and, as such persons progress, training them to serve Jehovah.—1 Tim. 4: 6, A'IV.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>“Holiday” Witnessing Results</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In response to the Society’s suggestion that each congregation organize special group witnessing activity during the recent worldly “holiday,” hundreds of congregations made special group witnessing arrangements. It is a pleasure to report that publishers supported the arrangements very well and that the many letters received from congregations make most favorable comments on “holiday” witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Without exception the letters state that publishers were well received by householders and that placements and good experiences exceeded those on average witnessing days by far. Letters show that more magazines w<sup>r</sup>ere placed Christinas Day than any single Magazine Day to date. In fact most groups ran out of magazines before completing all the service they wished, as did the thirty publishers in Georgia who placed 681 magazines before exhausting their supply. No, not all areas had such high placements, but the results everywhere were above average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A pioneer sister who had refrained from going in service Christmas Day for thirty years states she was moved to do so this year by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> suggestion. What happened? She placed 53 magazines in less than two hours, more than she had ever placed before in one day ! Space does not permit more of the excellent results to be reported, but, to be sure, publishers who participated in “holiday” activity, along with many others, will be looking forward to special group witnessing on all future “holidays.” most half over. How are we doing? Do all publishers average one or more new subscriptions and pioneers at least eight? Having well-prepared three- to eight-minute sermons and then using them regularly in house-to-house work produce results. Are you going out regularly? As often as possible?</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> Year after year Jehovah’s people look to the months of March and April as peak publisher months. To meet the 20 per cent peak in April much must be done during March. It is suggested that a servants’ meeting</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Back-Calls</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> On placing literature with an interested person or having a good discussion with one manifesting sheeplike qualities, a publisher leaves the door with a happy feeling. He has been privileged to tell another and assist him to know about Jehovah God and his glorious purposes. The publisher has reason to rejoice, and he should ! But should his happiness and his responsibility end with the first call? Has the interested one been assisted sufficiently to care for himself? All Kingdom publishers know the answer to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">no ! </span><span class="font2">Back-calls must be made if the interest is to be developed, a home Bible study started and the sheeplike one tenderly assisted to choose life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> Back-eall service is a real joy! Already you are acquainted with the householder and know to some extent in what he is interested. Likewise, the householder is acquainted with you to some extent and, as mentioned on your first call, will be looking forward to your return visit. He should not be disappointed. By your making return calls persons really interested in the Bible, the ones Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned about, will readily be discerned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup> The purpose of a back-call is to give an additional witness, having in mind the starting of a home Bible study. Sometimes a study can be started on the first call, w’hile other times several calls are necessary. What is the best way to make back-calls? Publishers who are using ten-to fifteen-minute sermons report excellent results. One publisher reports starting three studies out of five calls made using the suggested baek-call sermon in the November </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> Be sure to attend the service meeting when the back-call sermon demonstration in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Inform-</span><span class="font2">be held the first part of March to discuss local arrangements for making March and April peak publisher months. .Since most efficient service is made possible through service centers, organize work from these een ters, letting each’ group have 100 per cent as its goal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> But even more is required for our 20 per cent peak—new publishers ! How long have yon been conducting your home Bible study ? Thus far you have helped the persons with whom you study to take in accurate knowledge. Now help them to share in Jehovah’s strange and enjoyable work by acting as the right kind of ministers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ant</span><span class="font2"> is put on. You will conclude that there is no doubt that preparation is the key to successful back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> Theocratic companions in the training program should prepare for and make back-calls together. Such calls may be made following the two or more hours spent in regular house-to-house service on Sunday morning, on the back-call night set aside by the service center or at other times convenient for the two publishers. In making a call both may count witnessing time, but, of course, only one will report the back-call. For one to report a back-call he must say something to contribute to the call. Those being trained may start out by reading a few scriptures when called for, and, gradually improving, they will be able to make calls alone.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> The Bible study servant in a congregation that has sufficient brothers to care for servant duties to allow him, as well as the congregation servant, to visit service centers will have in mind assisting service-center groups to increase their back-call and home Bible study service. He will work with as many publishers as he can, giving helpful suggestions and being of assistance to theocratic companions in planning and making back-calls. Congregation book studj conductors will set the proper example by taking the lead regularly in back-call service and helping those in their groups in need of assistance</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup> As set forth in our new slogan at the bottom of this page, we are interested in making more back-calls and developing more home Bible studies. Let each publisher assume his responsibility before Jehovah and be diligent, not only in finding the sheep by regularly engaging in house-to-house service, but in feeding them as well, through the back-call and Bible study service.</span></p></li></ul>

<h6><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Assist Newly Interested to Attend Nearest Convention</span></h6>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has an important message to be heralded far and wide throughout the land. Because of its importance the New York convention, June 23-25, has been extended to take in Chicago and Los Angeles in the United States, and London and Glasgow. The heart of this extraordinary convention will be in New York City, but, as it is a network convention, other cities will probably be tied in with New York in addition to those mentioned above. The same program will be carried at all points simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Big Feature</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The big feature of this network convention will be the lectures by Brother Rutherford, both on Saturday and on Sunday. On Saturday, from 3 to 4 p.m. New York Time, all of the convention cities will be tied together by means of telephone lines and amplification systems in each of the convention halls. Again on Sunday. 4 to 5 p.m. New York Daylight Saving Time, the lecture “Government and Peace” will be brought to all these auditoriums. All of the anointed and their companions who can possibly get to one of the many conventions arranged will surely do everything within their means to attend. Additionally, from now until the time of the convention there will be the privilege of encouraging the newly interested persons on whom you are making back-calls to come to this convention. At these large gatherings the enthusiasm and zeal of the Lord’s people are at their height. These conventions show the strength of the Lord’s organization on earth, give the “stranger” a clearer conception of the good will and earnestness of those who love the Lord, and remove all fear from the minds of the newly interested that this might be “just another religion”. Seeing Christians energetically performing the commandments of God will aid them in taking a stand for the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Advertising</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The greatest advertising campaign ever arranged for a public discourse will be carried on to let the people know about the lecture &quot;Government and Peace”. Some of the means that will be used in this convention are herewith mentioned. In all convention cities, five weeks before the date of the convention the publishers will start using a special handbill announcing the public meeting. This handbill will be used within a radius of 100 miles of each convention city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another special handbill will be prepared for each convention city to use during the week the convention is held. This will be designed differently and made more attractive, and with thousands coming to the convention, great portions of each city will again be covered with an announcement of the public meeting. Thousands of placards will be placed in conspicuous places throughout the cities. “Sandwich sign” parades will begin three weeks before the time of meeting, and as the date of meeting draws near more Intense witnessing will be done by this method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Silk screen signs of the size approximately 30 inches by 50 inches will be made and displayed in windows, posted on outdoor boards, on sides of houses, on trucks and on backs of automobiles—in fact, any place where these signs can be posted they will be used. Three special inserts will be printed for the electric flasher signs, which will be used extensively throughout all convention cities. These inserts should be changed every three days, thus attracting much attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sound-cars will soon begin announcing the public meeting over their equipment. From now until the time of the convention, on all their back-calls the brethren will point out the Importance of attending the convention. A special letter has been prepared by the Society and will be mailed to every </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> subscriber in each convention city ten days before the meeting. Special invitation cards will be enclosed in this letter inviting them particularly to the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With all the handbills, placards, “sandwich sign” parades, sound-car announcements and numerous other means of advertising this convention, Madison Square Garden ought to be packed out as well as every hall in the United States and England now engaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Book Room</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society will have a book room at each convention city. The literature to be used will be the special offer for June, namely, 7 booklets on a contribution of a quarter. Obtain your supply of booklets for the convention at the convention book room, as these will be made up in combinations of 7 and enclosed in a wrapper inviting the people to attend the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cafeteria</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each convention is arranging to operate a cafeteria. The food served will be wholesome, but no elaborate arrangement can be set up for the three days. Money spent at the cafeteria will be used to defray the expenses of operating the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immersion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Local arrangements are being made for a baptismal service. The time will probably be early Sunday morning, thus allowing those who are immersed to participate in the field service on Sunday. Those desiring to be baptized will as-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 2, column 1)</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Timely Message for All to Hear</span></h6>
<p><span class="font6">We look forward with keen interest to the public meeting at Madison Square Garden, at which time Brother Rutherford will deliver the lecture “Government and Peace”, a message which Jehovah wants given to the people of the world. Not only will those fortunate enough to get into Madison Square Garden and other convention auditoriums throughout the world be able to hear, but, due to the importance of this message, a radio chain is being arranged and approximately 100 stations, we hope, will take “Government and Peace” into the homes of millions of other people. Special radio folders will be consigned to all companies sometime before June 25. As soon as you receive them, make every effort to distribute them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In all your back-call work from now until the convention, point out to these people the importance of attending this convention, or, if they cannot attend, of listening in on the radio. The responsibility rests upon every publisher to stress the message that will be sent forth from this international convention, “Government and Peace.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>General Information</span></h6>
<p><span class="font6">Pioneers are to send in $1.00 with all renewal subscriptions for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font6"> as there is no special rate on renewals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pioneers and company servants should give their full name and address at the upper right-hand corner of each letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Company servants living outside of the town by which the company is known should always show the name of the company at the head of each letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pioneers who are also serving as company servants should definitely state on each order submitted ] whether it is a pioneer or a com-। pany order, whether remittance is for the company or on pioneer account, etc. Pioneers serving in such capacity should always send in two Change of Address notices: one on a regular pioneer Change of Address slip and another on a regular sheet of paper, stating on the latter that such change is for address as company servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Companies receiving Distributors’ copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> should promptly notify the office of every change in the address or personnel of the one to whom these copies are being sent. Always, when sending in such notice, state the change is for “Distributors’ copies coming in the name and address of” whoever the party may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shortwave Reception</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The two lectures by Brother Rutherford, one on Saturday at 3 to 4 p.m., Eastern Daylight Saving Time, and one on Sunday at 4 to 5 p.m., will be transmitted by shortwave to London, England. Those publishers not attending the convention and having shortwave sets should try to tune in somewhere between 16 and 50 meters. You may be fortunate enough to get the lecture. A report of your reception will be appreciated at the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those company publishers remaining at home and able only to tune in the Sunday radio lecture may wish to send a report of their reception immediately. If so, the telegraph and cable address is “Watchtower, Rutherford, Brooklyn, N. Y.” It is also hoped that publishers will send a letter of appreciation to the station to which they are listening, relative to this program.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Convention Expenses</span></h6>
<p><span class="font6">In cities where conventions will be held June 23-25 brethren are asking the privilege of paying the expenses as far as is possible for them to do so. Any of the remnant, Jonadabs or others interested who are not in the vicinity of the local convention and who desire to participate especially in the expenses of the general convention may make their remittance for that purpose direct to the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">—Don't Forget Subscriptions—</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Electric Flasher Signs</span></h6>
<p><span class="font6">The Society still has a supply of the electric flasher signs in storage. It would be much better if these were in use throughout the country, advertising the Kingdom. In order to get all of these in use the Society is offering two signs for 50c. In the convention cities these flasher signs can be put to very good use between now and the convention in advertising the public meeting. In other places you can advertise your local radio station, if in the chain; and at all times you can use these signs to advertise your local public meetings as well as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> studies. Order should be placed through the company servant for those you desire. We should like to get them all in use during the month of May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On going to press May 9 there were</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">106,758 new “Watchtower” subscription* </span><span class="font6">reported (world-wide) What will it be by the end of May? </span><span class="font5">Don’t Forget Subscriptions</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In the “box” is shown the total of new </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> subscriptions in the office as this </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font6"> goes to press. Our 100,000 goal is exceeded and not all reports are in. This is wonderful. Continue this fine effort during May and get just as many new subscriptions as possible!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The book and booklet placements, however, are not so good, and indications are that to reach the quotas it will be necessary for all to specially stress books and booklets during May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> Campaign extended another month, many companies should be able to cover much of their rurals during the four weekends and Tuesday the 30th with the special offer, blanketing all their small towns with the two “hailstones” of truth, Face </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the Facts</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font6"> and spending evenings during all of May in booklet distribution. Keep in mind that all the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font6"> in stock should (due to the special offer printed on the back cover) be disposed of as soon after April 30 as possible. Publishers may go out singly or in groups in the evening work, leaving the two booklets on 5c contribution or the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font6">booklet free when no contribution can be made. Longer daylight hours (and daylight saving time in many places) will make this evening work available to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Keep in mind, too, the various</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Six-Month Comparative Report</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h6><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Best We Have Ever Had</span></h6>
<p><span class="font6">There is shown herewith report of field activity during the first six months of this fiscal year compared with same period a year ago. While there is a decrease in bound books, this is more than offset by the splendid increase in booklets, the net increase in pieces of literature being well over a million and a half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Note that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">average</span><span class="font6"> number of publishers, 32,173, or an increase of 8,520 over last year, is an increase, as well, over the 1938 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">peak</span><span class="font6"> number of publishers of 31,351, which was had last June. Additionally, all will be pleased to know that a new peak of 34,179 publishers was reached in March; and, without doubt, 35,000 and more will have been out in the field service during April. Each company should see that its present peak is maintained and every effort made to increase it during the coming months, remembering our goal of 40,000 publishers for 1939!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The increase in sound attendance is evidence that we are seriously </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2) </span><span class="font5">semble in the first few rows of the auditorium at the time the talk on Baptism is given. Each one should provide his own swimming suit and towel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Music</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each convention will arrange for an orchestra. Those playing instruments should report to the chairman of the convention on arrival, bringing their instruments with them; also song books with notes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Parking</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No special arrangements are being made for taking care of parking of cars in New York City. As the convention is being held in the heart of the city, there is very little room for parking cars. We recommend that persons coming to New York in cars park them somewhere near their room accommodations and use the subways, which will be cheaper and quicker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other convention cities are making arrangements for parking where it is convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">DON’T FORGET SUBSCRIPTIONS </span><span class="font6">other methods suggested in previous Issues of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font6"> for placing the booklets. Reports reaching us indicate great success in placing booklets in “sandwich sign” parades. To aid in this, the two booklets may be tacked, one above the other, to a stick similar to that used for the “Serve God” signs, with a square cardboard reading “5c” so It is not necessary for the ones carrying the booklets to stop and explain to the people along the line of march.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">May 31 not only ends the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> Campaign, but also the very special rate to pioneers and companies on </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font6"> booklets. Beginning June 1 the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">cost of all self-covered booklets will be the same;</span><span class="font6"> that is, the same rate that now applies on </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Safety</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon</span><span class="font6"> booklets. All orders received June 1 onward will be so charged. However, during May we will ship out all the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom </span><span class="font6">booklets you may need, and hope all these booklets will be placed in the hands of the people by May 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While May 31 ends the special </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> Campaign, yet every publisher should continue to offer </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> (and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation) </span><span class="font6">to the interested people at every opportunity. A goal of three more new subscriptions for this year should be set for each company publisher, while the pioneers should set a quota of at least six more new subscriptions for this fiscal year, which ends with September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">considering our slogan, “Every witness a phonograph.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The outstanding feature of the accompanying report, however, is the tremendous increase in back-calls. The new figure of 610,282 means that practically every publisher is striving hard for the one back-call per week, and that some are making many more than that, taking to the “other sheep” the “meat in due season” which the Lord has so bountifully provided at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s rich blessing has been bestowed upon us, and we will show our appreciation by using our every faculty to His praise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Public Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Madison Square Garden is one of the largest indoor auditoriums in the world. Other very large auditoriums are being obtained throughout England and the United States. It will be the desire of every publisher to do his part in trying to pack out these auditoriums by advertising to the very best of his ability the convention and “Government and Peace”, the lecture to be delivered by Brother Rutherford June 25. Make it your business to bring some people of good will to the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All pioneers in continual service for six months or more will be credited on their book account with the sum of $10 upon receipt of a post card stating which convention they attended. The post card should be directed to “Pioneer Desk” and mailed from the convention city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rooming Accommodations</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One very big problem will be finding accommodations for all publishers for three days. The New York company is hard at work on this. It is suggested that you write the Convention Room Committee as soon as you can after June 1, so that your accommodations</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">To all of those on the Lord’s side the month of June is the “New Eabth” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to the Lord this “new earth” will be glorious. It is the footstool of Jehovah, and His witnesses are now given the privilege of carrying knowledge regarding this wonderful provision to the people of good will who desire to take advantage of It</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The agency that the Lord has arranged to comfort the people during the month of June is 7 booklets on a contribution of 25c, composed of 4 colored-cover booklets and 3 selfcovered booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There will be no testimony card supplied by the Society for this combination. Therefore, use your phonographs and the record P-101, “Value of Knowledge,” to introduce the booklet combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Where you are unable to place seven booklets, drop to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font6"> or any other self-covered booklet on any contribution they are able to make. If they are unable to contribute, leave a self-covered booklet with them if they are sufficiently interested to desire to read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When witnessing in foreign-language territory a combination of seven booklets in that particular language is to be offered, the same as in English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All companies are to clean out their present stock, starting first with those of which they have the largest number in stock and reducing them until they bring the supply</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">can be mailed to you and you will know where to go when you arrive at the convention city. In your application for rooms state what price you desire to pay, the kind of accommodations you want, the number in your party, and how many in a room. Set out all the details clearly in your letter. Select your convention city now, and then arrange for your accommodations with one of the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Watchtower Convention Room Committee 5955 S. Richmond St.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chicago, Ill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Watchtower Convention Room Committee c/o Embassy Auditorium 9th and Grand Ave. Los Angeles, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Watchtower Convention Room Committee 117 Adams St. Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Service In the Field</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The territory to be covered in each city is being carefully planned and mapped out for the publishers. The booklet campaign carried on during the testimony period in June will also be effective during the convention days. Combinations of 7 booklets will be provided the publishers at the convention book rooms, and these combinations will have a special wrapper announcing the public meeting on Sunday. It is expected that many thousands of booklets will be placed in the convention cities. The service in the field will include not only the door-to-door witnessing with the literature, but also the use or phonographs and soundcars, distribution of handbills, engaging in “sandwich sign” parades, and making back-calls wherever possible. Come prepared to devote a good portion of your time in advertising “Government and Peace”. Each publisher finding interest that is deserving of a back-call should arrange the same and turn In the Back Call slip to the convention city. The local publishers, we hope, will take care of these immediately thereafter. It is believed that more than 30,000 publishers will be engaged in the field work in these international conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All company servants should announce between now and the convention the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Report your activities of field service at the convention on a regular Publisher’s Field Service Report slip. Keep a duplicate of this report and, on returning home, turn this duplicate slip over to the local company servant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Traffic</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publishers driving cars should be sure they have with them their driver’s </span><span class="font6">down to a normal amount, then using others until their entire stock is balanced. Companies, for the duration of this campaign, are hereby authorized to transfer booklets to the pioneers working in their territory, and pioneers are urged to draw on the company’s stock for their supply, as long as the company has an available supply. However, companies are not to order an extra supply to provide for pioneers. When such a transfer is made a regular Transfer of Stock form is to be filled out and signed by both the company servant and the pioneer. The Transfer forms are to be retained until the end of the campaign and then they are to be promptly sent in to this office by the company servant. Pioneers are not to send in any notices of such transfer of stock, the one sent in by the company servant being entirely sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pioneers who cannot get their booklets from company stock, and such companies as do not have an adequate supply of booklets on hand, should order direct from the Society at once.

<p><span class="font5">Trailer Camp</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society suggests that pioneers do not haul their trailers long distances for only a three-day convention. There will be no trailer camp provided at New York City, as none can be arranged close enough to the convention halls to be convenient. If you come in your trailer, park it somewhere outside of the city. As to arrangements for trailer camps in other convention cities, write to the rooming accommodations committee for details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Transportation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many special rates are in effect now, particularly to New York, because of the World’s Fair. Inquire of your local railroad agent and at bus terminal as to what is the best fare to New York and return. Inquiries should also be made locally for group rates by train and by bus to other convention points. Zone servants may be of some assistance to the various companies in arranging for transportation. Those coming by automobile and not having their cars filled might arrange with other brethren to come with them and bear a part of the expenses. The publishers should also do what they can to assist the newly interested to get to the convention.</span></p>

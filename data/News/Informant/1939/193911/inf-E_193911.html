<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER, 1939 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But ‘hey shall not prevail against thee.”—Jer. 1:19.

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Continue “Theocracy” Offer During November</span></h3>

<p><span class="font4">During ‘'Theocracy” Testimony Period our offer to the people was </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> on a contribution of twenty-five cents. We are sure that all are anxious to supply as many as possible in their territory with these two important pieces of literature; and so the same offer will continue during the entire month of November.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the publishers who engaged in the Kingdom service during October should be busily engaged therein during November, and, in addition, there should be others seeing their privileges. Note that last November there was a slump in number of publishers; so let each one determine to give a good account of himself. While there are only four Sundays in the month, many will be off from secular work on Thanksgiving Day and can utilize that day by really showing their thanks to the Fathei- by passing on to others that which will point them the way to salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Comparing the first two months’ placements of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> with that of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> an Increase of 40,000 books is shown, which is gratifying. But it must be remembered that considerably more publishers were working with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation;</span><span class="font4"> so it behooves all to make a greater effort in the placing of this book. Familiarize yourself with it, so you can show the people the importance of obtaining it; use all the aids provided : “Snare and Racket” record, testimony card, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News, Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> booklet, and (in preparation for the next visit) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> folders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And remember, leave a copy of the new booklet at every call, if at all possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Reports indicate that many of the companies are not represented at the zone assemblies arranged by the Society. As outlined in Organization Instructions, these assemblies are designed to aid all publishers in furthering the interests of the Theocracy. The assembly is a provision of the Lord for the benefit of all, including the pioneers, who should also attend when it is convenient for them to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the Saturday night meeting, the regional servant meets with the zone servant and all company servants and their assistants to consider reports and other conditions pertaining to the Kingdom activity in the zone, giving such counsel and aid as is necessary.

<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Kingdom News </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to Have Wide Distribution</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">This is the title for our December special period, and naturally calls to mind the great issue facing the Lord’s people at the present time. It brings to the fore the thought of the warfare that Jehovah of hosts is prosecuting, and reminds us of the great Theocrat and the vindication of His name. Therefore the title must inspire everyone on the Lord’s side to determine, by His grace, to devote as much time and energy as possible to this campaign during the month set aside for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Commence planning now, so that the greatest amount of time will be given and the most effective co-operation rendered by you. Today every agency of the Devil’s organization is assembled against the great Theocracy, and it is the privilege of the anointed and their companions, in the strength of the Lord, to go forward against this array and push with greater vigor than ever before in this War of Vindication, absolutely confident of their ultimate victory. The name of Jehovah is involved. There is no middle ground for the Lord’s people now. Those on the Lord’s side must publicly show themselves for Jehovah and his Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has graciously provided the weapons for this warfare. They are not carnal, but mighty for the accomplishment of the purposes the Lord has in mind. The particular provisions for this campaign are made to order for the “War of Vindication”. The primary offer is three booklets on a 10c contribution, all combinations to include </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> and any other two booklets with which you may be heavily stocked. In addition to the three booklets, include </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font4">No. 5 in every combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A brief analysis of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> will help visualize the power of these weapons. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace </span><span class="font4">opens up by defining what the Theocracy is. Next it manifests the inadequacy of the existing makeshift which the Devil is desperately trying to retain. Next it shows how the Theocracy may be had and enjoyed. After that it tells the people when they may expect the Theocratic government to rule, and then calls their attention to the desperate opposition to the Kingdom now in evidence from every element of the Devil’s organization, and concludes with the great privilege now available to all order-loving Catholics, Jews and itable and necessary to attend this meeting, urging his assistants to do so as well; and when he cannot attend he should, by all means, be represented by someone in the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Protestants and all others who forsake religion and choose and serve Jehovah and Christ his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All these facts are vitally connected with the “War of Vindication” and are of paramount importance to the people of good will. Jehovah has entrusted his people with the great privilege and responsibility of carrying this very important message to the people; therefore this is our part in the “War of Vindication” committed to us by Jehovah through his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> booklet contains the “Victory” speech, visualizing Jehovah’s organization and the battle, declaring the determination of the Lord’s people to take their position on Jehovah’s side in this War of Vindication and thus be instrumental in raising up a standard for the people. It is thrilling beyond words to be privileged, by God’s grace, to carry this message to the people now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> No. 5 presents the issue squarely to everyone—“Can Religion Save the World from Disaster?” The Lord's people know the answer; there are millions who do not. These people are entitled to this information provided by the Lord. Therefore let each and every one with zeal and joy go forward carrying it to them. The greatest inducement to place </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> No. 5 in the hands of the people, of course, is the fact that religion lias been the chief instrument used by the Devil to blind the people to the glory of God and induce them to ignore God and the Bible. Therefore the exposing of religion is directly related to the War of Vindication, and anyone who loves the Lord cannot hold back from having a part in its distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Where the people are unable to accept the three booklets on a 10c contribution, drop to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> on a 5c contribution, or any contribution they are able to make, even one cent; and if they are interested and want to read but are unable to contribute, leave </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> with them on their assurance that they will read them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The object of this campaign is to cover as much territory as possible with this very important message during the month of December. Therefore a thorough organization, speed and effectiveness are necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the publisher Is able to play the “Snare and Racket” record, then, of course, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font4">should also be offered in addition to the foregoing combination, on a contribution of 60c or 35c, depending upon whether they wish to take both or one of the bound books.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Are the People of Good Will Attending Your “Salvation” Studies?</span></h3>
<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Are Studies Conveniently Located?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> Is the Lord’s provision for instructing the people of good will in the way of salvation. One main study should be held at the headquarters of each company; and, in addition to this, at strategic points throughout the company territory, there should be established </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> studies which would be convenient to a number of publishers as well as to people of good will. The publishers should always attend the study in their area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The study conductors should also arrange to hold the territory in the immediate vicinity of the study, for those attending. This territory should be worked regularly as outlined in the new form forwarded to the companies recently. The study conductor should lead the publishers into the field, thoroughly witnessing to the people in that vicinity, making back-calls, conducting model studies, and inviting the people of good will to attend that meeting. The study conductor also should have all back-call names in that particular area and see that these people are properly called upon and invited to the study, or have other assistance as may be necessary provided for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> studies, however, should not be used as an excuse to discontinue the model studies in that particular vicinity. Back-calls should be made as usual, and each back-call should be developed into a model study, and as the people progress in the model study they should be invited to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> study. In fact, it is not necessary to wait until the conclusion of the model study before inviting the people to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> study. They should be attending both studies for a while, and, of course, when they are attending the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> study they should also be invited to attend the headquarters’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study and service meeting. In this way the various features of the organization can co-ordinate in developing the interest all over the territory, gradually working it into the company organization.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Remember Hours, Back-Calls and Being a Publisher</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The fiscal year, which ushered in the new Theocratic arrangements, has been replete with blessings from Jehovah. The report, which will be given in detail in the 1940 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font4"> (which ail Kingdom publishers will read with interest and profit), shows that, true to His promise, ‘God gave the increase.’ This increase was manifest not only in the placements of literature with the people, but particularly in the gathering of God’s “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The high points of the report for the United States (including pioneers) are increases over the previous year of almost 10,000 publishers, half a million pieces of literature, three million hours, one million back-calls, and 60,000 subscriptions. The increase in publishers would have been still greater had the publishers been more regular in the service. Reports from zone servants indicate that a large percentage are ‘spasmodic’ publishers, which caused the reports of both publishers and placements to fluctuate greatly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society has set a quota of publishers for the United States at 50,000, based on a 25-percent increase over the peak of publishers during 1939. Each company should set a like quota, and should also set a quota of hours for the year. This may be arranged by having each publisher turn in a slip of paper Indicating thereon how many hours monthly he will possibly be able to use in the Kingdom service. It is not necessary for him to sign his name to this slip. These hours can</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Please Give the Office Time to Fill Your Orders</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">It is strongly urged that all the companies and pioneers send in their orders for literature far in advance of the date they wish it, so that the orders can be shipped the most economical way and yet reach you in time. We also request that you make your orders for 100-pound shipments and do everything possible to avoid “rush” orders. Remember, there are over 2,500 companies and over 2,000 pioneers, as well as branches, placing orders for literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You will appreciate the necessity of “giving us time”, when you see the great volume and visualize how your orders are handled. On receipt of your order, which took a few days to get to the office, it is turned over to the bookkeeper for checking against the account, then invoiced; invoice is checked over to see that all items you ordered have been listed, and labels are made; order is then figured as to weight and cheapest way to ship, finally filled from the nearest depot, and then turned over to the shipping concern, from which it comes to you. You must allow </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">at least</span><span class="font4"> two weeks for the above, including the time it takes freight shipments to points within 600 or 800 miles from the depots, and at least three or four weeks for more distant points (especially when shipped by boat), from the time the order reaches this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the present time, because of the extra work involved in getting out </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> books and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> booklets, we are about 15 to 20 days behind in the handling of all orders. Please take note of this and do not write in asking why your order has been delayed. Because of this extra rush of work no then be added up, divided by the number that turned in slips, and multiplied by the peak number of publishers reporting In 1939. This would be multiplied by 12 to get the quota for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The quota for company publishers is four back-calls per month. Due to the importance which was continually accorded to baek-calls during this past year, with the publishers realizing the necessity of continually ‘feeding the other sheep’, it was possible for the company publishers to report an average of 2.2 for the year. By the Lord’s grace, this will be raised during this year to the quota of 4 per month per publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord is pleased to have his people very busily engaged in &quot;his strange work”; and so, realizing that the time is very short in which to do the work entrusted to us, we will determine during this fiscal year to put forth every effort to advance the interests of The Theocracy. A goal of 60 hours per company publisher was set by the president of the Society in his letter of last January, “To All Kingdom Publishers,” and in the December 1, 1938, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> That all publishers have viewed this seriously is reflected in the increase shown. By putting forth a greater effort than ever before, this will no doubt be materially increased this year. Some, being able to make the necessary arrangements, will increase their hours to the extent of serving as pioneers. A letter fully explaining the pioneer service will be sent upon request to those desiring to consider this important service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">phonographs are being made, but we shall start making these soon and begin to fill orders dated September 5. So be patient, and, above all, send in your orders early.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Many apparently do not understand the Society’s arrangements regarding supplying phonographs and records to those who are unable to pay the full amount at the time of ordering. The Society is glad to cooperate with and aid all the brethren who want to take advantage of this arrangement to serve the Lord and advance the Kingdom interests, by assuming part of the burden for a period. However, all orders for phonographs and records should be accompanied by a reasonable down payment unless your account has a credit balance to cover the cost of the equipment. If only part payment is made with the order, the balance should be sent in as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We do not open accounts for the different individuals in the companies. All orders should be sent to the Society through the company organization. The orders should be turned over to the company servant or stockkeeper with the down payment. He will then put through the order in the usual way. The order will be filled and shipped and charged to the company’s account, and all subsequent payments, until the entire amount is taken care of, should be made to the company, the company in turn remitting to the Society.</span></p>

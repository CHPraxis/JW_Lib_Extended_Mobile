<p><span class="font1">consult the “My Daily Kingdom Service” record sheet to see the progress being made daily. If a publisher finds he is getting behind in his quota, then he should take immediate steps to put in the necessary time to make up this deficit, and not wait until the last few days of the campaign to do so. For such an emergency each publisher should have individual territory assignment close to his home (and place of business) and which can be worked at odd times or whenever the weather is bad and it is impractical to witness with a group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If at all possible, each time you engage in the field service carry a phonograph along with you and at least the record “Miracles” and &quot;Instruction”, P-153, P-154. Take with you the special Testimony card provided for this campaign, a few samples of the current </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoioer, </span><span class="font1">some bound books, and a good supply of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> booklets. Also, take some </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoioer</span><span class="font1"> subscription blanks, back-call slips, and cards or slips bearing the name and address of the meeting place where the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> studies are held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Offer the Entire Combination</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The special combination to be stressed at each call, if possible, is a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> (or any other bound book), and the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font1"> all on a contribution of one dollar. With each person taking this offer leave a sample copy of the current </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> a book, a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> booklet, and a card bearing the name and address of the hall where the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> studies are held; also a duplicate copy of the subscription slip signed by the publisher, which is the subscriber’s receipt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To persons unable to subscribe for a year, endeavor to place a six-month subscription, on a contribution of 50c, with a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font1">booklet free. With all who so subscribe leave a current issue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> booklet, the address of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">study, and (as the subscriber’s receipt) a duplicate copy of the subscription slip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If a subscription for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> cannot be obtained, then try to place </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> (or any other book) and a Face </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the Facts</span><span class="font1"> booklet, on a contribution of 25c. Where not even this is possible, then leave </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> for anything they can contribute, or even free if they promise to read the booklet. In all homes visited wherein the people show any interest whatsoever we must try to leave at least the Face </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the Facts</span><span class="font1"> booklet—in order, first, that they may have the message, and. second, that we may meet our individual and world-wide quota.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Time the Main Requisite With a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> a Book and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In every’ land throughout the entire world, commencing Sunday, January 1, and continually every day and evening thereafter for four months, till April 30, Jehovah’s faithful remnant and their companions will obediently and enthusiastically march forward in the “hottest” world-wide campaign that has ever been prosecuted by<sup>r</sup> Christians on earth. In Germany and like dark places where God’s true people are cruelly oppressed and hindered in every conceivable way’, they will be united with us to the extent they are able, so that, in reality, all who know of and love the Lord will be found diligently doing with their might what their hands find to do during every hour of this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">Campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign is the most stupendous ever attempted— not merely because within that time, by the Lord’s grace, we confidently expect to have the largest number of publishers in the field, putting in the highest number of hours in field service and back-call work, and placing the largest number of pieces of literature, but for reasons more far-reaching than these. This campaign is going to result in bringing the Watchtower magazine regularly into the homes of at least 100,000 more families, which magazine stresses the great issue of serving Jehovah, the great Theocrat, and live, or serving the cruel dictator Satan and his wicked organization, and die. Also, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font1"> which is going to be read by millions, is sounded the warning. And there arc going to be placed a million bound books which outline Jehovah’s gracious provision for oppressed mankind at this crucial time prior to Armageddon. Thus, this campaign has as its objective the bringing to millions timely facts which they must learn in order to know about Jehovah’s theocratic organization and the course of action they must take now for their protection and safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The publishers must assist the newly interested ones to become “laborers” by showing them just what they can do in advancing this Watchtoicer Campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the last service meeting held in December approximately* </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">70.000</span><span class="font1"> persons, we believe, heard the lecture “Fill the Earth”. Many of these have never gone out into the field, yet they sincerely love the Lord and are anxious to serve Him to the best of their knowledge and ability. What have you done to aid these newly Interested persons to see their priv</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">ileges and responsibilities in this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign? Have you personally invited them to attend the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> studies in your Kingdom hall? Have you arranged for them to regularly receive a copy of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant?</span><span class="font1"> Have you shown them how they can participate in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign by at least going along with you in the witness work or by placing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> booklets among their friends and neighbors and from door to door? Are they reporting regularly? All these things must be done if the witnesses are to discharge their full obligation to the Lord. Not only is it essential that the witnesses themselves do all they can in the field service, but they must also aid the “other sheep” to accompany them in this Kingdom service. Pioneers, particularly, can be very' helpful, because they can start new companies or, if in company territory, take the newly interested to the Kingdom hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the big objectives of this campaign is to have at least 35,000 publishers in the field service. This means an increase of 15 percent over our last peak of publishers. All our records show that this can be and should be exceeded; for there are at this present time 60,000 associated with the companies throughout the United States, and, of this number, 28,000 are regular publishers and 15,000 irregular. If all who have gone out at all in the past witness regularly during this campaign, and if, in addition, even 15 percent of the others who are associated with the companies join with them, we shall easily have 35,000 publishers. The zone servant, the company servant and the other servants of the company must see that the importance of increase in publishers is given consideration at the service meetings from time to time. The newly interested must be ‘built up’, that they may become active and thus enjoy the full favor and protection of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Time in the Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is very essential that each publisher put in much time in the field service each month during this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign. To do so it will be necessary’ to brave the cold winds, snow*, and chilly rains. Yet all who keenly appreciate the importance of the Kingdom issue will overcome these obstacles by properly clothing themselves and taking pains to work the most protected and sheltered portions of their assigned territory. And when the weather is good, full advantage will be taken of it by workins as long as possible, and not being satisfied with putting in three hours, but five and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each morning and each evening</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In every case where people show any willingness to listen, even if at the time you can leave only the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> booklet, try to arrange for a back call with the speeches “Face the Facts”, “Fill the Earth,” and “Fascism or Freedom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Individual Quota</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The “My Daily Kingdom Service” record sheet sets out the quota made for each company publisher and pioneer, which must be met if we are to reach the world-wide quota. This quota for each company publisher is 4 new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscriptions, 20 bound books, and 250 of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> booklet; for each pioneer it is 20 new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">subscriptions, 200 books, and 1,500 of the Face </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font1"> Facts booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Servants of the Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The success of each company In this campaign depends much on the zeal and leadership of its various servants. If each and every one of these servants does his share in the field service and looks after the other interests committed to him, the witness work of the company will be greatly stimulated and advanced. Be sure that the territory is so assigned and worked that your entire assignment will be covered at least once during tne campaign —and twice where possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Make a Good Start</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign begins at a time when most of the publishers can put in full time during the first two days, namely, Sunday, January 1, and Monday, January 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Use New Record “Miracles”, “Instruction” </span><span class="font1">By January 1, it is hoped, all the publishers will each have one of the new records P-153, P-154 to use in the service. We are swamped with orders, and working day and night to get them filled. Run this record at every place possible in your door-to-door work. One side of this disc, “Miracles,” tells about the two speeches of Brother Rutherford from London and why the person should hear them. The other side, &quot;Instruction,” explains why one should read and study </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> Run both of these records, if possible, when you visit the people the first time in the house-to-house work, then try to place the special offer as well as to arrange for a back call. Even if the party refuses to give you a subscription, you may be able to place a book or booklet and arrange an appointment to run “Fascism or Freedom” or “Face the Facts”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another place to uso the new disc, P-153. P-154, is on back calls. Some publishers have already obtained subscriptions by doing this. Those persons on your back-call list who are not yet subscribers for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> should be called on. The record “Instruction” will help you to take their subscription, and “Miracles” will stimulate their interest to hear the new lecture series.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">December 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Article to Be</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Carefully Studied</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The December 1 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> on page 364, In the article “Kingdom Activities”, brings to our attention the importance of devoting more time to the field service. Everyone having in mind the importance of the Kingdom will surely put forth every possible effort to devote at least two hours a day, on the average, to the field service, in obedience to the King's command to preach this gospel of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness. Suggestions are here offered as to how a publisher can put in more time in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">First, publishers should get personal assignments of territory near their homes. Sucli territory can be so situated that it takes in four blocks each way from one’s home. The advantages of getting near-by territory can readily be seen. Persons who have domestic duties to perform can slip out an hour or two each day and do some witnessing work. Practically no time, then, will be spent in traveling to territory. One may find it more convenient to devote an hour or two in the morning; others, two hours in the afternoon. After working in this near-by territory for several days with the phonograph, one will have names and addresses of interested persons to call on when rainy or severe weather makes it almost impossible to go from door to door. On such calls a publisher can spend an hour or an hour and a half, running records, answering questions and assisting the people in Bible study. In the case of married people, the wife can assist the husband to put in more time in the field by witnessing in the territory during the day, finding those who show interest, and turning these names and addresses over to the husband publisher' for back calls an hour or two in the evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Having a local territory, those who get home early from their daily work can put in an hour or two before suppertime. Those persons whose work does not begin until after dinner, because of varying shifts in the industry in which they are employed, can put in a few hours in the morning. Since the 40-hour week is in effect, many factories and offices are closed on Saturdays, giving many of the publishers all day Saturday- off. Considerable of this time could be devoted in field service work, either in local territory or in a witnessing party. Those who have only a half day off from their secular work on Saturday can put in at least three or four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sunday has always been a big day for the publishers, and should continue to be the big day, and bigger, if at all possible, as far as the Kingdom interests are concerned. Many of the publishers are arranging now to put in five to seven hours rather than the usual three, eating lunch in the field. Four to five hours can be spent in door-to-door work, and the remaining time in back calls. Always carry a full set of “Face the Facts”. “Fascism or Freedom” or some other series with you in the car, so that you will have them on hand for back calls in the afternoon. If you have no car. carry a set to your territory and leave it with some interested person, preferably the person on whom you intend to make a back call. In this way you let him know in advance that you intend to be there at an appointed time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The matter of getting time in the field is a matter of personal planning. Jesus emphatically stated that His followers must seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteous-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">January Issue a Stimulus to “Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscribers were pleasantly surprised when they received the January 1 issue. In keeping with the progress of Jehovah’s theocratic government, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> appeared In a new dress. Note the changes that have been made: a new cover in two colors, a revised title, a new scripture text at the head of the “Contents” block, a more vivid picture symbolic of Jehovah’s organization, and—well, we’ll let you see for yourself how many more changes you can find on the cover. On the inside, note the new, larger type, the new kind of paper, the two-color work. But above all, we appreciate the food provided for us ; for we know His children are taught of Jehovah. We are sure that the new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> has been received with joy, and that the publishers are now more eager than ever to present it to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Its new form should aid in getting new subscriptions. Its bright-colored</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Please Use Subscription Blanks</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For some months the brethren were very dependable in the use of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font1">blanks, but in the past few months some have been sending in their subscriptions on almost anything. This, of course, causes extra work in the office. If the brethren, in renewing their subscriptions, will use the renewal blanks that come in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font1">when it is expiring, and send these slips in promptly with an accompanying remittance, they will aid the office greatly. Particularly during the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign stress the importance of using subscription blanks and sending in subscriptions through the company organization, which in turn will list the subscriptions on the transmittal form provided. Your heartily co-operating in this regard will aid the workers in the office, who have all they can do.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Face the Facts</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Foreign Languages</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> can be ordered and will be shipped immediately in any of the languages listed below: Bohemian &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norwegian</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Finnish &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1’ortuguese</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">German &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spanish</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Greek &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swedish</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Italian &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ukrainian ness. The Kingdom must be of paramount importance. There is a tremendous amout of work to be done, and it would be well for all the company organizations in their service meetings to consider this article in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> Everyone should consider this statement: &quot;Some have contented themselves by doing a little service and counting as part of that service the time of riding on streetcars and talking to people. ... ‘If ye love me, keep my commandments’.” All know that the commandment of the Lord is to preach this gospel of the Kingdom, and our proof that we love the Lord will be in finding every way and means of doing this. It is suggested that at your service meetings the publishers point out to one another liow they can put in more time in the field each day, how many ways can be figured out, how many things can be done to put in at least two hours a day, on the average. It will make an interesting service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are going to be busy, but, then, those who are in the Kingdom are the busiest people in the world. Let’s give this matter of more time in the field a lot of serious consideration and, better still, action. cover is significant of the life-giving message of comfort, hope and joy that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> contains. As announced by its new title, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> is truly a “herald of Christ’s kingdom”, and those who would enjoy the benefits under that kingdom must now inform themselves of the message which Jehovah provides for the people of good will through the columns of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another new feature, which we don’t want to overlook and which serves as an aid to the publishers, is the record of “Field Experiences” appearing on the back page. Companies should study and discuss these experiences in their service meetings so that other publishers may improve their own methods of carrying on the Kingdom work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now that Jehovah through his organization has provided this new, attractive form for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font1">let’s show our appreciation by engaging with joy and zeal in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Mail</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Owing to the large number of letters which pioneers failed to mark “Pioneer desk” on envelope, it is necessary to mention again that this oversight causes double handling of these letters, and other loss of time, here at the office. Also, on each letter a pioneer writes to the Society he should give his complete name and full address. Much time here will be saved if the brethren give this necessary information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Coupons</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bundles should be sent insured instead of registered. Borden coupons are not redeemable for cash and should not be included in packets sent ns. Send a post card stating number, kind and value of coupons being sent. Do not inclose this in packages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Health Club coupons are redeemable at .$3.00 per thousand instead of .$4.00 per thousand. Coupons from General Mills, Inc., products, such as Purasnow, Larro, All America and Heliotrope flour, should lie sent direct to them at Box 5000b. Minneapolis, Minn., with request that check be mailed to Watch Toweb for your account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">You Can Help</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When a company servant or unit servant changes his address, he should promptly notify both the Society and the zone servant of this change. When notifying the Society, be sure to show that this change is for your address as company or unit servant; otherwise the address will be changed only on your </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> magazines. It might be well to send a separate notice concerning </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Attending Zone Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The zone and regional servants' reports coming to the office indicate that many of the brethren do not attend the zone assembly on the occasion of the regional servant’s visit. Apparently some do not appreciate the importance of the new organization. Usually such brethren are unable to get effective results in their own territory, and they wonder why. These assemblies are a part of Jehovah's Theocratic Organization for the conduct of his Kingdom service. The instruction provided there is essential for each one in order to properly do the work assigned. Let everyone who possibly can, therefore, attend these assemblies regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Arrange for Full Time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The December 1 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> announces the discontinuance of the Auxiliary branch of the Kingdom service. (See article “Kingdom Activities”.) While many of the auxiliaries enrolled as pioneers on January 1, having made definite arrangements to Increase their time in the work, many more pioneers are needed to properly care for the Kingdom work in the United States at this time. It will be remembered that many previously serving as pioneers are now active as zone servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is much territory that requires the witness. As a result of the world-wide convention in September, with the accompanying </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ra</span><span class="font1">dio broadcasts, many are asking for additional information and instruction. These people must be called on, and there are not sufficient </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">pio</span><span class="font1">neers to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to much isolated territory (in which no company organization exists), a number of small companies throughout the country, composed, in the main, of newly interested persons, require the assistance of live, active pioneers to instruct them and aid them in covering their assigned territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The experience that the auxiliaries have had in the field, taking the lead in using all the instruments the Lord has provided, using </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font1">phonograph consistently, carrying on model studies, making back calls, etc., equips them remarkably </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font1">this work. The great majority of those enrolled as auxiliaries will wish to increase their service to the King and enroll as pioneers. Let us hear from you </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">immediately !</span><span class="font1"> A pioneer application will not be necessary in your case; merely say, &quot;Transfer me from auxiliary to pioneer service.” Company publishers will write for application and information letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some of those already enrolled as pioneers will wish to assist those now entering. Some may have space in their trailers and will welcome a partner in the Kingdom work. We should like to hear from such, advising us just what accommodations they can offer for these new Kingdom pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Messenger</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Due to late orders and a very heavy demand for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font1"> a second edition was put on the press. It is believed that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger </span><span class="font1">will be of real assistance to newly interested persons to appreciate the magnitude of the work done by Jehovah's witnesses. Therefore, extra copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font1"> were printed on the second edition, and will be offered at 5c a copy (remittance to accompany order) when five or more are ordered to one address. These can be placed with the newly interested people at 5c a copy, and we know that they will get a rich blessing from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pecans</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The December </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font1"> had a notice with reference to the sale of pecans to aid pioneers. There seems to have been a misunderstanding about this notice. It is the privilege of anyone to sell his products to anyone he desires, but the purpose of that notice is to inform others that the Society is not either directly or indirectly engaging in selling pecans, and that neither the Society's name nor that of the pioneers in its service should be used to induce others to purchase. To be sure, anyone can buy pecans as he pleases, but this matter should not be connected with contributions to the Society’s pioneers.</span></p>

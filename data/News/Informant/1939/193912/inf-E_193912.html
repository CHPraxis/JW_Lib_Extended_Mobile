<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Government and Peace </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the Month Feature!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The month of December has been designated as “War of Vindication” Testimony Period, and appropriately so; Cor during this month all of .Jehovah’s witnesses will be using their time and faculties in performing a service which will be both pleasing to the Lord and a means of vindicating His name before men. The vindication of Jehovah’s name is the most important doctrine of the Bible. God's Word of truth. All who honestly believe this (and to believe means to obey), will have an opportunity of demonstrating their active belief by obeying the Lord’s command: ’Preach this gospel in all the world for a witness unto all nations.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is no better way to do this than by bringing forcefullj to the attention of the people the information that Jehovah has made available for those who desire his blessings. Such information is contained in the latest publication of the Society, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font2"> which booklet gives the complete text of the memorable speech by that title by Brother Rutherford at Madison Square Garden and, in addition, its companion speech “Victory”, which definitely outlines for us, as well as for all others, our stand for The Theocracy, and Jehovah’s challenge to the Devil and his hosts of wicked servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This month the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font2"> together with two other booklets (colored-cover or self-covered—preferably those with which we are overstocked) should be offered to every person In our territory, each being permitted to make a small contribution of 10c to cover the cost of printing. Those who do not have even a penny to contribute, but desire this ali-im-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>“Model Study” No. 2</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Publishers throughout the country will appreciate the new Model Study question-and-answer series for the later recorded lectures, the same as they did the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font2"> booklet for the “Exposed” and “Religion and Christianity” series.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font2"> is now ready, on all the records from “Safety” to and including the “Government and Peace” series. Questions are provided, the Scriptural references and answers are given, and references made to other publications containing additional material on each lecture. A fine index also appears on the last few leaves of the 64-page booklet, which will help publishers keep in use all of the records which the Society has furnished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every publisher conducting a model study should have several copies of this booklet, and every publisher should be conducting model studies. Therefore everyone will</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Swarm Be 50,000?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">portant message, should be given a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace. </span><span class="font2">Also arrange for a back-call. In your foreign territory be prepared to offer any three booklets on the same contribution, taking advantage of the opportunity of getting out the old large-style booklets if any of these are still on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During this month all publishers engaging in the Kingdom service will also be equipped with the &quot;Snare and Racket” record and run this at every available opportunity, using the doorstep method with the phonograph. Of course, you will have some of the books </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> along with you. Many are inquisitive due to our marches with the “Religion is a snare and a racket” placards, and so the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Neics</span><span class="font2"> No. 5 should be left in every home in your territory so that all may be Informed of the Scriptural proof on the subject. Where the people are not at home, it would be well to call back on them some evening, and remind them that a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font2"> was left and that you have additional information along that line, and offer to play the “Snare and Racket” record for them. This can easily be arranged where one holds individual territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">December, “War of Vindication” Testimony Period, should be the best booklet month ever, because more publishers are in the field in the United States. Be sure that every effort is made in each company to ‘swarm the locusts’ for this “War of Vindication”. Will there be an “army” of 50,000 publishers? Five Saturdays and five Sundays, as well as the added “holidays”, will enable those who are engaged in secular work to devote much time in the Kingdom service during this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">need the booklet. As large quantities are not printed of this publication, they are 5c a copy to everyone.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Did Your October Report Show an Increase?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Thrilling beyond words is the majestic onward march of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government The evidences of the Lord’s favor on his organization are multiplying daily. That the “other sheep&quot; are taking their stand on tlie side of the King is clearly seen in each month’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the month of October 45,200 joyful Kingdom publishers, which includes the pioneers and company publishers in the U.S.A, and outlying countries reporting to the Brooklyn office, participated in the Lord’s strange work; an increase of 12,471 over October a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord describes his people today as warriors in battle array and as locusts overrunning the land, an army that cannot be stopped or turned aside. Olliers, who have neither the joy nor the love of the Lord, are frightened and intimidated by the enemy and turned aside because of adverse weather conditions or things of that nature; but not so with the warriors of the Lord. Instead of looking for a falling-off because of the severity of the winter weather, we confidently look forward to a definite increase in number of publishers each month and to attaining the 50,000 quota very early In the fiscal year 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Kingdom is on the increase, and nothing can stop it. Not only did</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">It would be well for all company organizations to have two or three extra copies of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font2"> on their shelves so that when the newly interested come to the meetings and want to know more about the Society you may offer them a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 50c.

<p><span class="font2">Very impressive is the picture on this year’s Calendar, which on careful consideration gives the observer much to think about. The year’s text, “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation,” is one directly connected with our work at the present time, the privilege we have of distributing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> book, that all the people of good will may do as this text sets out.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">the month of October show an excellent increase in publishers, but there was also a very fine increase in the average number of hours per publisher. The company publishers in the United States increased from an average of 13.1 hours per publisher last October to 19.1 hours per publisher this year; practically a fiftypercent increase. This marks a definite stride toward our quota of 60 hours a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This increase in the average of hours [ier publisher for the month of October also explodes the theory of some who contend that increase in number of publishers means a decrease in average of hours. The Lord says that ‘his people shall be willing in the day of his power’. The Jonadabs enter into the work now with a fire and zeal for Jehovah and his kingdom that is Irresistible, and with them “time&quot; means something to be used to tlie glory of the Lord and the advancement of the Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January a Bound-Book Month </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Ready? Have You Supplies?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Most Unusual!</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>3 Bound Books on a 35c Contribution</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">To follow the December campaign, “War of Vindication,” the Society has arranged for a wide distribution of bound books in January, 1940. These will be placed on a contribution of 35c for any three of the Society's bound books from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font2"> to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font2"> inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren will recall our experience last year in the distribution of the three books </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> on a similar contribution. Let us profit by the experiences of that campaign. At that time almost all companies and pioneers underestimated the result of the campaign (many of them running out of their </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> stock before the campaign was half over; others, when it was two-thirds over), and very few of them had enough stock on hand to last them until the end of the campaign. There were many contributing causes which are familiar to the brethren and servants in each company ; therefore all should watch and see to it that they do not make the same mistake again. To do so would show negligence and indifference toward the Kingdom interests committed into our care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To the enlightened child of God it is clearly evident (from the ballyhoo in the press, on the radio, and from the religious and political pulpiteers everywhere) that the people are perishing, not for bread or for water, but for the hearing of the word of the Lord. The books we have to offer to the people contain Jehovah’s life-giving food for a perishing world. We are obligated before the Lord to raise up a standard for the people, and, at the contribution on which this combination is offered, the Lord has made it possible for practically everyone to obtain at least one combination. Let us, therefore, by the Lord’s grace, accept this grave responsibility whicli Jehovah has placed upon us and go forward with zeal and thanksgiving carrying this life-giving food to a perishing world during this campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All of the Society’s bound books from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font2"> to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah </span><span class="font2">may be offered during this period, 3 on a contribution of 35c, 6 on 70c contribution, 12 on $1.40 contribution, etc. Foreign-language books are also to be used in this campaign ; any 3 to be offered on a contribution of 40c, 6 on 80c contribution, etc. Note that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font2">are not to be included in this combination offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The enemy is closing down on the Lord’s work throughout the earth. In America we still have the privilege of service. Let us, therefore, work ‘while it is day ; for the night cometh, when no one will be able to work’. Each individual publisher, each company servant, zone servant, and regional servant, should start planning and preparing for this campaign now, each in his respective position seeing that every necessary detail is taken care of. Pioneers also, in their field, are to participate in this campaign, so that on January 1 the entire organization will roll into action as one man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We learned from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">Campaign, last January to April, that if an offer is attractive enough and is presented with zeal and conviction the people will take it. Therefore there should be no backwardness or timidity about presenting a 35c combination to the people, but it should be done with the conviction that what you have to offer to them is far more valuable than any amount of money they could possibly contribute for It.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the much-underestimated </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> campaign last December we placed 290,516 bound books. With proper advance planning and preparation, with from 10.000 to 15,000 more publishers in the field all averaging about 6 hours more each month, it would not surprise us if that figure were almost doubled this year. “According to your faith be it unto you.” Let each one do his part with faith and confidence, and the Lord will give the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Details</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On November 13 the Society sent a letter to each company and zone servant regarding this campaign. This letter should be read to the company. In addition to other things, it contains a basis for carrying on this campaign. The following figures are recommended: 12 bound books for each company publisher. That amounts to one combination a week for the month. This is a very reasonable expectation and should be attained without difficulty. This estimate applies to all companies, large and small. Detailed instructions regarding the manner of obtaining the stock, and other details, were also contained in this letter of November 13. The instructions therein should be followed out carefully by all the servants. In addition, the company servant is responsible for cheeking up at the last service meeting in December, seeing to it that each publisher has the required combinations, territory and other details arranged for, so that all can start right into the work at the beginning of the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During this period individual territory adjacent to the publishers’ homes is particularly recommended, and, for group work, territory in the vicinity of each study group. The study conductors should arrange to take tlie study group out at least once each week in this territory in addition to the individual witnessing done by the brethren themselves. By working such convenient territory repeated back-calls can be made at any time on those who obtain the literature and manifest interest. Arrange for back-calls on each one obtaining a combination. The real purpose behind leaving the literature with the people is to have them read it. Therefore, call back and see how they are progressing, and show an interest in assisting them, and the advantage of having a model study. Arrange for such model studies. In fact, the procedure should be that at each door where the publisher comes there is a prospective obtainer for the combination; each obtainer is a prospect for a back-call ; each back-call is a prospect for a model study; and each attendant at the model study should be viewed as a prospective active publisher and should be invited to the company meetings as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The back-call servant should see to it that all interested ones on his files are called upon with this special offer. This is a work that new publishers can participate in without difficulty. Assign some names to them. The people they call upon are acquainted with the work, in sympathy with it, and will receive them gladly. The person should be given the advantage of this special offer because of previous interest.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>How Companies Are to Get Their Books and Rebate</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">As set forth in detail in our letter of November 13, the companies with insufficient stock are to get the books they need from any near-by company which has an oversupply. This should be done at once, and the Society should be notified of such transactions on the regular Transfer of Stock blanks, which blanks are to be duly signed by the respective company servants. The blanks are then to be sent in to the Society and an adjustment will be made on your accounts. Only one blank is to be sent in covering each transaction; do not send in two notices about the same transfer: otherwise, duplicate charge and credit will be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, if there is no company near by to supply the books needed, then send in your order immediately to the Society for the “total quantity of books” needed. That is, say, order 120 books, and leave it up to us to send you whatever books we find it</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Pioneers’ Part in the January Campaign</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Many of the pioneers during the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> campaign barely got going before they had to stop, due to the fact that they didn’t supply themselves with sufficient </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> or that they got started too late. Notwithstanding all this the pioneers averaged 53 books each during that campaign. Knowing that there are sufficient books for all, and looking forward to the pioneers’ starting January 1, we strongly urge the pioneers to immediately check their stock and send in their orders to the Society for what additional books will be needed. Surely it is reasonable to expect the pioneers to average at least one combination of three books a day. You should order accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers should send in their orders as soon as possible after receiving this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> Where there are two or more pioneers working in the same city, they should arrange to send in their orders together, in the same envelope, with instructions to send the orders to one address. Also, for this book campaign only, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WE REQUEST PIONEERS TO ORDER THE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Elderly brethren who are physically unable to carry a number of bound books may take along one bound book and a catalog; show the bound book and use the catalog to demonstrate the others. In fact, all publishers should carry a catalog with them, so they will have something with which to demonstrate if they run out of books. Also, each publisher should have a supply of booklets, particularly self-covered booklets, to offer and leave with those who manifest interest but who cannot afford to take the combination of bound books. A bookmark with the local address should be left with each combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We fully believe that the 45,000 publishers in the field during October will continue throughout the winter and will joyfully participate in this campaign during January. Prepare now for bad weather and such other difficulties as you may reasonably expect to encounter. Put in as many hours as you possibly can, which is the one way we can prove our love for Jehovah and the Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “Snare and Racket” record will be used to introduce the combination. The fact that the record mentions </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font2">should be no detriment to Its effectiveness. The publisher can briefly explain this exceptional special offer that we are making during January in addition to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> which may be obtained, if desired, each on a 25c contribution. convenient to ship to you from the nearest company or depot. Of course, if the company has broken sets of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> books, you should order specifically such books and quantities as you need to match your sets. Whatever you do, be sure to order plenty of books and to send in your order without any further delay. It should be on the way now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A rebate of 25c a set (of three books, English or foreign) will be given to each company for the sets placed and properly reported on the January field service report card. At the bottom of the company’s January report card show the total number of sets of three books placed; 6 books placed, 9 books, and 12 books, placed.

Each day the publisher engages in the service he should make out a Publisher’s Field Service Report slip, showing on the bottom of the report slip the number of 3-book combinations placed at 35c. The publisher is to turn in these reports to the stockkeeper or treasurer, who in turn will give the publisher a rebate of 25c (either in cash or in literature) for each set of 3 books reported placed. Each report slip so handled is to be signed by either the stockkeeper or the treasurer, to show that a rebate has been made. These report slips are to be kept on file for two months or until such time as it seems certain all the publishers are satisfied they have received proper rebate for the sets placed and reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The company will be reimbursed for such rebates by credit on its account. The sets reported placed, and shown on tlie bottom of the company’s January report card Io this office, will determine the credit allowed.</span></p>

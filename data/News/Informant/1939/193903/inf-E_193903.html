<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>New Booklet by Brother Rutherford Released April 1</span></h2>

<p><span class="font1">Jehovah continuously provides his people with new instruments of war, which they use in their fight against the Devil and his organization. These instruments are very powerful and effective in exposing the racket of religion, and also aid Jehovah’s witnesses in magnifying the name of the Almighty and in proving their integrity under adverse conditions. This time the new instrument is a 64-page booklet entitled “Fascism or Freedom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many have been wondering when the lecture by Brother Rutherford, delivered October 2, 1938, over a nation-wide chain, would be put in print for world-wide distribution. It is here! This booklet contains that stirring talk and also another timely message by Brother Rutherford under the heading &quot;Theocracy”, which is Important for the people of good will to have and study. We know this new booklet will be received with much joy by all of the Lord’s people. It is full of fight, and its distribution will cause much added pain to the religionists and their allies. The facts are presented so that the people may choose which they will serve: the monstrosity which is championing the Devil’s cause in the earth, or the Kingdom of God under Christ. Upon that choice depends their eternal destiny; hence this message must be put in the hands of millions of people. Are you ready to do your part?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">10,000,000 First Printing</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The presses at the Watch Toweb plant at Brooklyn are already printing this booklet. They are working day and night to get ready the millions of copies that will be required. Initial shipments are already on the way to Australia, South Africa, India, and other distant points, and more will follow to every Englishspeaking country on the globe. Ten million copies of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font1"> are being printed, and we hope that many more will be needed. We expect that this booklet will go like wildfire among the public. The title alone will arouse interest and a desire to read, because it is an issue that confronts every person in the world. The picture on the cover will further aid in placing the booklet. On one side is a prisoner, held in restraint by representatives of the totalitarian powers, chief among which is the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. On the other side, in striking contrast, is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, unrestrained, joyfully exhibiting the message of the Kingdom for the consideration of all who desire freedom. A glance at this picture should create an immediate desire to read the contents of the booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“New Heavens” Testimony Period</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font1"> is to be released to the public on April 1, the beginning of the “New Heavens” Testimony Period. That does not</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">mean that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign is to cease at that time, but the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font1"> is to be included with the offer of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font1"> a bound book and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> magazine. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign started in dead earnest on January 1, and it has been gathering momentum ever since. The enthusiasm of the publishers has increased from week to week, and now thousands of new subscriptions for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font1">are pouring into the office. With this new, timely booklet to add to the special offer, the zeal and joy of the Kingdom publishers should know no bounds, and the “New Heavens” Testimony Period should be the greatest we have had to date. It is during that time that the anointed will celebrate the Memorial, and their joy can be complete only by sharing in the Kingdom witness. They, as well as the Jonadabs, fully appreciate the fact that the “new heavens” are in operation, and they eagerly serve under Jehovah’s Theocratic Government. It is also during the month of April that we expect a new peak in publishers, at least 35,000, and, we hope, many more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Offer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Beginning April 1, the following will be the offer: (1) A year’s subscription for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> at the regular rate, with a bound book and two booklets. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font1"> free as a special premium. This will be an added inducement for persons to subscribe for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> Never before has the Watch Toweb made such a remarkable offer. (2) Those who cannot subscribe for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> will be offered a bound book and the two booklets, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of 25c. (3) Persons failing to take either of the above will be offered the two booklets </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font1"> on a contribution of 5c or whatever contribution they wish to make.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Vindication</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Goes Well</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1">The reports of the pioneers and companies for the month of December are very gratifying. These reports indicate that the publishers are putting forth real effort in the field, and show what can be accomplished when everyone works in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those people who are really interested but too poor to obtain any literature should be left one booklet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font1"> free. Take the names and addresses of such persons for back calls, and when you call back leave the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font1"> and, if the interest warrants it, a copy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> This should greatly increase back-call activity and result in many new subscriptions. On these back calls point out to the people the need of their hearing all of the recorded lectures and make regular appointments. Invite them to your Kingdom hall to hear the weekly series, which should be running there regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Point out the need of their studying </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font1">If they cannot subscribe for a year or six months, they can obtain at the hall each new copy as it comes out twice a month at 5e a copy. Always have in mind the importance of these people’s learning the truth, studying it, and sooner or later having a share in saying “Come”. Do not take 3-month subscriptions for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> They must be for 6 months or a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Consignments</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To each company in the United States there will be consigned approximately 150 booklets for each publisher. All pioneers should immediately order the quantities they desire to distribute within the next several months. This booklet will be distributed not only during the “New Heavens” Testimony Period, but for several months thereafter. The importance of its message along with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> makes it imperative that this booklet be included in the last month of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign. The cost to companies and pioneers of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font1"> is the same as that of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> booklet. This low rate, we hope, will aid the publishers in distributing millions of copies more than they ordinarily would.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">unity. December, the “Faithful and True” Testimony Period, was devoted to the distribution of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> books. Prior to the December campaign the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> books had been moving rather slowly; there were thousands of them in stock of the companies and at Brook-</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>More Publishers Needed for “New Heavens”</span><br><br><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Testimony Period</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">In another place in this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> you will see that, on the average, 30,887 publishers have been active in the field for three months of this year. That is remarkable. Only the Lord could accomplish this through his own Theocratic Government. What will January bring? February? March? April? These are questions in which we are all interested. In this respect very serious consideration should be given to Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 1. Our quota of 35,000 publishers should be met within a few months and be well surpassed with the “New Heavens” Testimony Period in April. There are thousands of newly interested now attending the model study meetings, and these should soon be proclaiming the Kingdom message and sharing particularly in the distribution of this new booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom. </span><span class="font1">Their protection and preservation depend upon their faithfulness to the Lord. Point out to these newly interested people the great privilege that is theirs of taking part in the Kingdom service. Suggest to them taking 25 or 50 copies of this booklet, distributing them and making report of the same to the company as a publisher. Help them to become publishers of the Kingdom. Remember the 15-percent increase. Every company in the country should look well to its organization, and to assisting its new publishers in the distribution of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> the bound books, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah’s organization is carrying on a great onslaught against the Devil and his crowd; and while we meet intense opposition in the field, we know that ‘they shall not prevail against us’, for ‘the battle is God’s’. Let’s keep on with this mighty work, grateful for this added feature to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">lyn, and many felt that they could never be placed. However, with the announcement that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font1">books would be stressed during December, all the publishers for the Kingdom made ready to put these out. As soon as the campaign started, many companies and pioneers began to realize that they had far underestimated the number of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font1">they would place, and telegrams and air-mail and special delivery letters began to pour into Brooklyn for more </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font1"> books. By the middle of December many companies were completely out of stock, and there were no more to be had. Then special efforts were made with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font1"> and other bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now that all the reports for December are in and compiled, the total result is beyond our greatest expectation. In that one month 290,516 bound books were placed, which was a new high for bound</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font1"> 2, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">column</span><span class="font1"> 4)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>'Come, and Say “Come”’</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">A person of good will writes that for twenty years he had been reading the Watch Toweb literature, and, although he had spoken numerous times to Jehovah’s witnesses calling at his door, “no one,” he says, “ever asked me to attend a meeting. You may be surprised, but still that Is a true statement. I wondered If one would be welcome to go to their meeting places.” This Jona-dab finally got to a meeting under his own power and forwardness, but even after attending a meeting he was still doubtful whether he was welcome, because of the absence of a cordial welcome and of a seeming lack of Interest by the brethren in his association with the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Attention is called to this letter to emphasize the point that not only should all people of good will be Invited to attend our meetings, but when they do come they should be made welcome. Talk to them and make them feel at home, and show that you are glad they came. Advertise your Kingdom Hall meetings. We should say “Come” to the people of good will, so that they may drink of the life-giving waters of truth, and so that those who hear may also say “Come”. Let the people of good will know where you meet, and make them welcome when they do come.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Unexcelled! Wonderful Start for New Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">30,887 Publishers, Monthly Average</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Back Calls Yielding Fruit</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The three-month report, October, November and December, 1938, set out herewith and compared with the same period of last year, brings much joy to our hearts. The outstanding feature is that almost 7,000 more publishers engaged In the service this year than last. With this wonderful start, our quota of 35,000 publishers should easily be made by April if everyone directs his efforts toward that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Other gratifying figures: 218,583 back calls were made this year, to compare with 20,929 last year. The splendid increase in publishers this year is undoubtedly due in part to the great Increase in back calls. But there is still a lot of room for improvement. Remember, our quota is one back call a week per publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The publishers, all together, put in nearly 300,000 more hours in the field service in this period, compared with last year. That is a fine increase, but, with the 60-hour a month goal set in Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 1, the work done In the field during the next three months will probably surpass these figures, even though It is in the dead of winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Books and booklets are coming along fine. New subscriptions were not so high, but this will be made up for in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign. The sound attendance reported shows that the people are listening.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow Up Expired Subscriptions Sent You</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Splendid results have been ob-talned In following up </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> names sent out by the Society. One zone servant reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“We had a three-day campaign with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consoles tion</span><span class="font1"> names sent from Brooklyn. The workers reported 120 back calls, 6 new model studies and 35 new subscriptions. The friends are greatly enthused.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another effective means of developing the Kingdom interests Is reported in the following experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“An advertising campaign to set </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> before the public was suggested. Among other things, “sandwich parades” were inaugurated to advertise the public meeting, and 65 participated in the parade. It was a great success. Each parader carried 25 or more booklets. One thousand were placed with shoppers, many of whom gladly contributed. The time was from 2:30 to 4:00 p.m., and the route was through the busy downtown section. Two sound cars accompanied the parade, giving a musical background and verbal announcements as well as picking up the tired paraders. The cars could have supplied more booklets if required. The youngest in the parade was 8, and the oldest was 79. Both went all the way.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Miracles” Record and Its Use</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>The Doorstep Setup with the Phonograph</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In Door-to-Door Work, Back Calls and Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The “Miracles” record has been greatly appreciated by the publishers in their activity with the phonograph, both in door-to-door work and in back-call service. It should also be used at public meetings to introduce the London lectures “Face the Facts” and “Fill the Earth”. In the Society’s letter of October 20, entitled “Turn on the Heat”, the statement was made that before running the London speeches the people should have pointed out to them the conditions under which those recordings were made and some of the details relative to the big meeting at London and the shortwave transmission. Now that the “Miracles” record has been made, however, the chairman of the meeting need no longer make this explanation. “Miracles” sets out these details clearly and forcefully, and it should be run at the meeting as an Introduction to the lecture. Use “Miracles” to Introduce the London lectures at all public meetings that the companies and pioneers are now arranging, in schoolhouses, clubhouses, private homes, auditoriums, or any other place where people assemble to hear these lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To Introduce the lecture “Fascism or Freedom” at public meetings, it is suggested that the chairman read the following announcement (or state it in his own words) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">‘The lecture which you are about to hear by electrical transcription is an exact reproduction of Judge Rutherford’s speech “Fascism or Freedom” delivered at the Mecca Temple, New York city, on October 2, 1938, before an audience of 7,000 people that packed out the auditorium. The lecture was broadcast simultaneously over a nationwide radio chain and carried by direct wire to audiences assembled In halls throughout the United States and Canada. The message contained in that lecture is so important that it is being reproduced in meetings such as this one for the people throughout America, Australia, Great Britain, Africa, in fact,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In every country where the English language is spoken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Today a foreign power threatens all democracies of the earth. In this country determined efforts are now being made to set up a dictator who will rule the people by force. When that time comes the people will be regimented, their liberties taken away, and all freedom of thought and action destroyed. The newspapers are well aware of the efforts now being made by that foreign power to grab control of this country, but because of fear they withhold the facts and fall to warn the people. Listen now to an authoritative speech by Judge Rutherford as to whether the world shall be ruled by Fascists or by Jehovah through His King, Christ Jesus.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Instruction</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Record P-154, “Instruction,” contains a splendid introduction to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> magazine. Reports from the publishers on the use of this record are very encouraging, showing that this short talk by Brother Rutherford is a great aid in obtaining subscriptions for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> Publishers with phonographs who do not already have the record P-153,154 (“Miracles”, “Instruction”) should obtain it immediately</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial Celebration April 4</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Send in Attendance on Monthly Card</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each year it is the pleasure of the anointed remnant to celebrate the Memorial. As announced in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> it will be held April 4, after 6 p.m. On that evening all the anointed throughout the world will partake of the unleavened bread and drink real red wine, which are the emblems used at the Memorial Supper. In companies where the servants are Jonadabs, they should see to it that proper provisions are made for this service by providing for and announcing the place of assembly and providing the bread and wine. Their service ceases there, however. One of the anointed should</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Avoids Difficulty of Getting Inside</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many people refuse to allow publishers to come inside to run the phonograph, because of prejudice, fear of strangers, a feeling that they are going to be asked to buy something, or because It is just inconvenient at the time to allow publishers to come in. To get around these difficulties we recommend the doorstep method, which is being used quite successfully in England, Scotland and other countries. This same method has recently been inaugurated in some places in the United States and is going well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the doorstep method the publisher, before knocking at the door, has the phonograph wound up ready for operation, the record in place and the needle ready to set on the disc. All preparation is made in advance, and when the party comes to the door the publisher does not waste time by asking if he may come to use throughout the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">Campaign. It is essential that it be used at every opportunity in door-to-door witnessing as well as on back calls. “Instruction” will help you obtain </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoiver</span><span class="font1"> subscriptions, and “Miracles” will arrange your back calls for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">conduct the service and serve the emblems. The Jonadabs are welcome and should attend this service. The company servant is to report the total attendance, and the number who partake of the emblems, on his regular April report card to the Society and to the zone servant. Pioneers attending the Memorial with companies should make no report on their cards, but Isolated pioneers should make this notation. Where two or more isolated brethren celebrate the Memorial together, only one pioneer need report this on his card. Use the following method in reporting:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Memorial attendance............</span></p>

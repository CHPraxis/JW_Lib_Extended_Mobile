<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Publisher, Have You Made Your Quota?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>One Month Gone!</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Will It Be 40,000 Publishers?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah, the great Theocrat, is the righteous One. He commands those who serve him to walk in the way of righteousness, to fear him only, and to hate evil and evildoers. Because of the great monstrosity now in the earth the “lovers Of righteousness” must boldly and unceasingly advocate and proclaim the kingdom of God under Christ the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Are you one of the “lovers of righteousness”? Do you appreciate the deadly conflict between the monstrosity and the Kingdom? Are you convinced that Jehovah and his kingdom under Christ will come through victorious, and that soon? If so, you will then wholeheartedly engage in the “strange work” which Jehovah is performing now. As forcibly set forth in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">article “Kingdom Activities”, you will henceforth no longer be satisfied with putting in 15 to 20 hours a month In the field service, but will do as much more as you possibly can; In fact, your goal should now be two hours a day, or sixty a month 1 Make it your first business to reach your goal during the special period of February, a month in which all “lovers of righteousness” should be found daily doing their utmost towards making the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign a real success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Individual Territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">February Is one of the most treacherous months of the year, the weather usually being so unsettled and inclement that in order for the publishers to fully use every available hour they must witness in territory close to their homes and in apartments. During the winter months at least, each publisher should be assigned to a territory of reasonable size around his home or to a territory that is quickly accessible and is so sheltered that It can be worked during poor weather. Large-group witnessing is not so practical during the winter months; the groups could be restricted to parties of 4 to 10, and the territory to be witnessed by each group should be such as can be gone back to for several successive weeks so as to take full advantage of the good-will Interest found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In assigning individual territory to the average publisher, the territory servant should assign approximately 4 blocks each way around the home of the publisher, or 16 blocks In all; in the case of publishers who cannot possibly get around much, because of old age or ill health, the assignment should be proportionately smaller. The company servant and territory servant are hereby authorized to make such Individual territory assignment (of company territory only) regardless of who may be holding the territory at present, whether a special pioneer, pioneer, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">or another company publisher. Of </span><span class="font2">course, in making such assignment the one now holding the territory should be properly notified of such change in assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Individual territory around one’s home has many obvious benefits. It enables the publisher to be immediately in his territory on leaving home, to work much more frequently, get much more time in the service, and obtain and properly care for many more back calls. This is especially true of housewives, who, by careful planning, can average two hours a day in the field—an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon or evening. Such an arrangement also means that if it is raining very hard or is very stormy during the first part of the day immediate advantage can be taken of any letup, or, by just bundling up, a back call can be made on someone near by who under the circumstances has time on his hands and would welcome a caller bringing good news. In most cases the publishers will find such individual territory around their homes to be so helpful that they will want to hold the assignment permanently, and the territory servant should let the publisher keep the assignment, provided it is being witnessed to at least four or more times a year and report Is made each three months and reassignment received. Where two or more publishers live near each other, they should each be assigned territory near by. They should not depend on one another for territory, though they may regularly work together when convenient; oftentimes one can witness while the others cannot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back Calls Highly Important</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is principally through the same publisher’s continually calling on the people of good will that they become enlightened and encouraged to attend the regular established meetings of the company and In due course themselves become regular publishers. This must be our primary objective in making back calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Back calls can be obtained in various ways and made at all times. It is through the running of the phonograph records that most of them are now made, but many back calls can be arranged by simply taking down the address of persons who took literature and responded favorably to the witness. These persons can be called on a week later, by the publisher who placed the literature, to see what progress was made in reading the literature, thus often enabling the publisher to run a recording or two and to arrange for a back call. Such names should never be turned In as back-call prospects for others to call on, however. Also, there is the method of leaving with two or more of your neighbors or business associates a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font2">booklet free on the condition that you will call a week later, at a set </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">time, to pick up this literature, and </span><span class="font2">then find out just how much interest was aroused. Such return visits often result in arrangements for further back calls and even subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> We emphasize the importance of leaving a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> with each one on whom you are going to make a back call. Further, now that the companies have received the names and addresses of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> subscribers In their territory, back calls on these people are to be made at the earliest moment possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A very opportune time to arrange for and to make back calls is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">after </span><span class="font2">witnessing three to five hours on Saturday and Sunday. By doing this the publisher can put in an extra two or three hours in the service, and that without unduly tiring oneself. But to do this, one must work in the same territory week in and week out; one cannot witness hither and thither and expect to get the best results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Stress the Entire Combination</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To place the special offer of a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> a bound book, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> booklet, It is necessary to bring this entire offer to the attention of the people as quickly as possible. When one gets in with the phonograph this is easy to do. But also at the homes where one cannot run the recordings the publishers need to show the entire offer. Do not just merely offer the booklet, or even the book and booklet, because a person does not Invite you in and fails to show particular interest at the start. Let the people see the entire combination, and it will be found that in a good number of instances it will be accepted just as readily as a book and booklet. At least this prepares the people for your next visit. This, of course, means that you must have a copy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> a book and a booklet handy to present to the people at the door. Some do this by carrying their literature in a zipper or convenient handbag which permits them to show the combination at a moment’s notice; others keep the combination under their arm or in their overcoat pockets—the vital thing being that, having the combination handy, it encourages and does help the publishers to present it to many more people than it is possible otherwise. Stress this feature of the work at your service meetings, having both the brothers and sisters who are successful in this demonstrate how they are doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Making Your Quota?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to be up with the quota set for each company publisher for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign, each one should have put in sufficient time during January to have distributed by the end of that month 62 booklets and 5 bound books and obtained 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscription. Pioneers and special pioneers should in that same period of time have placed 375 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">booklets and 50 books and secured </span><span class="font2">5 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions. Have you done this? Is your company as a whole making its quota? If not. start planning now to make up this deficit during February, so that by the half-way mark, by February 28, you will have reached half of your </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign quota. Profit from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font2"> campaign by meeting your quota month by month, and not wait till the last few days of the campaign to put on a ‘big splurge’. Each company should keep its “thermometer” chart up to date weekly, while individual publishers should dally keep up the “My Dally Kingdom Service” record sheet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">40,000 Publishers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Both Brother Rutherford’s letter and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> have just very pointedly brought to the attention of the remnant and their associates the fact that we are living in the most important time that men have ever lived; that now it is absolutely necessary for each “lover of righteousness” to obediently carry out Jehovah’s commandment to &quot;warn them from me”. Read carefully Ezekiel 33:1-19 as Instructed. This friendly and timely admonition should spur each one of us to the realization of the need of putting forth much greater activity than ever before. Company and zone servants should particularly encourage all the ones now associated with the companies to take some active part in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign, even if it is only putting out </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> booklets. There is something very important that everyone can do towards advancing the interests of the Kingdom, and each one should see that he is busily doing his share. Each one must do his own part; no one can substitute for another. During February we hope to see 40,000 warriors in the field! Will you be one of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">February 13 and 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These are two days when most people are free from secular employment and when they are free to do the things they enjoy most. Jehovah’s witnesses and their associates will devote the major portion of these two days to honoring and magnifying the name and word of their God. All-day witnessing arrangements should be made by each company for these two days, with special plans being arranged for the three days of February 11-13. Company servants should see that every publisher is well supplied with literature and territory; and the publishers, in turn, should co-operate by putting in all the time possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Try to leave a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">FACE THE FACTS </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">booklet in</span><span class="font2"> EVERY </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">home!</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>It Should Greatly Increase</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> article of December 1, 1938, on “Kingdom Activities”, and Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 1, 1939, bring to the attention of the Lord’s people everywhere the responsibility resting upon those who have taken their stand on the Lord's side and the need of being diligent in maintaining their Integrity before the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In arriving at your quota of field hours for the year 1939 and subsequent years, the brethren in each company should carefully and prayerfully study the foregoing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> article and letter by Brother Rutherford, and at the conclusion of the study have blank slips passed around to all the brethren in the company. Each publisher in the company will place on that slip the number of hours he feels he can devote to the field service each month, by the Lord’s grace. These slips will then be collected, added up and multiplied by twelve. This will constitute the company’s quota for the year. Absent brethren, too, should be supplied with slips, so that they also may contribute their portion toward the quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Back-call quota will still be based on one back call a week per publisher.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Proper Record of New Interest</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The Organization Instructions provide that all companies shall keep a list of all interested persons, including </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> subscribers. This means that, during the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign, and, in fact, at all times, an accurate report should be made of all interested ones met in the field, and especially those who become subscribers, so that a complete record may be had at the company headquarters. If, when you meet someone who is of good will, you desire to make the back calls yourself (and this should be done, if at all possible), turn in a “Back Call” slip to the back call servant, showing thereon that you are making calls and will report progress. If you cannot make the back calls, no notation will be necessary. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">This applies to all publishers, whether company, pioneer or special pioneer.</span><span class="font2"> It should always be kept in mind that the good-will interest is to be tied in with the company organization. I’ublishers are not to keep names in their personal files, but should also report them to the back call servant. If this interest is properly cared for. they must be called on regularly. These people will be taking their stand in Jehovah’s army of witnesses and will not need calling on indefinitely, but will become active publishers themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When isolated county territory is released by pioneers, the names of those who showed definite interest should always be listed on the county report.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Japanese Records</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">There is now available in the Japanese language the record PJ-101, PJ-102, “Value of Knowledge” and “Riches”. Companies that have Japanese people in their territory will find these records of considerable help. They are 70c each ; six for $3.50.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Unity of Action</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">All company servants will please co-operate by promptly sending to your zone servant a copy of your monthly field activity report as advised in the Organization Instructions. Please do this, so that they in turn may render their proper reports to the Society.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Have You Read and Studied Letter of January 1?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">On January 1, a letter written by Brother Rutherford and addressed “To All the Kingdom Publishers” was sent to every company in the land. Have you received that letter and given it careful consideration at your service meetings? If not, do so immediately. According to instructions on the letter, it should have been read two or more times at meetings when aH the publishers and others associated with the company were present. If there are any who have not heard this letter read, the company servant should see that such have an opportunity to read and consider it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brother Rutherford points out that there are a number of persons associated with the companies who are not active in the service. As stated in the January </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, </span><span class="font2">our records show that there are, ail together, more than 60.000 persons associated with the companies throughout the country, and of these there are only 28.000 regular publishers and 15.000 irregular. That means that there must be 17,000 persons who do not engage in the service at all, and many others who do so only halfheartedly. Surely</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">World-wide Report for October</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Great Gain over</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>58,117 Publishers in Field During “Jehovah’s Battle”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The world-wide report for “Jehovah's Battle” Testimony Period, which embraced the entire month of October, 1938, shows a marvelous increase over the corresponding month in 1937. You will note from the summary set out here that there has been an increase in everything except bound books. Of particular interest is the fact that 58,117 publishers were out in the field, an increase of nearly 10,000 over a year ago. These publishers distributed 2,829,886 pieces of literature, put in 1.207,367 hours of service, ran the phonograph records with the Kingdom message for 1,944,666 persons, and made 99.132 back calls. That is a splendid showing for the first month of the new fiscal year, and we hope the Increase continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The reports from every country show that the brethren are filled with zeal for the Kingdom and. strengthened by the recent worldwide convention, are pressing forward in the fight against God’s enemies. Now, witli the two speeches of that convention, as well as “Fascism or Freedom” in record</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Back Calls and Model Studies</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Follow Up the New Interest</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Every company, large or small, should have a service meeting devoted to new interest and back calls. Publishers recognize that the brother conducting a model study in the hall should properly prepare himself in advance. Each one making a back call and conducting a model study should be just as thoroughly equipped to handle that meeting as a chairman of a study at the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, none should be discouraged and refuse to conduct model studies because of feeling incapable. Anyone who has sufficient knowledge of the truth, sees the ford’s letter such persons will want to become regular, active publishers for the Kingdom. Each one of the consecrated must bear witness to the Kingdom and warn the people so that they may ‘turn from their wickedness’ and escape the sword of Jehovah’s Executioner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our goal for January has been set at 35,000 publishers. That is a small number, when we consider the fact that there are 60,000 persons in the country who attend meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses. Let each one seriously consider this matter, and then make arrangements to have part In the campaign now in progress. Active publishers can help those who want to start out, by taking them into the field, showing them how the work is done and otherwise assisting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As stated in Brother Rutherford’s letter, this is the most important time that men have ever lived. God’s kingdom, promised more than six thousand years ago, has come and there is to be a complete change from wicked rule to righteousness. Only those who love righteousness and hate iniquity shall live. Jehovah has laid upon the consecrated the obligation to so inform the people now. Are you doing your part? Each one must prove his own faithfulness</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>“Watchtower” Campaign Gets Off to Good Start</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>8,305 Publishers Reporting in 122 Companies</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">So that the publishers throughout the world might know how the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign is moving, a special report was requested of a few companies for the first 15 days. Report from 122 shows that these had 8,305 company publishers In the field in the first 15 days of the campaign. The report shows excellent progress, and also reminds us of some improvements that can be made from now until the end of the campaign. Based on the report below, company publishers are placing on the average 2.7 books a month and 38 booklets a month. Our quota per month is 5 bound books and 62 booklets. Companies should watch their “thermometers”. Note when they are low, and keep them moving up, particularly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font2">booklets. Remember the slogan, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> in every home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions are coming in excellently. The average per publisher is .8 for the month, or almost one subscription per publisher. Let's keep up this good work. The hours for these publishers are far ahead of anything ever reported before for company publishers, averaging 20 hours a month for these 8,305 publishers. From the report below it indicates that January of this year will be equal to April of last year. The final report will be very interesting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Help the Office with Your New Subscriptions </span><span class="font2">Do the following to help subscribers to get their magazine early:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. Type out all subscription slips when possible; otherwise, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">pbint </span><span class="font2">with pen or pencil. Do not use red ink or a red pencil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. Write out in full the name of the street and the city. Abbreviate only in the case of states.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. Mark each subscription as either NEW or RENEWAL, at the place provided on the subscription slip.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. All secretaries of companies, and others handling the subscriptions, should accept the responsibility of seeing that the above suggestions are carried out. All subscription slips should be thoroughly checked to see that the necessary information is given thereon before accepting the subscription from the publishers to forward to the Society.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">back. Some brethren have been very successful in calling back on parties with whom they left literature and without any appointment, simply saying, “I placed such a book or booklet with you a week or ten days ago (or whatever the time may be). I just called back to see how you were enjoying it and how you are getting along.” The majority of people appreciate such friendly interest and usually invite the publisher in, and it affords an excellent opportunity to put on some recordings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Be on the alert for all openings; there are innumerable opportunities for making back calls and putting on the model studies.</span></p>

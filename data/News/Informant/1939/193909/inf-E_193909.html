<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">39,771 Publishers New Peak</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Publishers of Jehovah’s kingdom were so stirred by the world-wide convention that nothing could hold them back. The month following the convention finds a new peak of publishers, 39,771, engaging in the field work. This is very gratifying and brings joy to the hearts of all who are for the Kingdom, because they see the progressive onward march of the Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some companies have doubled their number of publishers during the year. This was accomplished by consistently aiding and instructing the inactive ones to do field work. The companies that have the Kingdom uppermost in their minds and have set aside strife and are working together in peace have shown the greatest increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society must still compile the report for “Divine Mandate” Testimony Period, and it is confidently expected that this month will find that we have reached the 40,000 publishers mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In just a short time now the new fiscal year of the Society begins, and it is natural to expect that next year will be the greatest of all, because of our greater understanding of the work to be done and the coming in of the “great multitude”. Every regional, zone, and company servant should in every manner assist the publishers to get into the field and should aid them in making 60 hours a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The average number of publishers in the field for the last 10 months has been 34,630. This is nearly 9,000 more publishers in the field per month than last year. Let’s look forward to next year with over a 40,000 average. “Theocracy” Testimony Period, in October, will find a new peak in publishers serving the Kingdom.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>New Booklet Off the Press</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">You have been wondering when the two lectures given by Brother Rutherford at the New York City convention, “Victory” and “Government and Peace”, already available on records, would be ready in print. The new booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font2"> containing both lectures, is now ready. The front cover shows a photograph of Brother Rutherford “in action” during the Sunday broadcast, taken just before the Catholic hoodlums staged their abortive attempt to break up the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every “locust” will want to have a share in taking this message into the homes of the people, and “take away the veneer of religion that has been smeared over the people to keep them in darkness”. Listen to the records, read the booklet, get set for a rally for The Theocracy during international testimony period in October.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Theocracy” Testimony Period Begins Oct. 1</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>More than 40,000 Publishers Expected</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Ever since Sunday, June 25, that memorable day when Brother Rutherford delivered the history-making speech “Government and Peace” at Madison Square Garden, the Lord’s people throughout the world have been waiting for its release for distribution among the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Saturday, October 1, will see your desire fulfilled. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font2"> will then be offered with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> on a contribution of 25c. Where the 25c combination cannot be placed, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace </span><span class="font2">with two other booklets should be offered on a 10c contribution; and where they are unable to contribute this amount but are interested and wish to read, the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font2"> should be left on any contribution they are able to offer; and if they are unable to contribute anything, leave the booklet with them free. This important booklet should be in every home in the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is the most vitally important combination we have ever been privileged to offer to the people; principally, because it is the Lord’s message of the hour. We have all</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The September Campaign</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">September is the close of the fiscal year 1939. Whether this year will result in more literature being placed than in 1938 depends much on the whole-hearted enthusiasm and the time devoted to the house-to-house field service by alt, the brethren during September. Let’s go ahead and do it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Place “Salvation” and Booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The offer during September has been increased to include </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font2">and three booklets on a contribution of 35c. This should result not only in a large number of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font2">books placed, but also in many more booklets distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Companies still have on their shelves old large-size colored-cover booklets (English and foreign) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font2"> or other self-covered booklets. All these should be cleared out of stock, turned over to the publishers, and put out in the field during September. This can easily be done if each and every publisher takes a proportionate share of these booklets and makes it his business to put them out during the month. The stockkeeper and company servant should see that whatever of such booklets are in stock are so disposed of at once. Zone servants should check to see that their respective zones have cleared their shelves of large-size booklets, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font2"> etc., so that by October 1 read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> and realize its power. We have heard or read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font2"> or will read it shortly if we haven’t read it already, and are acquainted with the desperate effort made by the Devil through the Hierarchy-Fascist-Couglinite combination to stop it at any cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have the recordings “Government and Peace”, and undoubtedly most of the brethren have played them a number of times and have been thrilled by the greatest speech ever delivered on earth since the day of our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This three-fold combination will rip a hole in the Devil’s earthly scheme of things that they will never be able to repair. Never before have we been so thoroughly equipped, nor have we had such a great responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let each one therefore, with humility of mind and a consuming zeal for the Lord, accept this great responsibility that the Lord has intrusted to us and go forward in the “Theocracy” Testimony Period to deliver the greatest witness ever given by the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society suggested 60 hours a month for each company pubthey can wholly concentrate on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font2"> booklet campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the week-ends of September an extensive witness should be given in the rurals and the small towns of your assignment. All cars available should start early for the “rurals”. On account of the fewer calls that can be made, and the expense involved, the brethren should be on their territory early and put in an average of from five to seven hours each Saturday and Sunday. During the other days of the week, when the publishers have only a few hours available, territory close by one's home should be worked, so that the time is put to the best use possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As soon as the company receives its supply of the new records, they should be put to immediate use. In the rurals especially, you should find it easy to run both sides of record P-204, P-203, “Snare and Racket” and “Victory”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Remember that during September, in addition to stressing the new book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font2"> the goal of each company is to distribute all the old large-size booklets and self-covered booklets in stock, as well as any </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font2"> booklets on hand. You should make it a point to leave at least one booklet in each rural home where there is any interest at all manifested. lisher. Many, realizing the great import of the hour in which we are living, will put in many more hours than that. Others who have not been able to attain the 60-hour quota up to now will find in this campaign the necessary incentive to overcome all obstacles and attain to that peak, and those who are so situated that it is impossible for them to put in 60 hours will be keenly disappointed in that but will gladly put in all the time they possibly can, that this important message may be delivered and this declaration of the Lord’s judgment against the enemy may be made manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The vicious and devilish attack at Madison Square Garden has proved a boomerang to the enemy. It makes a most effective background for Brother Rutherford’s speech, of which, by the Lord’s grace, he took due advantage. Therefore, as a part of this campaign this speech should be played in the hall of every company organization, it should be presented in every possible home where a back-call can be made, and the people in general, particularly the Catholic population, be given a vision of the devilish conditions that exist in that organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Plan your time and work so as to give the most effective witness possible. Use the “Snare and Racket” record to introduce </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font2"> and also use the opposite side of this record, “Victory No. 13,” following “Snare and Racket”. These records are an effective testimony for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font2"> Carry both books with you at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For those who do not yet have phonographs we have a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font2">testimony card, which will go out with this (September) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font2">This will also serve as an identification card for all publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Each publisher should have an assignment of territory around his or her home to work in at odd times throughout the week. Week-ends should be spent in cleaning up the towns and rurals before they become inaccessible because of winter weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">See that this combination is placed In all your small towns, large towns and rural territory before the winter closes in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> has broken all records. We have printed over a million copies already, and now find it necessary to work nights also to meet the demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to the above we have the “Victory” speech In recorded and printed form also. With all of these provisions of the Lord we have every reason to anticipate that the Kingdom Interests will advance tremendously during the “Theocracy” Testimony Period, and surely will find more publishers in the field than ever before, more than 40,000 singing the praises of the Lord in the United States alone.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“Snare and Racket”</span><br><br><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Aid in Placing </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Salvation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Thousands of orders have been received in the last few weeks for the new records “Government and Peace”, “Victory,” and “Snare and Racket”. As local company servant, have you ordered your require’ ments? Has every user of the phonograph ordered the record “Snare and Racket”? Remember the special offer of all fourteen discs which can be had at $7 if the order is placed before October 1. Additional discs of “Snare and Racket” may be had for 50c each if ordered at the same time. Use the special order blank furnished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As soon as you receive these records put them to good use in public meetings and back-calls, and the “Snare and Racket” disc in door-to-door witnessing. In your door-to-door witnessing with “Snare and Racket” also run the other side, which contains the introduction of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> to the convention assembly on June 24. A tremendous witness will be given in the next few months, throughout the world, with this new series. By the time “Theocracy” Testimony Period arrives every publisher, world-wide, will have these records for the new year’s campaign.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Information Marchers in Groups of Three</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Read Instructions Carefully</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The purpose of an Information march is to convey to the people information relative to the Kingdom. By having two or three publishers in given territories, with the proper overhead standards and placards, a more effective witness can be given than by a long march of several hundred persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Arrangement of March</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Three publishers should be given an assignment of territory in which to march. These three should walk fifteen to twenty feet apart, two of them carrying overhead standards and the third one distributing handbills, and all three wearing the large placards on their bodies. These three marchers should be assigned to one or more blocks and will continue to march in this assigned territory during the time allotted for the march. If advisable in your territory, they can be given just one block in which to march, or even one side of a block. This is left to the discretion of the one arranging the march.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Other groups of three publishers should be given a similar assignment, until all publishers are given territory in which to march and the main section of your city covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Parades” of ten or twenty or more publishers in a line walking down the main street are to be discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In following out this new arrangement of information marches the publisher comes within the law set down by the Supreme Court in the cases of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell</span><span class="font2"> vs. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Griffin </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">C.I.O.</span><span class="font2"> vs. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hague.</span><span class="font2"> At no time should permits be asked for to carry on these information marches, regardless of any local ordinances, because an individual has the right to carry signs on his person and distribute announcements in this manner. This arrangement has been tried in several cities and has proved to be a more effective means of giving the witness and informing the people of the coming lectures.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>8,885 More Publishers This Year than Last</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">A comparison of the ten months’ report covering the first ten months of 1939 with that of the same months of 1938 is most gratifying. An increase of 8,885 publishers each month is a clear indication of the awakening of the people of good will and Jonadabs to their great privilege of serving the Lord and advancing the Kingdom Interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This represented an increase of 2,197,070 hours. The bound books, of course, show a decrease, but we believe that with an aggressive campaign with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> book during the month of September, which campaign began in August, this can be overcome by the beginning of the fiscal year. Each and every publisher should accept it as his personal responsibility to see that this deficit in the number of bound books placed is wiped out by October 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some might say, How can the</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>New Placard Packet</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The Society furnishes for use in information marches a packet of twenty large-size placards and four small cards, size 11 by 14 inches. On the small signs appear the wordings:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(1)</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Religion is a snare and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A RACKET</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(2)</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Christianity is youb protection</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(3)</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Serve God and Chbist the Kino</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(4)</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Read the book Salvation </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AND LEARN THE BIGHT WAY</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In arranging your information marches, print on cards 11 by 14 inches the name of your hall, the address and time of meeting, and, if space permits, the subject of the next talk. One of these will back up each of the overhead standards, and by the carrier’s continually turning these standards the people on the sidewalk can read both sides, in addition to obtaining a handbill announcing the meetings. The large signs are to be worn by all the publishers who advertise the four latest speeches by Brother Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In placing your marches, one territory can have overhead standards Nos. 1 and 2, backed up with the local address, and the territory adjoining it on both sides could have overhead standards with the back and front giving the address of the public meeting. Then, the territory next can have overhead standards Nos. 3 and 4. Thus you distribute throughout the business section the various signs and keep prominently before the eyes of the people the time and place of the next meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Society is now filling orders for the new packet of placards, and the publishers should put them to use immediately. Arrange for information marches in your own home town and in other towns in your territory where public meetings are arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Advertise the King and the Kingdom! </span><span class="font2">report be so gratifying if we have a decrease of over 422,258 bound books? If there were nothing else to balance this, of course it would not be very encouraging; but it is when we see that there was over a 400-percent increase in back-calls made during this period, also an increase of approximately 38,000 new subscriptions and almost 370,-000 booklets, whereby the decrease of 422,258 bound books is more than offset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, the Lord’s people are going to zealously endeavor to clean up this deficit of bound books, so that they will have an increase in every branch of the service by the end of the fiscal year. This can be done, and undoubtedly will be done.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Pioneers, on the other hand, are to send in their orders for this new booklet. The new booklet will not be consigned to pioneers. Order at once whatever quantity you wish of these booklets, as well as other literature, so that we can ship your order to you by October 1.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>New Folders for Distribution</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>One for Public Meetings, Another for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Salvation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The Society is publishing two new folders, which the advertising servant should be sure to have on hand for use by the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The one folder is the advertisement for the series of lectures “Government and Peace”, “Fascism or Freedom,” “Victory” and others, and allows room on the front side for stamping thereon the local address of the meetings. These folders should be prepared by the advertising servant well in advance of the meetings, so that the publishers, in covering the territory, will leave them in every home around the meeting place. They should also be used in information marches advertising the meeting. Keep a good supply of these on hand, as they will be used extensively during the next six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Salvation” Folder</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is of such great importance that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sal cation</span><span class="font2"> be placed in the hands of all who will read that it is wise for publishers to carry with them the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> folder when not distributing the Public Meeting folder. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> folder should be left with all people who do not take the book and in every home where no one answers at the door. The people reading this folder later may desire to get this book through the Society or through the local company. There is a space left on the folder in which can be inserted the local address of the company meetings, as well as the local telephone number, so that interested persons in your territory can phone or attend the meetings, to make further inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bookmarks</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Where the person obtains a book in the regular witness work this book should contain one of the bookmarks, printed by the Society, on which appears your local address and the time and place of meetings. It is reported that many interested persons have attended meetings because of this convenient bookmark giving them the information. Are you using them in your territory ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All orders for bookmarks should be made on the Bookmark order form. Be sure to give the complete information regarding the time and place of your local meetings. These bookmarks are of no value unless they correctly direct the people of good will to the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Both of the above-mentioned handbills can be had at 40c a thousand. The bookmarks are $2 per thousand; $1.25 for 500; $.75 for 250. Not less than 250 bookmarks can be ordered. Use the special order blank for bookmarks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The more information we leave with the public, the sooner they will become acquainted with Jehovah’s witnesses and decide where they are going to be: either with the Lord’s people or against them. “He that hath an ear, let him hear.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>September Reports</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Companies and pioneers are to close their September report on Sunday, September 24. The work done from September 25-30 is to be included in your October report. Each company and pioneer is therefore requested to send in the September report to the Society as quickly as possible after Sunday, September 24, so that we can have these in time to include in the 1939 fiscal year’s report of the Society,</span></p>

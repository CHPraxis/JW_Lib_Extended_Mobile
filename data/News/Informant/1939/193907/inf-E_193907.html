<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Salvation” Simultaneously Released at All Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah Blesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">World-wide Broadcast</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By far the most blessed and enthusiastic convention of the Lord’s people to date has come and gone in the General Convention emanating from New York, June 23-25. The high points were so numerous that it is impossible for us to cover all of them in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Rutherford’s public address of Sunday afternoon was the high point. This speech was delivered under most tense and dramatic circumstances and will not be forgotten by those who were privileged to witness the event and hear the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Madison Square Garden Packed</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Visualize, if you can, an immense auditorium such as Madison Square Garden with close to 20,000 people packed into it, and a powerful witness for Jehovah and against the Devil being delivered. Then some three hundred fanatical Catholics in one section of the upper balcony tried to break up the meeting. Another small group in another section tried to do likewise. However, the Lord directed the handling of this situation so that not only were their efforts unsuccessful, but the Lord, maneuvering the enemy’s forces as well as his own, caused the entire setup to work to the glory of His name and for the blessing of his people and the confusion of the enemy. The enthusiastic applause with which the mighty audience received each point of Brother Rutherford's speech struck terror to the hearts of the hoodlum disturbers. The results of the upheaval were—</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. To cause Brother Rutherford to determine by God’s grace to drive the message he had to deliver into the microphone at any cost. This he did with a force and authority never equaled in the past.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. The attack established a background for everything Brother Rutherford said, and by their own words and actions they stand condemned of doing the very things that the Lord reveals they have been doing and which Brother Rutherford was telling the audience about at that particular time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. Many honest Catholics in the Madison Square Garden, and those attending the other assemblies, and those listening to the radio, have indicated that they are heartily disgusted with and ashamed of the disgraceful tactics of Catholic Action. Evidently this is also percolating through to the Hierarchy; for they are breaking their necks now to discountenance what happened, claiming that it was radical Coughlinites that were responsible and that these are only a minor faction of Catholicism and do not properly represent their organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">However, they waited too long. The facts got out and exposed their true position before they could be stopped, and honest people are getting their eyes opened. Not only that, but the whole disgraceful action on their part has, under the Lord’s direction, been recorded and will encircle the earth again when this is reproduced in the homes of the people by the phonographs of tens of thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses. This honor have all his saints and also their companions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Victory”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another high point was Brother Rutherford’s speech on Saturday afternoon, entitled “Victory”, clearly proving that we have come to the time when the Lord’s people are to take aggressive action; that the people of God are to go forward like locusts; not killing the people physically, but destroying the provender which the religionists have dished up for the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Salvation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another high point was the release of the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font3"> which is a very important step in the progression of the Lord’s arrangement, particularly in providing for the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All through the convention the brethren had before them on the program “Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah”; so when Brother Rutherford introduced and released the book, the significance of the quotation came to all. Surely “Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah”, the knowledge of which he has committed to his people that they may publish It abroad to the glory of his name and to the blessing of the people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Saltation</span><span class="font3"> was simultaneously released in all convention cities at the same time, In Australia, the British Isles, Canada, Hawaii and the United States, each point receiving its respective consignment on time. The brethren eagerly devoured its pages between sessions —reluctant to waste one precious second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">World-wide Broadcast</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another remarkable indication of the Lord’s supervision of the entire convention was the unanimous reports from all parts of the earth that the reception was excellent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Both lectures circled this planet. Reports have come from every part of the world indicating unusual reception. One engineer handling the overseas service said, “You people are always lucky.” We know that Jehovah supervises these arrangements to His praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The key city for this convention was New York. There the convention opened in Manhattan Center. This spacious auditorium was well filled by Friday evening. By Saturday it was crowded out, and some 2,500 to 3,000 could not get in to hear Brother Rutherford at all on Saturday afternoon. Saturday night the convention moved into Madison Square Garden without confusion or commotion. Sunday morning the brethren assembled there for the final day’s services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Information marches were another outstanding feature of the convention. Between 3,000 and 4,000 brethren participated in these marches, giving New York City the greatest witness it has ever had, and one which it will not soon forget. There was much enthusiasm and joy manifested by the brethren who participated in this most effective means of advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The enthusiastic and thrilling Declaration meetings indicated the Lord’s blessings were many upon his people. Space will not permit us to go more into detail here. Read it all in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Remember, “Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah.” He has entrusted us with the job of taking the facts concerning it in print to the people. Let everybody be ready for the “Divine Mandate” Testimony Period, commencing August 1.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The Messenger</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">All of Jehovah’s people will desire </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font3"> giving a complete report of the world-wide convention, not only that they may be informed of the happenings at each of the convention cities, but also that they may place it In the hands of those of good will at back-calls and model studies and mall it to their friends and relatives. Orders for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font3"> should be placed by the company servant for all publishers asso-</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Forty Thousand Publishers During “Divine Mandate”!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Reach the Goal in August</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In April, 1939, by Jehovah’s grace, we reached a new high peak of publishers of 38,835, which was an increase of almost 5,000 over the previous month, and 8,000 over April 1938. It is Jehovah’s time to bring in the increase, and he is bringing it, by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the world-wide convention, many participated in advertising the Kingdom for the first time, either in actual door-to-door service or in information marches; and these were appreciative of the opportunity of thus serving their God. The instruction provided by Jehovah in the various discourses, and especially in that by Brother Rutherford on “Victory”, was thrilling beyond description, as Jehovah’s people saw that the only way to have protection and blessing from the Lord was to engage in “His strange work”, as all who spurned this privilege now would be engulfed in “His strange act”. The “recruits”, along with the “seasoned warriors” in the Lord’s army, were thrilled at the prospects of being on the Victor’s side, knowing beyond question that, although the Devil’s forces would bring every Instrument into play elated with the company. The cost is five cents per copy. Remit with order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Autographed Edition Released</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was a thrill to all who attended one of the convention cities, or who attended “by radio”, when Brother Rutherford, at the conclusion of his address on “Victory”, held aloft the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> and announced that this new book was being released. Not only were these books released at the New York City convention, but every convention city was supplied with sufficient copies of the Autographed Edition, so that all who desired a copy could obtain one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “food convenient” contained therein is right “up to the minute”, provided now by the Lord for his people, and especially for the “great multitude”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who were unable to attend, or who failed to obtain a copy at the convention, should order now. The Autographed Edition is fifty cents per copy. Obtain one for your own use, so you can begin your study immediately. Many with whom you are holding model studies and back-calls will desire one. Have these in mind when placing your orders. Those associated with a company organization should place their orders through the company. All orders for literature or other supplies by a company should always be </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SIGNED BY THE COMPANY SERVANT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As outlined elsewhere in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> August 1 marks the time for general distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font3">to begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">against the Lord’s people, “they shall not prevail.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The information contained In the various addresses, and particularly’ in “Victory” and “Government and Peace”, was for a purpose. This wasn’t just “another convention”. It wasn’t a time to meet “old friends”, nor a time for “fellowship” as we once applied the term. It was a period of instruction and preparation for the battle ahead. Representatives from the enemy’s eamp were there—both of the Hierarchy and of those once posing as our brethren. They heard what was said about the manner in which Jehovah’s witnesses will hereafter ‘push the battle to the gate (of the enemy)’ with intense activity and without compromise. Now let’s prove </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TO THEM THAT WE MEAN BUSINESS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is every reason why &quot;all [spiritual] Israel” and alt, “strangers [Jonadabs]” should zealously and determinedly take hold on and advance the Kingdom interests by taking the message of Jehovah’s government of peace to others of good will, thus affording them the opportunity of accepting the King-</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page</span><span class="font3"> 2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">column</span><span class="font3"> 4)</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>40,000 Publishers in the United States</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Greatly thrilled and encouraged by having some participation in the grandest convention ever, Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions eagerly look forward to the “Divine Mandate” Testimony Period beginning August 1 and continuing throughout the month of August. Appropriately, during this timely testimony period </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> is to be offered to the peoples of all English-speaking countries of the world. Like a swarm of locusts, those who love Jehovah and righteousness will unitedly descend upon “Christendom” with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font3"> Filled with zeal by the forcible messages which were heralded by Brother Rutherford in “Victory” and “Government and Peace”, the witnesses everywhere are determined to show their appreciation to the Lord, more than ever devoting their time and energy toward publishing Jehovah’s name and his kingdom. Satan and all his visible representatives are now viciously and desperately fighting against the witnesses of Jehovah; but they cannot prevail, for the King now rules in the midst of His enemies and victory is certain to all who are on Jehovah’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Waste No Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Everything should be in readiness to commence the campaign Tuesday, August 1. Publishers should be well stocked with the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font3"> The brethren at the factory have been working day and night to get out sufficient of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font3"> and as this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> goes to press over 400,000 copies have already been printed. Consignments of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Saltation</span><span class="font3"> are now under way to all companies, and these should be on hand in plenty of time before the campaign. All publishers should know beforehand just what territory they are going to work during the campaign. As all territory becomes “new&quot; for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font3"> the territory servant can eas</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Study the “Order of Trial”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">It is apparent from correspondence that conies to Brooklyn that many publishers have not studied their </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Order of Trial.</span><span class="font3"> It is especially noticeable with reference to Section Three. That section tells what to do in the case of assault and riot, but the publishers write in daily reporting such assaults and riots and wind up with “What shall we do next?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This form of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">religious action</span><span class="font3"> is increasing in various parts of the country, and it therefore appears necessary to restate the course of action for publishers to follow. Hence, BEAD, STUDY and PRESERVE the following :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. Study your </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Order of Trial.</span><span class="font3"> This applies to the publisher individually and to the company as a group. Study it by yourself and in your company gatherings. In your study pay particular attention to Section Three and determine in advance what course of action to take when assaulted or mobbed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. As part of your study, ascertain in advance how to secure a warrant for the arrest of a person who has unlawfully interfered with your Kingdom activity. Delegate a member of the company to investi-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Have You Considered Pioneer Service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ily arrange adequate and convenient territory for the publishers. Get to your territory as early as you can, and work there as long as possible, being sure to take along with you a good supply of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bookmarks and Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By August 1 all companies who ordered should have received their bookmarks. The publishers should be sure to see that a bookmark is given to each one who takes the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font3"> The company should immediately arrange for a midweek study of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> at their Kingdom hall; and the publishers should tell the people about this study, so that as many as possible can attend. The people should be encouraged not only to read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font3"> but as well study it with others at the Kingdom hall meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is also a propitious time to get all the people of good will already on your list to come regularly to a meeting of the company. The back-call servant should see that all the names he has on his back-call list are called upon soon with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font3"> It would be well for the publishers, when calling on these interested ones, to take along the autographed edition also; for many will want to contribute 50c and thus enjoy a share in bearing a part of the initial cost in the printing of this new book. Such back-calls, of course, should be made in the evenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The convention has stirred up many of the newly interested ones to the point where they realize the necessity and privilege of taking an active stand for the Kingdom. The publishers should take these out with them in the field and show them how they can most effectively’ sing the praises of Jehovah. There is no testimony card provided for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font3"> However, all will find it to their advantage to use the remarks made by Brother Rutherford in his gate this subject and report clearly to the company the exact steps required and the place to go to secure a warrant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">3. Self-defense is justifiable under the laws of man and the laws of God. Don’t let any Papal subject or other religionist maul you in the dirt or beat you up without such resistance as you are able to give.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. Prepare for trial. If you are assaulted and unlawfully beaten or struck by one or more persons, get the name and address of each of such persons; also get the name and address of each one who witnessed the affair. Talk with these witnesses and have each one write out a statement (or you write it out for him) as to what happened, and let each witness sign his or her name to it. Keep these statements for your own use. If necessary to furnish the facts in such statements to the prosecutor or other official, furnish him with a copy, but you keep the originals. Send a copy of each statement to Brooklyn, marked “Legal Desk”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. Get a warrant for the arrest of each of the lawbreakers. The place to get the warrant is determined by your local conditions. It may be from a justice of the peace, from the police court, or from a letter in the Autographed Edition. This letter makes an excellent testimony. Study it carefully. If each zone servant, each servant of the company, each publisher, performs his assigned duty, there is every reason to expect at least 40,000 publishers active in the field during the &quot;Divine Mandate” Testimony Period. Be sure that you do your part.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Goal of Each Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “Divine Mandate” Testimony Period should result in the largest number of publishers of each company being active in the field; more than in any other previous month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each publisher should strive to reach the 60-hour goal during this month.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">Also, each publisher should endeavor to place eight of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font3">during this month, and in view of the tremendous interest aroused by the reading of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts, Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> magazines, and by information marches, and the publicity given by the newspapers of the unsuccessful attempt of the Catholic Hierarchy to break up tlie Madison Square Garden meeting, this goal is well within the reach of every active Kingdom publisher. With more publishers in the field, and putting in more time, we confidently expect the “Divine Mandate” Testimony Period to produce the greatest witness with a bound ’ book that has thus far been given in any one month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This work must be done speedily if the people of good will are to be properly warned so as to take their stand wholly on the side of the King and his kingdom. Graciously Jehovah provides us with suitable equipment to successfully carry out our</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">commission, and now with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font3">added to our ever-increasing weap-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">ons of warfare, there is every reason to joyfully go forth in the face of all the opposition and obstacles the Devil may bring about. Confidently, courageously and boldly, then, let , each one faithfully engage in this Jehovah’s “strange work”, keeping, ever in mind the promise, ‘They shall not prevail against you,’ Don't forget </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">WATCHTOWER </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">and</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">municipal court, or it may be necessary for you to see the district attorney, or the city or county prosecutor. As suggested above, find out in advance the exact procedure. Inform each publisher.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">6. Sue them for damages. If you are seriously injured or property is destroyed as a result of such assault, follow up the criminal proceeding with a civil action for damages.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">7. Publicity. Evil-doers hate publicity. They prefer to work in the dark. It is our privilege and duty to drag their evil deeds out into the open where all may see and consider. Therefore, when an aggravated assault or mob action takes place, give the matter as much prompt publicity as possible. Ix-t the world know ail about it. especially if the Hierarchy or its allied organizations are mixed up in the affair. Write out the facts clearly in narrative form, making several copies, and then turn such over to the editor of each local newspaper. Value of such publicity hinges largely upon accuracy of the points embodied in the published story: hence the need for preparing promptly and carefully that which is released to the press.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">8. Send full reports. Report these events as quickly as they occur. In reporting, give complete name and address of each participant, as falas possible. When you have interviewed officials, such as a chief of police, sheriff, or judge, give the</span></p></li></ul>

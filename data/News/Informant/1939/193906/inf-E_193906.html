<p><span class="font3">As this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> goes to press arrangements have been made to tie tn 21 cities to the network convention: 10 in the United States, 10 in the British Isles, and Honolulu, Hawaii. In the South, at Mobile, Ala., a special assembly is being arranged for the Colored brethren. In New York City, the key con- _ vention city, as well as in every = other convention city, the publishers' <sup>= </sup>are zealously preparing every detail for the comfort and convenience of the conventioners and for a mighty, united witness to be given to the honor of Jehovah's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our big job is to advertise “Government and Peace”. This lecture, which Brother Rutherford will deliver at Madison Square Garden, June 25, at </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font3"> p.m., will be heard simultaneously in all the convention cities and over a coast-to-coast radio chain. Our aim is to pack out not only the Madison Square Garden, but also the auditorium engaged in each convention city. To do this will require strenuous effort by all those coming to the convention. Therefore, come prepared to witness for the Kingdom, to join in Information marches and to advertise the public meeting by every means offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On Saturday, at 3 p.m., Brother Rutherford will deliver another address to the publishers in all the convention cities, and we are eagerly looking forward to both of these sessions as well as all the other blessings in store for those who attend.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>It Can Be Done</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>31/2 Million Pieces of Literature Placed in June</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign is over. The results of the Lord’s blessing upon the campaign from beginning to end has thrilled the hearts of the Lord’s consecrated people everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Well over 100,000 new subscribers for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Millions who have read the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font3"> booklets are excellent prospects for the special seven-booklet offer in June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">June promises to be a month of great blessings from the Lord and, as we should expeet, the month of greatest activity to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The job before us is to advertise and attend the greatest convention of all times and place three and a half million pieces of literature in the hands of the people. Let us not throw up our hands and conclude it can’t be done. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">IT CAN BE DONE. </span><span class="font3">Last June we placed three and a half million pieces of literature. This year we have more than eight thousand additional publishers. The Lord expects his people to increase their time In the field by placing before each company publisher a 60-hour quota; therefore we are to have more hours. We have over 100,000 more good prospects besides the millions who have read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts. IT CAN BE DONE.</span><span class="font3"> BUT we must plan and work; we can’t drift along and expect to attain it. Here is what each company publisher will have to do: place 3 combinations of seven booklets a week (or 12 a month) and 4 individual booklets a week (or 16 a month)—making a total of 100 booklets a month. It can be done ; we did it last June, and can repeat it this June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Time is important. If we put in the time and present the combination properly the rest will take care of itself. Our time quota is two hours a day. What we lose of this for any reason should be made up Saturday and Sunday, so that at the end of the week we have our 14 hours, or 60 at the end of the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren who have consistently participated in evening liouse-to-house witnessing are enthusiastic about it; more people are at home, and they receive a better reception</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Many Can Tune in Shortwave</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The lecture “Government and Peace”, which originates at Madison Square Garden, will be carried world-wide by a radio chain and shortwave telephone service. Radio folders will be consigned to the cities where radio stations are engaged to carry this lecture, and near-by places served by these same stations. When you receive your consignment of folders, be sure to distribute them all before Saturday night, June 24. Many of the brethren in foreign lands, we feel sure, will be able to pick up the shortwave beams between 16 and 50 meters. They should tune in their shortwave sets on Saturday between the hours of 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., Eastern Daylight Saving Time, and on Sunday between the hours of 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., Eastern Daylight Saving Time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those hearing the lecture over their local radio station or by shortwave and desiring to send a message relative to reception or appreciation can do so by addressing “Watchtower Rutherford Brooklyn, New York”. Radio stations to which you listen will undoubtedly appreciate a letter from you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">32-Page Report of Convention Order Now — 5c a Copy </span><span class="font3">The June 23-25 convention, being world-wide in scope, will be of interest to every Kingdom publisher. Those unable to attend this convention, as well as those who do, will probably desire a permanent record of it. The last </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Messenger</span><span class="font3"> contained 64 pages. This one will have 32 pages, and only half the amount will be asked to cover the cost, namely, 5c a copy. Your orders can be sent in any time. We suggest that you place your order with the company serv-</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">ant for the quantity you need. Remittance should accompany all orders, as no charges will be made on account. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font3"> will be a good publication to leave with the people of good will. Order accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At each of the convention cities photographs will be taken of interesting scenes, as well as news items. Any publisher having an outstanding item of interest or a good photograph taken at the convention may turn it over to the chairman. Each convention chairman will forward a report, with pictures, to the Society, which will compile all material to be published in this 32-page magazine, of the same size as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Occasionally wo receive a letter from a postmaster somewhere in the country to pay postage on handbills that have been left in mall boxes. Of course, it is not the Society that puts these folders in mail boxes, but it may' have been done by publishers who are not acquainted with the postal law on this matter. The Post Office Department has a law to the effect that ‘whoever shall knowingly or willingly deposit any mailable matter such as statements of account, circulars, or other like matter, on which no postage has been paid, in any letter box established for the delivery of mail on any mail route, shall for every such offense be punishable by a fine of not more than $300.00’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We hope that the pioneers and company publishers will please take note of this and not leave handbills, booklets or any other printed matter in mail boxes. Place them in the hands of the people and, in the case of circulars, if no one Is at home, put them between tlie door and the doorjamb or under the door or partly under the door mat. Do not use the mail boxes in cities or on rural routes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Mighty Witness Was Given</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are submitting in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> a summary of the activity in the United States alone for the fourmonth campaign, for your careful consideration. There are some points that show up very favorably; others that do not show up as well as we had anticipated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Books &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;435,759</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,228,013</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Total literature &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,663,772</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Peak of publishers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38,835</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,931,031</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">New subscriptions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93,111</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Attendance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,303,848</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Back-calls &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;519,373</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The response for additional publishers was excellent, reaching a peak of 38,835 in April, well over the fifteen percent that we set as our quota. In fact, this proves that our new quota of 40,000 publishers will be attained ere long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoicer</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions showed up excellently, too. The total of subscriptions in the office for the United States and foreign countries is now over 120.000. Splendid I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was in the bound books and booklets that we fell below our quota, though the results reached were unquestionably good. Yet, with the United States enjoying by far the most favorable conditions for freely spreading the Kingdom message, it was hoped that we could place 75 percent of the world-wide quota. Instead, we were able to place but 43| percent of the booklet quota and 43J percent of the bound book quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The splendid work that was done during April Indicates we might have reached our quota of books and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">General Information</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers should always remit for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> new and renewal subscriptions, whether the subscriptions are for six months or for a longer period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1939 Calendar is out of stock; do not order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font3"> booklets are now available in Finnish, French, German, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font3"> booklets are now available in Polish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> there is being mailed the new Cost List. As soon as received make the following corrections: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font3"> booklets, English and foreign, should be shown as FIVE CENTS per copy, instead of 3lc as indicated in Cost List. Under </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Japanese,</span><span class="font3"> page 17, bound books should be the same as for any other foreign language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Electric Flasher Signs</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The electric flasher signs may be used to advertise your local headquarters. Many times those invited to attend </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> or service meetings have difficulty in locating the hall or home. Have the sign in a conspicuous place, where all can see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Additionally, these may be used at zone assemblies to assist the out-of-town publishers to locate the meeting place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While they last—two for 50c. Order through company servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Placards Used in Information Marches </span><span class="font3">The Society has been furnishing a packet of 20 large placards and 6 small placards for 50c. The shipping of these is more expensive than anticipated, and therefore it is necessary, in order to cover the cost, to raise the charge on each packet. Henceforth a packet of Placards for Information Marches will be 65c. booklets if we had shown the same zeal and enthusiasm throughout the four months as we did in April. The ‘expectancy’ of being able to make up the three months’ deficit in April did not materialize. This should be a lesson which all of the brethren should learn: that the Lord is directing his organization from his temple and when he calls upon his people to enter into or participate in a campaign the work should be taken very seriously and each one from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">very beginning</span><span class="font3"> should push the campaign with all his strength and time instead of merely doing so near its close.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Taken as a whole, however, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign resulted in a mighty witness throughout the earth to the glory of the Lord, and one that all of the Lord’s people are truly grateful to him for having some part in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The month of May was an extension of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign, but not included in the above totals. June and July will be booklet months and will enable the brethren to put out all of their remaining copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font3"> Plan your work now, and have in mind that last June over 3J million pieces of literature were distributed. There is much work to be done that by the Lord’s grace can be accomplished, especially now that we are nearing 40,000 publishers in the field. Have in mind the 60-hour quota for publishers and strive to attain that. Try to put out 100 booklets during June. Always have in mind seeking first the Kingdom and its righteousness. We have been richly blessed in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Campaign and look forward now to the fight ahead and the work to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 8) </span><span class="font3">and place more literature. Let us all utilize this manner of service more and really go after our 60 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Work in your “folder” distribution and “information marches” on definite schedule arranged by company servants. Each company servant and his assistants should plan every feature of the work very carefully. Plan ; put in the time; work according to instructions—and the results are assured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Three and a half million pieces of literature in addition to attending and advertising the greatest convention of all time. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">IT CAN BE DONE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers should do their share in this campaign. Those who feel they should present a combination on a dollar contribution should include seven booklets in each one. In fact, seven booklets should be included in all combinations, or even fourteen booklets with two bound books. Let us all pull together for the greatest witness to date. Surely, it means more work, but we must work more to get those 60 hours in the field. We don’t read of any murmuring on the part of typical Israel when Joshua told them they had to go around Jericho seven times on the seventh day. That meant more work, greater privileges, and more joy. The true Israel of God will never murmur at that.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Many inquiries come from publishers throughout the country relative to what have been designated as “sandwich-sign parades”. They ask, Shall we secure a permit for such work? Shall we march without a permit? Is it necessary to secure a permit to carry placards and signs?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the first place, it would seem advisable to correct the phraseology of this line of Kingdom activity. The term “sandwich-sign parade” is a misnomer. It does not accurately identify the particular witnessing work thus carried on. Tn fact, this language cheapens and makes the work appear degrading. When the publishers go forth carrying a message upon a placard they are not engaged in a parade. A group of publishers walking in single file, fifteen to twenty feet apart from one another, carrying signs or placards, and thus moving upon the sidewalk in such manner as not to interfere with other traffic, does not constitute a “parade”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The signs they carry convey information to any and every one, just as the Israelites’ march around Jericho conveyed by action or sign a communication or message, to wit, (1) that the forces of Jehovah God were at hand ready to take action in the interest of the people of good</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Society is inaugurating another feature to aid in finding the people of good will and directing them to your company studies. This feature is a bookmark, attractively printed in two colors on material of good quality. One side of the bookmark reads thus: &quot;Dear Reader, Have you a QUESTION? Get it answered at your neighborhood study meeting. Or write WATCHTOWER and a visitor will explain. Our only purpose is to aid people of good will to come to better understand God’s purposes.” On the other side there is room in which to print the name of your local hall, its address, and the time of your various meetings. The Society will do the printing of these bookmarks on your order. When ordering, use Special Order Blank enclosed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">all publishers should co-operate in getting these out. The same should be true with respect to the foreign-language booklets. Throughout July the pioneers may continue, as during June, to draw on company stock, the company servant sending in Transfer of Stock (signed by himself and the pioneer) at the end of this booklet campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All eyes are focused on June 23-25; and the convention will, no doubt, be the occasion for many to participate for the first time in the service of our Master. The convention will likewise be a stimulus to all to be out in the field as Kingdom publishers during July, taking the message of God’s kingdom to others of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The marvelous new high peak of publishers, noted elsewhere in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> will spur all on to a special effort to encourage all who are associated with the local organizations. or being called on in isolated territory by pioneers, to engage in the field work, with our eye on our goal Of FORTY THOUSAND PUBLISHERS this fiscal year!</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“March” relates to a dignified forward movement. Why not always use the term “march” instead of the undesirable term “parade”, which undesirable term is embodied in prohibitive ordinances? This marching is done with a message on record, that is, in printed or permanent form—for the eye, as distinguished from the spoken message, for the eab. The message thus “on record” conveys information to passers-by that is of value to them. Therefore it seems that the term “information sign” is much more in harmony with the dignified nature of this activity than the term “sandwich sign”. Dispense with the term “sandwich-sign parade” and in place thereof use the term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“information march&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Shall we secure permits or licenses to engage in such a march? The United States Supreme Court decision of Lovell </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">v.</span><span class="font3"> City of Griffin upholds the right to disseminate information and opinion, unhampered by license restrictions. Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers are disseminating information concerning meetings and other matters when they go forth in such a march; and no municipality has the right or authority to hamper such march by means of a license restriction. Therefore it is unnecessary to apply for a permit. If arrests occur, the issues should be contested in court along lines stated in the “Order of Trial”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The publishers will readily appreciate the value of this new feature. The obtainer of a bound book with one of these bookmarks inserted will always have in a convenient place the name and address of your local hall and know where he can find the answers to various questions that arise in his mind as he reads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Orders for these bookmarks can be placed immediately. The Society will furnish them at the following rates:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In lots of 1,000 or more, $2.00 per thousand;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">500 bookmarks, $1.25;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">250 bookmarks, $.75.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No orders smaller than 250 will be accepted. Remittance must accompany orders. The above rates merely cover the cost of material, printing and shipping. To have similar bookmarks printed locally would cost the company $3.00 or $4.00 a thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Leave a bookmark with every bound book you place.</span></p>

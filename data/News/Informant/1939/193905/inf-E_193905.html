</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Too Good to Stop</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The results of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">Campaign to date are thrilling. It is manifest that the Lord’s rich blessing has been upon our efforts, and truly “this is the LORD’S doing : it is marvelous in our eyes”. As this has been particularly a campaign to obtain </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscriptions, all are pleased to see the large number obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Because of the vital importance to those of good will of the lifegiving truths contained in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> the special offer will be extended another month. In other words, throughout the entire month of May the publishers will continue to offer a bound book and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font1"> also </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font1"> free with each new one-year subscription obtained for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font1"> If your company has not reached its quota of subscriptions, bound books or booklets for the four-month campaign, keep on charting your progress on your “thermometers” until you do reach that quota. Those companies whose thermometers have been slow in “warming up” will be glad to have another month to “turn on the heat” and shoot their thermometers up to overflowing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While many companies have been able to maintain their quota on subscriptions, their book and booklet quotas have not been met, and an added month will be a boon to them, allowing additional time in which to bring these items up to and over their quota. By the end of May all the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> booklets should be distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the people do not subscribe for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font1"> drop to the</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Being Added to Combination</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A large percentage of the companies are behind in their booklet placements for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">Campaign. We have entered into the last month of the campaign, April, but because the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font1">magazine is going so well and is so greatly appreciated by the public the campaign is being extended for one month. This additional time not only will increase the circulation of the magazine and bound books, but will aid all company publishers and pioneers to place their full supply of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">April, as well as May, should find a tremendous increase in booklet distribution over any previous month. Last June, during the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font1">campaign, there were 31 million booklets placed in the one month. This can be duplicated if the same effort is put forth by the publishers. Since there are more publishers in 25c combination of a bound book and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font1"> If they fail to take that, then offer the two booklets alone on a contribution of five cents. Every method should be used to get these booklets into the hands of the people. Consider the various methods suggested elsewhere in this, as well as in the April </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Don’t Neglect Your Rurals</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is expected that by April 30 most companies will have been able to thoroughly cover their urban territory and be ready to take </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Enemies, Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font1"> into the rurals. Be sure to call on all your </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font1"> subscribers with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoioer</span><span class="font1"> offer. This will be an excellent opportunity to build up your back-call and model-study work in the rurals for the summer. Every </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> subscriber is a potential publisher. The current issues of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> definitely show the Jon-adabs their responsibility toward the Kingdom service; and so these should be called on and assisted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 1 has been thoroughly appreciated by the brethren throughout the world, and a real effort has been put forth to increase their Kingdom activities. Now that winter is definitely over, many whose activities have been hampered will materially increase their time in the field, and the month of May should, additionally, find more publishers engaging in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign. Take advantage of the good weather conditions and long daylight hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the field, since everyone is striving to put in more time, and since we now have two booklets to distribute, instead of one, we should easily surpass our previous high mark of 3J million booklets in one month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">How Can We Do It?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Check your quota. See how many booklets you must still put out to reach your quota by the end of April. Each publisher should get from the stockkeeper a sufficient supply of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> to reach this quota, and a like number of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font1"> Then go to work with the determination to place all of these booklets by the end of April. In order to do this it will be necessary to put in time. It is a real joy to see the splendid increase in hours put into the field service by the publishers, and now, with spring coming on, and good weather, we should expect the hours in the field to be doubled by company publishers, and</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">The most gratifying thing about the report is the great increase in subscriptions. There were 68,408 new subscriptions. A few of these were for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font1"> A marked increase is seen in the number of publishers in the field compared with previous years, there being 53,058 publishers in the 20 countries reporting thus far. It is really a splendid report for winter months. The placements of books and booklets are low; therefore it behooves every one of the publishers to place more stress on the bound books and booklets, so as to reach the quota set for the worldwide distribution, namely, one million bound books, twelve million the pioneers’ time materially increased. April is a five-Sunday month. It has also five Saturdays. Make every Saturday and Sunday during April, which is the “New Heavens” Testimony Period, a time of special witnessing. If each publisher puts in at least five hours over each Saturday and Sunday he will easily put in 25 hours for the month. Do your planning now. In addition to these 25 hours, you have plenty of back-calls and evening witnessing to do, which will soon bring your hours up to 60.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Evening Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With the longer days, most of the publishers will be able to do witnessing in the evening for an hour or two. Groups of five or ten publishers should arrange for at least two nights a week to work together in certain territory with only the booklets </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font1"> Your testimony can be short and to the point, the two booklets offered on a contribution of 5c. Many homes can be called on in an hour’s time; and our experience in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font1"> campaign showed that, singly, an average of 10 booklets per hour can be placed. With two booklets to place, that would mean about we should easily attain the quota. While the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign is being extended through the month of May, the report for May will not be included in the four-month campaign quota world-wide, but the companies should continue to keep up their “Thermometer” charts until they reach their individual quota, and this surely by the end of May in all instances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is a real joy to consider the table set out on the report of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign ; for it shows zeal and determination on the part of the publishers for the Kingdom to get the message into the hands of the people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">20 an hour. Make this your goal 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another method that has been proved to be successful is to take booklets with you on “sandwich sign” parades advertising your public meetings and distribute booklets on the streets to those persons who show interest. Talk to the people as they are walking along with you. show them the two booklets, invite them to the meeting, and accept then- contributions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Back-calls are going to increase the placement of booklets, because with every one of your back-calls you will leave </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom, </span><span class="font1">and those people on whom you have made a good many calls should be offered a supply of these booklets, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism- or Freedom</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font1"> to distribute among their neighbors and friends.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The publishers In and about Greater New York have been hoping for some time that it might be the scene of a big convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. An organization full of enthusiasm and anxious to have everything “shipshape” is moving forward to make the New York City convention, June 23, 24, 25, a scene of great activity. Their slogan is, “Pack out the Madison Square Garden!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Advertising</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For weeks prior to the convention the publishers in New York City will be advertising by handbills, “sandwich sign” parades, silk screen signs, electric signs, and many other means whereby they can make known the big public meeting to be addressed by Brother Rutherford and held at the Madison Square Garden. While every effort will be made to convey this information to the public weeks in advance, they will need the help of many thousands more of publishers who will swarm into the city at the Manhattan Center two days prior to this big public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses June 23-25 holds forth a rich blessing to all of the anointed and companions who can attend, not only in the spiritual food that will</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Ordering Phonograph Parts</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Every large company has a sound servant appointed by the Society. One of his responsibilities is to look after the sound equipment in the company, whether owned by the company or by individuals. All publishers should take their troubles relative to their sound equipment to their sound servant. He will repair the equipment for you or will order parts through the company servant for the needed repairs. If the instrument cannot be repaired locally, then the sound servant will have it sent to the Society. It will greatly aid the Society if all ordering of parts and returning of equipment are done through the sound servant and company servant, the company servant in all instances signing the letters. Individuals should not write the Society relative to phonographs, unless they are isolated brethren or pioneers not working with companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a great many instances it would save the pioneer much trouble if he took his phonograph or sound equipment to a local repairman, even though it is necessary to pay for his time. It may be cheaper than sending the entire equipment to Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In writing for repairs on any equipment, always give the serial number. If there is a number on any part that needs replacement, give us that number also. If there is no number on it, give us a description of the part to be repaired. If you have trouble with your motor and cannot have it repaired locally, it is not necessary to send the entire equipment to the Society, but only the motor. Pack it carefully, so that it will not be damaged in transit. Do not send any parts to the Society for repair without writing why you are sending them and what is wanted. Always write a separate be provided for them, but in the splendid privileges of service that will be theirs in advertising the King and kingdom, and, in particular, the meeting at Madison Square Garden. It is hoped that 8,000 publishers will be in New York City the first two days of the convention, and that thousands more who are not able to get away Friday and Saturday will be there Sunday to join in the mighty witness unto the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Madison Square Garden is a place known throughout the world, and particularly by people in the United States. There are thousands of people outside of New York City that come to the city on week-end excursions just to see the city. Many of these may be people of good will, and they, too, should be informed of the wonderful opportunity they will have of hearing Brother Rutherford on this Sunday, June 25, at 3 p.m. Publishers in making back-calls, particularly in the eastern part of the United States, from now until the time of the convention, should mention the convention and the great public meeting and tell the people that if they are going to be in New York during this time of the year they should make it a special point to attend the Sunday afternoon lecture. People of good will will be greatly strengthened to see such a mighty throng of people assembled letter regarding such matters. This will save time in the office and make it possible to check on the parts and return them at an early date.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Phonographs</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">It is indeed gratifying to see the large number of orders coming in for phonographs and records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is impossible for the factory at the present time to keep up with the demand, due to a delay of the manufacturer in supplying motors. Your orders now on hand for phonographs will be shipped in four to six weeks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In answer to numerous inquiries received, we wish to state that the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crusade Against Christianity </span><span class="font1">is available in the German language only. It has not been published in English.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Testimony Cards in Foreign Languages</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">We have on hand a limited supply of foreign-language testimony cards for the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font1"> and the three-booklet combination. Publishers witnessing in territory in which one foreign language predominates find such testimony cards very convenient and effective. While they last these testimony cards will be sent free on order. You can obtain testimony cards in the following languages :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riches:</span><span class="font1">Bohemian, Chinese, Danish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian.</span></p>

Hundreds and even thousands of people of good will in all parts of the United States may be able to arrange their business affairs, which require them to go to New York at times, to be there on June 25. Every publisher can now have a share in advertising the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in New York City. With the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> Campaign going on in full swing and each publisher making many back-calls, much interest can be aroused in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do your share of advertising. More details relative to the convention will be set out in a later </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">We are receiving many favorable reports of the splendid results obtained from advertising public meetings by means of “sandwich sign” parades. Some of the brethren, however, are having a little difficulty in getting started in this branch of the work; they seem to be timid or fearful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No one should be abashed or in any wise deterred from doing this or any other feature of the Lord’s work that will advance the Kingdom interests, because of fear of man or false pride. The question each one should ask himself is, “Will</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Transferring Stock</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">Companies and pioneers should order direct from the Society whatever literature and sound equipment they require. If proper consideration is given to making up the orders and they are sent in sufficiently in advance, much unnecessary transferring of literature can be avoided. Whenever it does become necessary to transfer stock, authorization is first to be obtained from the Society before such transaction is put through. Zone servants, as representatives of the Society, may authorize the transferring of stock in line with specific instructions from the Society relating to excessive stock in their zone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 1, column 4) </span><span class="font1">and at the noon hour talk to those people with whom you are eating lunch, and offer them the booklets. A report was recently received stating a small group of publishers placed over 2,000 booklets and a number of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font1"> and obtained subscriptions in an army post. The brethren were aggressive and took advantage of every opportunity. Let our slogan for the remainder of the campaign be, “Make all three thermometers overflow.” This can be accomplished if every publisher puts forth an extraordinary effort to see that his personal quota is reached by the end of April. If not by the end of April, surely by the end of May. Let each one of us first strive to reach our quota on books, booklets and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtotcer</span><span class="font1"> subscriptions by the end of April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The message contained in Fascism </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">or Freedom,</span><span class="font1"> the new publication added to our campaign, contains very essential information for the people of good will. They must be Informed about the Theocracy and see their responsibility toward the Kingdom. The great responsibility</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">this help to advance the Kingdom interests?” The answer in this case is, unquestionably, “Yes.” That should be the end of all controversy. If it will advance the Kingdom Interests and magnify the Lord’s name, everyone on the Lord’s side should enthusiastically participate in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore, let those who have not yet started in this branch of the service reread the instructions contained in the April </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font1"> get their placards and get In the line of march. There is a very great blessing waiting for them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Of the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts, </span><span class="font1">consignments for their territory were made to each company. These should have been placed by the end of April. If not all your </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font1"> are out by that time, continue in May distributing them and trying diligently to see that all these booklets are put in the hands of the people. The distribution of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font1"> will be extended for a longer period of time. It is gratifying to note that many companies are reordering Face </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the Facts,</span><span class="font1"> as they were able to place more in their territory than consigned to them. April and May should be peak months in the distribution of booklets. Let’s turn on the heat with greater activity and watch the thermometers rise.</span></p>

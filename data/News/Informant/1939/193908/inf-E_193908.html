<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>“Divine Mandate” World-wide Testimony Period Begins</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Entire Month of August Set Aside</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A Period of Intense Activity Offer </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Salvation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah graciously furnishes His people with information for their guidance and salvation, and then the command is: “Freely ye have received, freely give.” The book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font2"> now provided by the Lord, contains information that is vitally necessary for all who expect to receive the protection of the Lord during “His strange act”, when the wicked will be annihilated, and the responsibility to “warn them from me” now devolves upon those who have been advised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to properly obey these commandments, special periods have been set aside for the purpose, and the entire month of August, appropriately designated “Divine Mandate” Testimony Period, will be used in taking to those of good will the information concerning Jehovah’s divine mandate, as set forth in the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font2"> The book will be offered to the people on a contribution of 25c. Always be prepared to offer a combination of booklets when they do not take </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation. </span><span class="font2">A bookmark should be left with each one taking </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> (and, for that matter, any other bound book), and each individual should be briefly encouraged to come to the study at your Kingdom hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every one of the remnant and great multitude will have determined by now, and made plans accordingly, to spend every moment possible during the month of August, setting aside some time each day for sharing with other lovers of righteousness in bearing these tidings of good to the people. As both Jehovah God</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Servants Please Note</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There has been an increasing number of company servants who leave blank some of the spaces on the monthly report card which they send to the Society. This is especially true regarding the total number of different individual publishers taking part in the service during the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order for the Society's records to be correct it is necessary for the brethren to enter all the information requested, including the total number of different individual publishers. If there is only one person active, write the figure </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font2"> in the column headed “Total Different Individual Publishers”. Indicate how many actually participated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Always check your reports carefully before mailing, to see that all the information requested has been given. Again study thoroughly the letter regarding reporting. Do not put on your report card any information that is not requested by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Company servants should send their reports promptly, both to the Society and to the zone servant. and Christ Jesus are unselfish, so are all true Christians, and we will therefore unselfishly devote ourselves to the Lord’s service at this time. To have this rare privilege now is a joy immeasurable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During August we shall still have long daylight hours, making it possible for us to spend considerable time witnessing each day. Those engaging in secular work will take advantage of this by spending time after working hours in carrying this book to the people. The “Divine Mandate” Testimony Period should see not only an increase in the number of those who, by Jehovah’s grace, attain the 60-hour goal, but many of our back-call and model-study interest having a share for the first time in the witness. Encourage these </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">early</span><span class="font2"> to take a definite stand for the Kingdom I There is danger in waiting ! The responsibility rests on us, particularly the anointed, to extend our hand to these seeking the way to Zion and invite them to go along with us and see the King’s zeal for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REMEMBER: Each company publisher is responsible for placing eight </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font2"> and each pioneer publisher sixty, during “Divine Mandate” Period, August 1-31 inclusive. Use your bookmarks. Advertise </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font2">in your electric signs. Place </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> with all those for whom you have slips in your back-call file; and if you place all your </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font2">before you can get another supply, use </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> to carry on the campaign. Make the entire month one of intense activity, to the Lord’s praise I</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Kingdom News” Gives True Story of Madison Square Garden </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">One Million Distributed in New York City in Five Days</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">All Newspapers to Be Served with Copy</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Newspapers of New York City and throughout the country gave to the American people a riot story of the Garden, some of them stating that the meeting was broken up, that the speaker never finished, and many other untrue statements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So that the New York public might learn the truth the Society published </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font2"> No. 4. The presses were working day and night turning out a million copies. The publishers in Greater New York area went into fighting action. The distribution began Saturday, July 15, and by Wednesday evening the 19th one million copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font2">were in the hands of the people. It was a glorious campaign. Much interest had been manifested since</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Are Your </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Booklets in the Hands of the People?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every company servant and stockkeeper should check their stock as to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font2"> If you have any more of these on hand this should be brought to the attention of the publishers and they should be placed during August and September, particularly in the rural sections. While August and September are the months in which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> will have a tremendous distribution, there are many people who will not have had the opportunity to read </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font2">or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font2"> These should be taken along and left on a small contribution or, in places where the people cannot afford to obtain </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> or even make a small contribution for the booklets, one of these should be left with them if they promise to read it. Let’s have the final distribution of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font2"> completed in August and September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Zone servants visiting the companies will also check the stock of these two booklets, because it is a message the people should have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Placards for Information Marches</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">New placards for information marches will be furnished by the Society in a few months. Notice of this will appear in the next </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> In the meantime use the placards you have on hand.</span></p>

Distribute to the principal papers all the copies you receive. We can give the newspapers the opportunity of publishing the truth if they so desire.

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>40,000 Publishers!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Divine Mandate” Period Should Have That Many</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord is pushing the battle to the gate, forcing the enemy out into the open. There can be no compromise now. Everyone must take his stand either for Jehovah or for totalitarianism. There is no middle ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord has guaranteed to protect and preserve those who put their trust in Him. There are more than thirty different prophetic pictures provided by the Lord and appearing in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> book in the chapter “Great Multitude”, showing the Lord’s arrangement to protect and preserve those who put their trust in him and serve him, and in every case this preservation and protection is conditional. The creature obtaining it must be faithful. That means to be a faithful witness that Jehovah is God and to use the equipment the Lord provides to carry the message of the Kingdom to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are many more than 40,000 associated with the various companies in the United States, quite a number of whom do not regularly participate in this Kingdom service. It should be kept clearly in mind that none of those who are physically able to do so but refrain from participation in the Lord’s service regularly can hope to apply to themselves the wonderful promises the Lord makes to the classes mentioned above, nor any of the other promises the Lord makes in the Bible for those who are faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These are serious times, and we are presenting this matter to the brethren everywhere in all seriousness. There is no good reason why we should not have 40,000 or more publishers in the field each month, nor excuse for not having them. Let us then, by the Lord’s grace, make August a real “Divine Mandate” Period by everyone’s joyfully participating in the Kingdom service— 40,000 or more publishers in August and for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Extra Copies of “Kingdom News”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If the company desires to have some extra copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font2">for their own use or for distribution to the people of good will, these can be ordered from the Society—1,000 copies on a contribution of $1.00. This paper will be of real interest, particularly to those people of good will who listen to the lecture “Government and Peace” when you run it for them in their home on a back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah God is now carrying forward his “strange work”, and we are grateful to him for the privileges of service we have. The new records, which will be ready the latter part of August, will, we feel sure, play a great part in the “strange work” which is being performed in this day.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Government and Peace” and “Victory” Records Available</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Each Publisher Should Have Record P-204, “Snare and Racket”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Order Blank</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every one of the Lord’s people Is anxious to put to use these new records. “Government and Peace” Is an exact reproduction of what occurred at Madison Square Garden and reveals the masterly delivery on the part of Brother Rutherford of this stirring message. What a blessing it is that we can have this remarkable talk recorded exactly as delivered and continue to use it throughout the world in the Interests of God’s kingdom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The lecture “Victory” was also recorded and is another remarkable talk to be used among people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Snare and Racket”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This lecture appears under the number P-204 and is a record that every one of the publishers should carry with him from door to door and run it for the people, as it contains information they should have and will be a great assistance to each publisher in arranging for back-calls and placing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Filthiness of Flesh</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">In view of correspondence coming into this office, the following excerpts are published, as taken from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> March 1, 1935, pages 76-80, and it is suggested that the entire article appearing in said </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> be taken up and discussed sincerely at a service meeting of all companies:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Is the use of tobacco, then, clean or filthy within the meaning of the Scriptures? The use of tobacco is exceedingly filthy, regardless of the form in which it is used. It befouls the body and dulls the mental faculties. It makes the user offensive to those with whom he comes in contact, and works great injury to the user and is a dishonor to God and Christ. The use of tobacco has greatly demoralized the human race. It creates an appetite for other impure and filthy things. The poison thereof calls for other poisonous things, creating an appetite for such. Under no condition is the use of tobacco approved by God’s Word. It is entirely inconsistent for anyone of God’s temple company to use the filthy weed, and for that reason no one using tobacco is permitted to remain at the Bethel home. For the same reason it is inconsistent for anyone who represents the Watch Toweb Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tbact Society to use tobacco either to chew or to smoke. Pioneers, zone servants, regional servants, and others, are the direct representatives of the Watch Toweb Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. To be sure, the Society has no power or authority to say that a person who desires to use tobacco cannot do so, but the Society can properly say it will not co-operate with those who do insist upon using tobacco, and therefore will not willingly make such persons the representatives of the Society. Those persons, therefore, who conclude that they must use tobacco, and who prefer to do so rather than to participate in the Lord’s work under the direction of the Society, are at full liberty to choose which course they wish to take. Those who conclude that they must use tobacco, and who are now representatives of the Society, may so notify the Service Department at Brooklyn, and their names will be withdrawn from the list. If to such persons the use of tobacco is more important than serving God’s king-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Order Blank</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> there is being sent an order blank which every company servant should fill out properly. Check with the company as to the number of sets of “Victory”-“Government and Peace” you need, and how many additional records, P-203, P-204, you will require for each of the publishers. By using this order blank and sending it to the Brooklyn office before October 1 you will be able to take advantage of the special rate the Society is making of 50c a disc. However, complete sets must be ordered, and as many additional discs of “Snare and Racket” as are required; this to be made all in one shipment, so as to save on carrying charges. These records will be ready for delivery immediately after the factory reopens on August 7. No need to send your orders in before that time. Along with the order for records you may order </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> and other books and booklets that you require.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord has provided us with the material. Let’s put it to good use in back-calls and public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">dom as one of his witnesses, then let such persons go ahead and satisfy their selfish appetites, but do not expect the Society to authorize such a person to represent it in the proclamation of the Kingdom message. We are in a time of greatest importance, when every one of the Lord’s people must be on the alert. Those who want to represent the Lord and his kingdom must be clear of mind and hence avoid all things that Satan can use to interfere with their service. ... 2 Corinthians 7:1, . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Evil is that which works Injury. No person is justified in working injury to himself, and certainly it is wrong to work injury to another. The use of such a poisonous weed as tobacco works Injury both to the user and to those who are in contact with the user. This is particularly true with regard to smoking tobacco. . . . There is every reason against the use of tobacco; there is not one reason that supports its use. Surely, then, no Christian who is serving God could have an honest and sincere desire at any time to use the filthy weed. By doing so he is working Injury, hence doing evil, and is following ‘the evil way’. These things God declares that he hates. The fact that Jehovah hates that which works evil, coupled with the fact that tobacco does work evil, is conclusive proof that tobacco is the Devil’s weed employed for the purpose of demoralizing human creatures. . . . The contaminating influence thereof has spread to all parts of the earth. Imagine Eve in the garden of Eden with a cigarette in her lips.”—Pages 77, 78.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The above, however, does not authorize zone servants or regional servants to take direct action against any newly interested people of good will that have not yet broken off the tobacco habit privately, but refrain from using it when out in the field service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Divine Mandate” Testimony Period should find 40,000 publishers in the field distributing “Salvation”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Our September Service</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">By the end of August we shall have been thoroughly “broken in” and “all set” to continue with the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font2"> and so we will continue with this offer during the month of September. The book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> was mentioned on both Saturday and Sunday at the end of Brother Rutherford’s lectures, the latter of which was broadcast worldwide, and therefore it is our duty to reach all of those who have been advised of the book and desire a copy. We should get our individual territories covered as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Additionally, witness parties should be arranged during the month, particularly during week-ends. September 2-4 furnishes a good opportunity for rural activity, as many engaging in secular work will be free on those three days to engage in Kingdom service. Let’s try to get our rurals covered before winter sets in and closes that field to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">September ends the fiscal year, and a special endeavor will be made by pioneers and companies to meet their year’s quota on bound books before the end of the month. Always take plenty of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> along with you. Don’t get caught “running out”. Place additional orders with the Society for your September needs now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> had a large distribution during the early months of their release. Let’s do all we can to surpass that distribution. The issue is drawn more clearly, and those of good will are more anxious to know the truth. We have learned to be better publishers. We have more publishers, and expect to have 40,000 this month. There is every reason why we should make September the biggest month ever. By the Lord’s grace, we shall. We had a quota of 8 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> per company publisher during August. Let’s equal or surpass that during September!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Phonograph Orders</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">We have promised those ordering phonographs that they will be shipped in about 6 or 8 weeks. We regret that we have fallen behind this schedule, but, due to the convention and the tremendous demand for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font2"> we have been unable to do as much work on the phonographs as we should like. We expect to get in full swing in manufacturing phonographs the latter part of August, and hope to catch up on all orders within two months. If you have ordered a phonograph and have not received it, do not make inquiry about it for the present. It will be filled just as soon as possible.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Subscriptions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Brethren speaking foreign languages and associated with companies should turn in their subscriptions to the company servant for forwarding to the Society. Some brethren speaking foreign languages write the Society in their respective language, but if they use the regular renewal slips, and show definitely in which language they want </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font2"> the matter will be given quicker attention if done through the company servant.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Orders and August Work</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Companies whose account and activity justify it have been sent a reasonable consignment of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation. </span><span class="font2">However, there is always the possibility that some companies will run out of this new book before another order can be obtained. If this should happen, do not stop work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">August is a bound - book month. If </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> runs out, use </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font2">or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> or any other bound book. Keep pushing the campaign with bound books. Send in your order and it will be filled as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers have been requested by post card and In the July </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font2">to get their orders for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> in here by July 12 and they would be filled before the Bethel home and factory close. Orders are still coming in (almost a week) after the dead line. We will do our best to fill as many as we can, but if your order for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> is not filled, do not stop work, but push the campaign with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Riches</span><span class="font2"> or some other bound book.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Bookmarks</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">The purpose of the bookmarks which the Society furnishes is to have the reader of the books attend a local study. So that the people may know the address of the local study, the Society prints on these bookmarks the address of the company and time of meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When a company sends orders to the Society for bookmarks the special order blank should be used for this purpose. Be very specific as to the name of the hall, the street address, the city and state, and time of meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pioneers in company territory should secure from the company such bookmarks as they need, as this is to the advantage of the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Isolated pioneers have no use for the bookmarks unless they begin a meeting which will be permanent. Orders for bookmarks will not be accepted If for less than 250.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>With This </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Informant</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">With this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> there Is being mailed an order blank for the records “Government and Peace”, “Victory” and “Snare and Racket”.

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>New Year Starts with New Literature</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Another year has passed and now we are ready to begin the fiscal year of 1943 with “The Wise&quot; Testimony Period. Those who are wise understand the Lord’s purposes and look wholeheartedly to the Lord and His organization for instruction and are zealous to obey the Lord at all times. Such persons put The Theocracy ahead of everything else, and focus their attention on the new world. Everyone who has been out in the service during the past year will want to get into this “The Wise” testimony campaign during the month of October. We have several new instruments to use in the service and it will indeed be a real joy to start right now. Don’t wait until the campaign is nearly over before you start, but make it a fl'll month of heal activity. Come on, company publishers, let all strive to reach a new all-time high for company publishers, hours and back-calls in October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“The New World”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Just now much is being said by the world powers about the “world after the war”. The democracies say that they will win the war and bring peace and happiness to those who survive the present world conflict, while the totalitarians claim that they are going to win the war and have full control of the whole earth. Already they are making plans as to how they will run things after this war is over. Thinking people and people of good-will are asking: What is the new world? How will it operate? Who will be in control? What will be the condition of the people then? All these, and many more questions that are in the minds of all honest people are clearly and completely answered in the new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World,</span><span class="font1"> just released at the New World Theocratic Assembly. You have all read your copy of this new publication by now and have enjoyed it more than anything you ever read before. Now is the time when we must “comfort all that mourn”, and this new provision from the Lord's table will accomplish that very thing. The brethren everywhere are joining in the “call to action” and are going ahead with new strength and renewed vigor and enthusiasm for the Kingdom. This new publication should be placed with the people wherever possible, and back-calls made. “The Wise” Testimony Period is the time to begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Peace—Can It Last?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a companion of the new publication </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Neto World</span><span class="font1"> is the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font1"> This new booklet should be distributed far and wide. One should be placed with every bound book, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World. </span><span class="font1">Every person of good-will should have a copy and be encouraged to study it carefully. Use every means possible to get this booklet into the hands of the people. The book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> and the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peace— Can It Last?</span><span class="font1"> will be placed on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font1">contribution of 25c. Where the entire combination cannot be placed, try to leave </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font1"> on any contribution, or free if the people are interested and cannot contribute anything for it. Most of the brethren have obtained a supply of these new publications at the Assembly. and you should concentrate on these as long as they last. If you haven’t received your regular shipment by the time you run out of literature, then you should use </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hope</span><span class="font1"> on a 25c contribution as heretofore, until your shipment of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font1"> arrives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With these two new. up-to-the-minute weapons it will he quite easy to go to the people and tell them about the Lord's provisions for them in the new world—it is a message of hope, cheer, and comfort. Start this new jenr with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">'I he New World</span><span class="font1"> and give it a send-off that will delight the hearts of thousands or millions of sincere seekers of the truth. It is jour privilege to have a part in this work, and you should not waste anytime getting started. Each one should be ready to jump right in and do his share of the work without a murmur. I’ut to use &quot;the sword of the Spirit” in door-to-door and back-call work. There is no doubt that this is the Lord's provision; so there is no reason to hesitate or hold back from proceeding &quot;full speed ahead”. Get busy, and give it all you have. Begin &quot;The Wise” Testimony Period with so much pep and vigor that it will make the Devil's crowd sweat! Defeat persecution I</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>“The Sword of the Spirit” a Real Weapon</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">As announced tit the New World Theocratic Assembly, the Lord has provided Ills people with a new threshing instrument, the new Bible. The scripture text of this Bible is what is generally referred to as the standard King James Version. The other features of the Bible, however, including a very line concordance, proper names, maps, illustrations, and other exclusive features, are entirely Theocratic. These features have been prepared by consecrated brethren with a clear vision of the Kingdom and are intended for Kingdom service. Every publisher should have his own personal copy of this Bible, so as to be able to wield this “sword of the Spirit” to the glory of the Lord and the advancement of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This Bible can be had by all the</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>No Consignments to Be Made Get All Supplies at Once</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">The new book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span><span class="font1"> and the booklet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peace—Can It Last?</span><span class="font1"> will not be consigned. Therefore, in order to have an adequate supply of these gracious provisions of the Lord it will be necessary for all companies and pioneers to put in their orders immediately. The sooner we get the orders, the sooner they will be filled. However, close co-operation should be established between pioneers and companies to see that, if possible, all orders are made for 100-pound shipments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The company servant should endeavor to contact all pioneers in the company's territory, and the pioneers should make it their business to get in touch with the company-servant or stock servant when working in company territory, and send in their orders together. It is very difficult in this office, when orders come in separately, to locate them and put them together. Therefore, orders for two or more parties at one address should all be sent in together in one envelope. Orders for the new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font1"> No. 11 should also be included with the above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneers working in groups and not in company territory should send in their orders in one envelope and have them all shipped in the name of one party. Pioneers when making out orders to be sent in with those of other pioneers should clearly mark at the top of their order blank, on the line “Ship to”, not their own name, but the name of the party or company to whom the order is going to be shipped ; and on the line indicating to whom the order is to be charged, show their own name, so that it will be charged to the proper account.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Call to Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers Needed by Spring</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As announced at the convention, a call is going out through the length of the land for more pioneers in the field. Those who are “new world”-conscious and can possibly do so will respond to this call, and they will find that it will result in their everlasting welfare, and their faithful course of action will bring honor to Jehovah's name. Have you made full examination of your own personal circumstances, examining them in the light of the Scriptures, that is, with an eye single to the Lord's glory, not looking to your own personal desires or “old world” ambitions. but taking the course as the Lord instructs?—that is, “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him. and he shall direct thy paths.” (Prov. 3:5,6) Those who, after fully examining themselves, brethren, companies and pioneers, on a contribution of .$1.00. This Bible is not released to the public yet. For regular door-to-door witnessing, continue to use the No. 116 Bible until further announcement.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">If the brethren will take these precautions it will greatly aid the Society in making the shipments and insure prompt and effective cooperation from the Society's headquarters in Brooklyn and the various depots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Have in mind these things when you place your order :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new Bible, $1.00 for those brethren who did not get their copy at the Assembly;</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">and any other supplies you need, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font1"> No. 116 Bibles, and other books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The sooner your order gets in, the sooner it will be shipped. All orders will be filled according to the dates on which they are received at the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">find that their circumstances will permit them to enter into the pioneer service, both the brothers and the sisters, should immediately write the Brooklyn office at 117 Adams St., asking for a pioneer application blank. Remember the New World Assembly call, “Ten thousand pioneers by next spring.” If you cannot enter now, start now getting your affairs into shape to be a pioneer by spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Also those brethren who are pioneers and who find it necessary to leave the pioneer service should immediately notify this office of such, so that the proper adjustment can be made on the records here and their names taken from the pioneer roll. Particularly do we have in mind those young pioneers who enrolled for (he duration of the summer school vacation and who must now go back to school. They should notify the Society at once if they have not done so, that the proper adjustment may be made. By having the full co-operation of all the brethren in this regard, the pioneer roll will contain only the names of those that are actually meeting the pioneer requirements, and thus the average for the pioneers as a whole will not be brought down by those that are unable to meet the requirements.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>“Servants to the Brethren” Will Visit Every Company Twice a Year</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah’s Theocratic Government is increasing and moving forward in united action. As the work progresses the Lord brings to the attention of His servants on earth additional Theocratic instructions, thereby necessitating some changes in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation Instructions.</span><span class="font1"> These new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation Instructions</span><span class="font1"> apply to Jehovah's witnesses and their companions in all parts of the earth and will be put into effect by all branches. These instructions are from the Lord through Ills “faithful and wise servant”. They apply to all companies, large and small, without qualification or limitation. They will be found entirely consistent and easily applied to any and all territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font1"> are always the property of the Society and are provided to the local company organization and pioneers for the purpose of carrying on the work in a uniform manner, and if there are any changes in servants these confidential instructions will be transferred to the new servants. Servants relinquishing their positions for any reason are not to hold on to these instructions, but are to turn them over to their successor. Pioneers when leaving that branch of the service are to return their copy of these instructions to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation Instructions </span><span class="font1">go into effect for all companies, pioneers and special pioneers throughout the United States, and in all countries reporting direct to the Brooklyn office, on October 1, 1942. One copy is supplied for each servant in your company organization. One copy will be sent to each pioneer publisher. They should at once be carefully and thoroughly studied by each servant and pioneer. These brethren should be prepared to put into operation immediately the various features of the Kingdom activity outlined therein. The different features of the present company setup which do not conform to these new organization instructions will be adjusted to conform to them. Changes in the titles of the various offices in the company organization to conform to these new instructions are to be made on October 1, 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Regarding the committee of three who are to make recommendations to the Society: The title of secretary will be changed to that of assistant company servant, at once, and future reference to the assistant company servant in this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font1">has reference to this office. The present company servant, assistant company servant and back-call servant will comprise the committee for making the recommendations to the Society from October 1, 1942, onward. They will be responsible for carrying out the duties assigned to that committee in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation Instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where the person serving as assistant company servant or back-call servant is a sister and there are competent brothers available In the company, brothers should be recommended immediately to replace the sisters in these positions. The recommendations for such changes may be made by the servants now holding office. If any of these brethren need assistants for office work, such as stenographers, such assistants may be chosen and may be either brothers or sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As outlined in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Every Publisher to Know Them</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Don’t Miss a Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation Instructions,</span><span class="font1"> effective October 1, reveal the “path” or “way” in which Jehovah's devoted servants are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font1"> walk now. To follow Jehovah's instruction leads to the way of life, and the wise person will always heed and follow those instructions and thus take them unto himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The instructions are prepared for the everyday use and application of each publisher. Each publisher has the privilege of diligently studying and absorbing all the information contained in them so that he may act properly and in harmony with the Lord's revealed will. They are to be used by applying them in all phases of the regular witness work. Jesus gave the proper example of how to use the Lord’s instruction (the Bible) by meeting every I situation by referring to the fact that “it is written” to do thus and <sup>1</sup> so. That example all publishers of The Theocracy will follow by always stating ‘it is written’ in the Lord’s organization instructions, and by thus doing they will be leaning to the Lord for guidance and not to their own understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So that the brethren may get thoroughly acquainted with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation Instructions,</span><span class="font1"> the company servant of each company is to arrange to have them studied at the first eight service meetings after they have been received, spending thirty minutes on them at each meeting. These are to be studied in the same manner as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> is studied. That is, the conductor is to prepare questions on the portion assigned, and after the question is answered and all matter covered the paragraph will be read. The company servant is to assign each servant in the company the particular part of the instructions it because some don't fully appreciate their privilege of engaging in I he Lord's service? The privilege of engaging in the Lord's service is the greatest privilege ever offered to mankind, and we are among the few people who have been enlightened by the Lord to see and appreciate this honor. We should, therefore, seize upon every opportunity to give a testimony to the Lord's name. Make every spare moment be used to tell someone about the New World and its blessings, wherever you may be. Each one should carefully examine himself and see where he can improve his service, in an effort to become a better servant of the Most High God. We hope to see an increase in all phases of the work beginning with &quot;The Wise” Testimony Period. । Start “The Wise” Testimony Period by being a good company publisher. With all the new instruments with which we have been blessed, there is no reason why we cannot score a new peak in company publishers and hours during this campaign. Here is the report for the month of August, 1942.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Instructions,</span><span class="font1"> the one recommended to serve as assistant company servant should be. next to the company servant, the most capable brother in the company. No other changes in servants should be recommended until after the servant to the brethren visits your company, unless an emergency arises due to brethren moving away or being unable to serve for some other reason. All the other servants in the company will continue to serve in their respective positions, excepting the sound servant. This position is being entirely eliminated. The brethren now serving in that capacity will turn over to the advertising servant all files, phonographs and records and all other data and equipment he may have that ai&gt;plies to that position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Servants to the Brethren</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These brethren are special representatives of the Society who are sent from company to company on schedule. The companies that are to be visited each month are sent a questionnaire, to be filled out in detail as outlined in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation Instructions.</span><span class="font1"> The committee of three, composed of the company servant, assistant company servant and back-call servant, should give Immediate attention to the careful and prayerful filling out of this questionnaire, particularly those companies to whom the servant to the brethren has been assigned early in October. During the first two weeks in October the servants to the brethren will be unable to carry on any extended advance correspondence regarding their appointments. Therefore they will write each company servant where they are assigned to serve, giving full information regarding the time, way and manner of their arrival, so that the company brethren can with the least possible difficulty or confusion arrange to meet them. The proper advance preparation for meeting w’ith the servants and the company should be taken care of immediately by the company servant. After the first few weeks in October the manner of contact between the company and the servants to the brethren outlined in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation Instructions</span><span class="font1"> will be carried out, as all parties concerned will have had ample time to conduct the necessary advance correspondence.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>It Is Up to You</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">When shall we reach a new peak in company publishers? The Lord has always placed definite requirements on each one of his servants, and it is the responsibility of each to fulfill that requirement to the best of his ability. The requirements that the Lord has placed on company publishers are very reasonable, and the fact that many company publishers meet all these requirements every month proves that “it can be done”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Why, then, is the report so low for the month of August, 1942? Is</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Study of “Organization Instructions”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">applying to him and he is to act as chairman for that portion. It will be noted, also, that some of the instructions apply to various subjects in general and not to any particular servant and his duties in the company. For such part the company servant can select some capable brother (study conductor or other) in the company, and this brother can prepare questions and conduct the consideration of the portion that is assigned to him. If no other brother is at hand to do this, then the company servant may take this himself. The purpose of such study is to make familiar, and impress upon the minds of all the publishers, the new setup, the new instructions, how they apply to each of them, and thus ’burn into’ their mind and heart the importance of taking them unto themselves and following them because they lead to the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the end of each 30-minute study the next week’s portion, of about four pages, should be read by a good reader, so that the brethren will be acquainted with the subject matter before questions are asked at the study the next week, and there answered and summed up by the reading of each paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation Instructions</span><span class="font1"> are always open to any and all of the publishers. However, they are always to be kept in the possession of the servants with whom they are entrusted, and are not to be loaned. After the eight-week period of study, if any of the publishers have any particular point or question regarding the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organisation Instructions, </span><span class="font1">they may see the company servant, who will let them look up and find whatever information they are seeking. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions </span><span class="font1">are always the property of the Society, and are merely held in trust by the servants in the company. We believe, however, that the brethren as a whole will have a very good understanding of the instructions after the eight-week study period. “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.”—Psalm 40: 8.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Keep the Magazines Going</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Do you have a store-to-store magazine route? If not, you are missing a good opportunity to get the light concerning the new world into the hands of many persons that otherwise would scarcely be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is suggested that the advertising servant, in addition to his territory assignment system for street-corner magazine witnessing, make up a sufficient number of business territory assignments and, upon request by the publishers, assign them a certain block or so of the business territory for these publishers to engage in the store-to-store magazine work. Of course, these territory assignments would not be valid for anything else than this one phase of the witness work. The publisher holding the territory embracing this business section would have exclusive rights to witness in same with the regular current offer as authorized in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font1">After such an arrangement is made up, the publishers can check out a territory that is convenient to them and work regularly, on schedule, with both </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font1"> placing these with the business managers, clerks and others, with the end in view of establishing a regular route with regular ob-tainers of the magazines. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Try it</span></p>
